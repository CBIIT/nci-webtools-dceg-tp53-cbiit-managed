    "Title": "Molecular cloning and in vitro expression of a cDNA clone for human cellular tumor antigen p53",
    "Abstract": "Three clones for the human tumor antigen p53 were isolated from a cDNA library prepared from A431 cells. One of these clones, pR4-2, contains the entire coding region for human p53. This clone directs the synthesis of a polypeptide with the correct molecular weight and immunological epitopes of an authentic p53 molecule in an in vitro transcription-translation reaction. Although the pR4-2 clone contains the coding region for p53, it is not a full-length copy of the human p53 mRNA. Northern analysis showed that the p53 mRNA is approximately 2,500 nucleotides long, whereas the pR4-2 insert is only 1,760 base pairs in length. Analysis of the DNA sequence of this clone suggests that the human p53 polypeptide has 393 amino acids. We compared the predicted amino acid sequence of the pR4-2 clone with similar clones for the mouse p53 and found long regions of amino acid homology between these two molecules",

    "Title": "Major deletions in the gene encoding the p53 tumor antigen cause lack of p53 expression in HL-60 cells",
    "Abstract": "The tumor antigen p53 is overproduced in transformed cells of various species, including man. HL-60 is an exceptional human tumor cell line that does not express this protein. Hybridization of polyadenylylated mRNA of these cells with a human p53 cDNA probe (p53-H14), which we cloned, had indicated a total absence of the mature-size (3.0 kilobases) or any aberrant p53 mRNA species. Analysis of the genomic HL-60 DNA indicated that the p53 gene in these cells was significantly altered. Most of the gene was deleted, and the residual p53 sequences of these cells, which show weak homology, mapped to the corresponding 5' region of the p53 gene. In agreement with previously documented results, we found that HL-60 cells have an amplified c-myc gene. We suggest that the deficiency of the p53 protein in HL-60 cells could have been overcome by using an alternative metabolic pathway. The c-myc product is a candidate for such an alternative protein",

    "Title": "Molecular basis for heterogeneity of the human p53 protein",
    "Abstract": "The human p53 tumor antigen comprises several physically distinct proteins. Two p53 proteins, separable by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, are expressed by the human transformed cell line SV-80. The individual cDNAs which code for these proteins were isolated and constructed into the SP6 transcription vector. The proteins encoded by these clones were identified by in vitro transcription with the SP6 vector and translation in a cell-free system. p53-H-1 and p53-H-19 cDNA clones code for the faster- and slower-migrating p53 protein species, respectively, of SV-80. The in vitro-expressed proteins of p53-H-1 and p53-H-19 had the same antigenic determinants and were structurally indistinguishable from their in vivo counterparts. By expressing defined restricted cDNA fragments in vitro, the region of heterogeneity between the respective cDNAs was located at the 5' end of the cDNAs. Exchanging the 5' fragments of interest and expressing the chimeric clones in vitro confirmed that the DNA heterogeneity was responsible for the difference in the electrophoretic mobility of these proteins. The sequences of the two cDNAs revealed a single base pair difference (G versus C) in the coding region of the clones. This sequence difference resulted in an arginine being coded for in clone p53-H-1 and a proline being coded for at the equivalent position in clone p53-H-19. This variation accounted for the change in the electrophoretic mobility of the individual p53 protein species",

    "Title": "Mutations in the p53 gene occur in diverse human tumour types",
    "Abstract": "The p53 gene has been a constant source of fascination since its discovery nearly a decade ago. Originally considered to be an oncogene, several convergent lines of research have indicated that the wild-type gene product actually functions as a tumour suppressor gene. For example, expression of the neoplastic phenotype is inhibited, rather than promoted, when rat cells are transfected with the murine wild-type p53 gene together with mutant p53 genes and/or other oncogenes. Moreover, in human tumours, the short arm of chromosome 17 is often deleted. In colorectal cancers, the smallest common region of deletion is centred at 17p13.1; this region harbours the p53 gene, and in two tumours examined in detail, the remaining (non-deleted) p53 alleles were found to contain mutations. This result was provocative because allelic deletion coupled with mutation of the remaining allele is a theoretical hallmark of tumour-suppressor genes. In the present report, we have attempted to determine the generality of this observation; that is, whether tumours with allelic deletions of chromosome 17p contain mutant p53 genes in the allele that is retained. Our results suggest that (1) most tumours with such allelic deletions contain p53 point mutations resulting in amino-acid substitutions, (2) such mutations are not confined to tumours with allelic deletion, but also occur in at least some tumours that have retained both parental 17p alleles, and (3) p53 gene mutations are clustered in four 'hot-spots' which exactly coincide with the four most highly conserved regions of the gene. These results suggest that p53 mutations play a role in the development of many common human malignancies",

    "Title": "Chromosome 17 deletions and p53 gene mutations in colorectal carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that allelic deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 occur in over 75% of colorectal carcinomas. Twenty chromosome 17p markers were used to localize the common region of deletion in these tumors to a region contained within bands 17p12 to 17p13.3. This region contains the gene for the transformation- associated protein p53. Southern and Northern blot hybridization experiments provided no evidence for gross alterations of the p53 gene or surrounding sequences. As a more rigorous test of the possibility that p53 was a target of the deletions, the p53 coding regions from two tumors were analyzed; these two tumors, like most colorectal carcinomas, had allelic deletions of chromosome 17p and expressed considerable amounts of p53 messenger RNA from the remaining allele. The remaining p53 allele was mutated in both tumors, with an alanine substituted for valine at codon 143 of one tumor and a histidine substituted for arginine at codon 175 of the second tumor. Both mutations occurred in a highly conserved region of the p53 gene that was previously found to be mutated in murine p53 oncogenes. The data suggest that p53 gene mutations may be involved in colorectal neoplasia, perhaps through inactivation of a tumor suppressor function of the wild-type p53 gene",

    "Title": "p53: a frequent target for genetic abnormalities in lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "Allele loss is a hallmark of chromosome regions harboring recessive oncogenes. Lung cancer frequently demonstrates loss of heterozygosity on 17p. Recent evidence suggests that the p53 gene located on 17p13 has many features of such an antioncogene. The p53 gene was frequently mutated or inactivated in all types of human lung cancer. The genetic abnormalities of p53 include gross changes such as homozygous deletions and abnormally sized messenger RNAs along with a variety of point or small mutations, which map to the p53 open reading frame and change amino acid sequence in a region highly conserved between mouse and man. In addition, very low or absent expression of p53 messenger RNA in lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung was seen. These findings, coupled with the previous demonstration of 17p allele loss in lung cancer, strongly implicate p53 as an anti-oncogene whose disruption is involved in the pathogenesis of human lung cancer",

    "Abstract": "The nuclear phosphoprotein p53 occurs at elevated levels in many transformed cells. Mutant forms of mouse p53 possess enhanced transforming activity compared with wild type p53. Mutant mouse p53 proteins form complexes with the 70 kDa family of heat shock proteins (HSPs). We previously demonstrated an association between p53 and the 70 kDa HSPs in the human osteosarcoma (HOS) derived cell line HOS-SL. We report here the molecular cloning and sequencing of the p53 gene from HOS-SL cells, and demonstrate that it is in fact mutant. Further, analysis of similar HOS-derived cell lines demonstrates that they also encode the same mutant form of p53, whereas the wild type form of p53 appears to be lost in these cells. Stability studies demonstrate an increased half life of the p53 protein in these cells, in keeping with its association with the HSP 70 proteins. A potential role for this p53 mutant in the transformation process is discussed",

Abnormalities in p53 expression were found in 28 of 40 carcinomas, 14 of 17 squamous tumours showing abnormal p53 expression, whereas no expression of p53 was detectable in 7 carcinoid tumours or in 10 normal lung samples. Direct evidence for homozygous expression of mutant p53 mRNA in representative carcinomas was obtained by means of an asymmetric polymerase chain reaction mRNA sequencing strategy, which allowed sequencing without any cloning step. All the mutations were G to T transversions resulting in mis-sense mutations in aminoacids highly conserved in evolution. Mutation of the p53 gene is the most frequently identified genetic change in human lung cancer; these findings suggest that simple immunohistological methods can provide strong evidence of such mutation",

    "Abstract": "The expression of the tumour suppressor gene p53 was analysed in 11 human breast cancer cell lines by immunohistochemistry, immunoprecipitation and cDNA sequencing. We used a panel of anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies for cell staining and found abnormalities in every case. Eight of the cell lines produce a form of p53 which can be immunoprecipitated by the monoclonal antibody PAb240 but not by PAb1620. In the murine system PAb240 only immunoprecipitates mutant p53. We sequenced p53 cDNA directly from four of the PAb240 positive cell lines using asymmetric PCR templates. All four contained missense mutations in p53 RNA, with no detectable expression of the wild type sequence. Different residues were affected in each cell line, but all the mutations changed amino acids conserved from man to Xenopus. These results imply that as in the murine system, the PAb240 antibody reliably detects a wide variety of p53 mutations and that these mutations have a common effect on the structure of p53. Immunohistochemical data suggest that p53 mutation is the commonest genetic alteration so far detected in primary breast cancer",

    "Abstract": "The p53 gene has been implicated as a tumor suppressor gene with mutations found in common human cancers. We examined 51 early stage, primary, resected non-small cell lung cancer specimens using an RNAase protection assay and cDNA sequencing. Mutations changing the p53 coding sequence were found in 23/51 (45%) tumor specimens, but not in the corresponding normal lung, were distributed between codons 132 to 283, and included tumors with and without 17p allele loss. Fifteen of the 23 mutations lay in the predicted binding regions for SV40 large T antigen, and 14 were located in regions highly conserved between species. G to T transversions were a common result of p53 mutations in lung cancer compared to other cancers suggesting exposure to different mutagens. In univariate and multivariate analysis the presence of p53 mutations was associated with younger age and squamous histology. However, the presence of p53 mutations was not significantly associated with tumor stage, nodal status or sex and was found in all histologic types of lung cancer. We conclude that somatic mutations in the p53 gene play an important role in the pathogenesis of early stage non- small cell lung cancer",

In six sarcomas, loss or rearrangement of both alleles of this gene was detected while in a further seven sarcomas, point mutation or absence of transcription of the p53 gene was observed. Abnormalities of the p53 gene were found in several classes of soft tissue sarcoma, including leiomyosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas and malignant fibrous histiocytomas. Our studies also show that abnormalities of the RB1 suppressor gene and of the p53 gene frequently occur together. These results are consistent with the idea that the p53 gene is a tumour suppressor gene and indicate that coincident inactivation of more than one tumour suppressor gene may, in some cases, be required for tumour development",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations occur in combination with 17p allelic deletions as late events in colorectal tumorigenesis",
    "Abstract": "Coordinate loss of one copy of the p53 gene and mutation of the remaining copy occur in colorectal carcinomas and in many other human malignancies. However, the prevalence of p53 gene mutations in carcinomas which maintain both parental copies of p53 has not previously been evaluated. Moreover, it is not known whether p53 gene mutations are limited to malignant tumors or whether they can also occur in benign neoplasms. To answer these questions, a total of 58 colorectal tumors have been examined; in each tumor, allelic losses were assessed using restriction fragment length polymorphisms and p53 gene mutations were assessed by sequencing cloned polymerase chain reaction products. The following conclusions emerged: (a) p53 gene mutations occurred but were relatively rare in adenomas, regardless of size and whether the adenomas were derived from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis; (b) In carcinomas as well as in adenomas, p53 gene mutations were infrequently observed in tumors which contain both copies of chromosome 17p (17% of 30 tumors), while tumors which lost one copy of chromosome 17p usually had a mutation in the remaining p53 allele (86% of 28 tumors); (c) p53 gene mutations were found at similar frequencies in primary tumor samples and in cell lines derived from tumors. These and other data suggest that the rate limiting step in p53 inactivation is point mutation and that once a mutation occurs, loss of the remaining wild-type allele rapidly follows. Both mutations and allelic losses generally occur near the transition from benign to malignant growth, and the p53 gene may play a causal role in this progression",

    "Abstract": "The p53 gene initially was thought to be an oncogene, but recent evidence suggests that wild-type p53 can function as a tumor suppressor gene in lung, colon, and breast cancer as well as less common malignancies. This study reports the first identification of intronic point mutations as a mechanism for inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Abnormally sized p53 mRNAs found in a small cell and a non-small cell lung cancer cell line were characterized by sequence analysis of cDNA/PCR products, the RNase protection assay and immunoprecipitation. These mRNAs were found to represent aberrant splicing leading to the production of abnormal or no p53 protein. Sequence analysis of genomic DNA revealed that a point mutation at the splice acceptor site in the third intron or the splice donor site in the seventh intron accounts for the abnormal mRNA splicing. In one patient the same intronic point mutation was found in the tumor cell line derived from a bone marrow metastasis and in multiple liver metastases but not in normal DNA, indicating that it occurred as a somatic event before the development of these metastases. These findings further support the role of inactivation of the p53 gene in the pathogenesis of lung cancer and indicate the role of intronic point mutation in this process",

    "Abstract": "Human T-cell leukemia and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines were studied for alterations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Southern blot analysis of 10 leukemic T-cell lines revealed no gross genomic deletions or rearrangements. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of p53 mRNA indicated that all 10 lines produced p53 mRNA of normal size. By direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA, we detected 11 missense and nonsense point mutations in 5 of the 10 leukemic T-cell lines studied. The mutations are primarily located in the evolutionarily highly conserved regions of the p53 gene. One of the five cell lines in which a mutation was detected possesses a homozygous point mutation in both p53 alleles, while the other four cell lines harbor from two to four different point mutations. An allelic study of two of the lines (CEM, A3/Kawa) shows that the two missense mutations found in each line are located on separate alleles, thus both alleles of the p53 gene may have been functionally inactivated by two different point mutations. Since cultured leukemic T-cell lines represent a late, fully tumorigenic stage of leukemic T cells, mutation of both (or more) alleles of the p53 gene may reflect the selection of cells possessing an increasingly tumorigenic phenotype, whether the selection took place in vivo or in vitro. Previously, we have shown that the HSB-2 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line had lost both alleles of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Although it has been shown that wild-type p53 can block the ability of E1a and ras to cotransform primary rodent cells, it is poorly understood why inactivation of the p53 gene is important for tumor formation. We show that overexpression of the gene encoding wild-type p53 blocks the growth of osteosarcoma cells. The growth arrest was determined to be due to an inability of the transfected cells to progress into S phase. This suggests that the role of the p53 gene as an antioncogene may be in controlling the cell cycle in a fashion analogous to the check-point control genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",

    "Abstract": "Immunohistological staining of primary colorectal carcinomas with antibodies specific to p53 demonstrated gross overexpression of the protein in approximately 50% of the malignant tumors examined. Benign adenomas were all negative for p53 overexpression. To determine the molecular basis for this overexpression we examined p53 protein expression in 10 colorectal cancer cell lines. Six of the cell lines expressed high levels of p53 in ELISA, cell-staining, and immunoprecipitation studies. Direct sequencing and chemical-mismatch- cleavage analysis of p53 cDNA by using the polymerase chain reaction in these cell lines showed that all cell lines that expressed high levels of p53 were synthesizing mRNAs that encoded mutant p53 proteins. In two of those four cell lines where p53 expression was lower, point mutations were still detected. Thus, we conclude that overexpression of p53 is synonymous with mutation, but some mutations would not be detected by a simple immunohistochemical analysis. Mutation of the p53 gene is one of the commonest genetic changes in the development of human colorectal cancer",

To study the generality and mechanisms of p53 alteration in human cancer, we examined 241 tumors of several types for structural aberrations of the locus. Alterations of the gene or its RNA or protein products consistent with loss of function by either recessive or dominant mechanisms were identified among this set uniquely in rhabdomyosarcomas and osteosarcomas. The alterations of p53 in rhabdomyosarcoma tumors included cases with complete deletion of both p53 alleles, complete deletions of one allele with or without point mutation of the remaining allele, and absence of detectable RNA. Similarly, we detected homozygous deletion and lack of expression of p53 RNA or aberrant expression of p53 protein in osteosarcomas. These observations provide strong support for the inclusion of the p53 locus in the group of loci whose functional inactivation by either dominant or recessive modes plays a significant role in human cancer",

    "Title": "Chromosome 17p deletions and p53 gene mutations associated with the formation of malignant neurofibrosarcomas in von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis",
    "Abstract": "von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) is a common hereditary disorder characterized by neural crest-derived tumors, particularly benign neurofibromas whose malignant transformation to neurofibrosarcomas can be fatal. The NF1 gene has been mapped to a small region of chromosome 17q, but neither the nature of the primary defect nor the mechanisms involved in tumor progression are understood. We have tested whether NF1 might be caused by the inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene on 17q, analogous to that on chromosome 22 in NF2, by searching for deletions of chromosome 17 in NF1-derived tumor specimens. Both neurofibrosarcomas from patients with 'atypical' NF and 5 of 6 neurofibrosarcomas from NF1 patients displayed loss of alleles for polymorphic DNA markers on chromosome 17. However, the common region of deletion was on 17p and did not include the NF1 region of 17q. Since no loss of markers on chromosome 17 was observed in any of 30 benign tumors from NF1 patients, the 17p deletions seen in neurofibrosarcomas are probably associated with tumor progression and/or malignancy. This region contains a candidate gene for tumor progression, p53, which has recently been implicated in the progression of a broad array of human cancers. In a preliminary search for p53 aberrations by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA from 7 neurofibrosarcomas, 2 tumors that contained point mutations in exon 4 of the p53 gene were found, suggesting a role for this gene in at least some neurofibrosarcomas. Thus the formation of malignant neurofibrosarcomas may result from several independent genetic events including mutation of the NF1 gene, whose mechanism of tumorigenesis remains uncertain, and subsequent loss of a 'tumor suppressor' gene on 17p, most likely p53",

We examined four human esophageal carcinoma cell lines and 14 human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing for the presence of p53 mutations in exons 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Two cell lines and five of the tumor specimens contained a mutated allele (one frameshift and six missense mutations). All missense mutations detected occurred at G.C base pairs in codons at or adjacent to mutations previously reported in other cancers. The identification of aberrant p53 gene alleles in one-third of the tumors we tested suggests that mutations at this locus are common genetic events in the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus",

    "Title": "Abnormal structure and expression of p53 gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "There is little information regarding the molecular mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis. We studied the p53 gene at the DNA, RNA, and protein level in seven human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-derived cell lines; six of seven showed p53 abnormalities. By Southern blotting, the p53 gene was found to be partially deleted in Hep 3B and rearranged in SK-HEP-1 cells. Transcripts of the p53 gene were undetectable in Hep 3B as well as in FOCUS cells that had no apparent deletion or rearrangement of the p53 gene. Immunoprecipitation after [35S]methionine labeling of HCC cells demonstrated that p53 protein was absent in Hep 3B and FOCUS and reduced in concentration in PLC/PRF/5 cells. p53 synthesized by Mahlavu cells showed a slower migration on SDS/polyacrylamide gels suggesting it was an abnormal protein. In Huh7 cells, p53 protein had a prolonged half-life leading to its accumulation in the nuclei; increased levels of p53 protein were also found by immunoblotting. The p53 gene and its expression appeared to be unaltered in the hepatoblastoma-derived Hep G2 cell line. We found that the loss of p53 expression did not occur as a late in vitro event in the FOCUS cell line because p53 protein was also nondetectable at an early passage. We conclude that the loss of p53 expression or the presence of abnormal forms of the protein are frequently associated with HCC cell lines. These observations suggest that alterations in p53 may be important events in the transformation of hepatocytes to the malignant phenotype",

    "Title": "Mutation of the p53 gene in human acute myelogenous leukemia",
    "Abstract": "Heterogeneity of p53 protein expression is seen in blast cells of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). p53 protein is detected in the blasts of certain AML patients but not in others. We have identified p53 protein variants with abnormal mobility on gel electrophoresis and/or prolonged half-life (t 1/2). We have sequenced the p53 coding sequence from primary blast cells of five AML patients and from the AML cell line (OCIM2). In OCIM2, a point mutation in codon 274 was identified that changes a valine residue to aspartic acid. A wild type p53 allele was not detected in these cells. Two point mutations (codon 135, cysteine to serine; codon 246, methionine to valine) were identified in cDNA from blasts of one AML patient. Both mutations were present in blast colonies grown from single blast progenitor cells, indicating that individual leukemia cells had sustained mutation of both p53 alleles. The cDNAs sequenced from blast samples of four other patients, including one with prolonged p53 protein t 1/2 and one with no detectable p53 protein, were fully wild type. Thus, the heterogeneity of p53 expression cannot be explained in all cases by genetic change in the p53 coding sequence. The prolonged t 1/2 of p53 protein seen in some AML blasts may therefore reflect changes not inherent to p53. A model is proposed in which mutational inactivation of p53, although not required for the evolution of neoplasia, would confer a selective advantage, favoring clonal outgrowth during disease progression",

    "Abstract": "A patient with typical Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) was studied during sequential phases of disease: (1) initial chronic phase; (2) myeloid blast crisis; (3) second chronic phase; and (4) accelerated disease. A point mutation in the coding sequence of the p53 gene first appeared concomitantly with the blast crisis and then disappeared with the re-establishment of a second chronic phase. The chromosomal concomitant of the molecular alteration was a deletion of 17p. These observations suggest that abnormalities of the p53 anti-oncogene are temporally related to the clinical progression of some cases of CML and are probably responsible for the development of blast crisis in these cases",

    "Abstract": "p53 is currently considered to be a tumor suppressor gene product, and its alterations are suggested to be involved in several human malignancies. Here we show evidence of the possible involvement of p53 gene mutations in lymphoid leukemias studied by reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and nucleotide sequencing. Fourteen patients with various leukemias were examined and two with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and one with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia were identified to have mutations in the coding region of the p53 gene. These mutations included point mutation, triplet deletion, and single nucleotide insertion. Furthermore, expression of the wild-type p53 mRNA was not detected in the samples from these three patients. In one of them, chromosome 17p was deleted, suggesting the absence of the nonmutated p53 gene, whereas in the other two patients, chromosome 17p seemed to be intact by cytogenetic analysis. Our results suggest that alterations of the p53 gene may have a role in the genesis of some leukemias",

    "Abstract": "We looked for mutations of exons 5 to 8 of the P53 gene in 10 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 17p monosomy, and 36 patients with AML and no cytogenetic abnormalities of 17p. DNA was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and nucleotide sequencing. Four of the 10 patients with 17p monosomy showed point mutation, single-nucleotide deletion, or insertion in exons 7 or 8. By contrast, only 1 of the 36 patients with AML and no cytogenetic abnormalities of 17p showed a mutation of the P53 gene in exons 5 to 8 (P less than .01). These results suggest that alterations of the P53 gene may have a role in leukemogenesis in some cases of AML. The fact that P53 gene mutations occurred more often in patients with 17p monosomy seems to support the 'recessive' model of tumor suppressive activity of the P53 gene rather than the 'dominant' model, in which alteration of only one allele is sufficient for the development of malignancy",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent cancer in sub-Saharan Africa and eastern Asia. Hepatitis B virus and aflatoxins are risk factors for HCC, but the molecular mechanism of human hepatocellular carcinogenesis is largely unknown. Abnormalities in the structure and expression of the tumour-suppressor gene p53 are frequent in HCC cell lines, and allelic losses from chromosome 17p have been found in HCCs from China and Japan. Here we report on allelic deletions from chromosome 17p and mutations of the p53 gene found in 50% of primary HCCs from southern Africa. Four of five mutations detected were G----T substitutions, with clustering at codon 249. This mutation specificity could reflect exposure to a specific carcinogen, one candidate being aflatoxin B1 (ref. 7), a food contaminant in Africa, which is both a mutagen that induces G to T substitution and a liver-specific carcinogen",

Eight of the 16 HCC had a point mutation at the third base position of codon 249. The G----T transversion in seven HCC DNA samples and the G----C transversion in the other HCC are consistent with mutations caused by aflatoxin B1 in mutagenesis experiments. No mutations were found in exons 5,6,8 or the remainder of exon 7. These results contrast with p53 mutations previously reported in carcinomas and sarcomas of human lung, colon, oesophagus and breast; these are primarily scattered over four of the five evolutionarily conserved domains, which include codon 249 (refs 4- 9).

    "Abstract": "Although bladder cancers are very common, little is known about their molecular pathogenesis. In this study, invasive bladder cancers were evaluated for the presence of gene mutations in the p53 suppressor gene. Of 18 tumors evaluated, 11 (61 percent) were found to have genetic alterations of p53. The alterations included ten point mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions, and one 24-base pair deletion. In all but one case, the mutations were associated with chromosome 17p allelic deletions, leaving the cells with only mutant forms of the p53 gene products. Through the use of the polymerase chain reaction and oligomer-specific hybridization, p53 mutations were identified in 1 to 7 percent of the cells within the urine sediment of each of three patients tested. The p53 mutations are the first genetic alterations demonstrated to occur in a high proportion of primary invasive bladder cancers. Detection of such mutations ex vivo has clinical implications for monitoring individuals whose tumor cells are shed extracorporeally",

Results showed that four of them had single-base substitutions and the other two had deletions of one and eight base pairs. Five of the six mutations detected were clustered in highly conserved regions of the p53 gene. The frequency of p53 gene mutations in primary brain tumors examined was 9.8%. We also found two new polymorphic markers in the p53 gene, one in intron 7 and the other in an Alu repeat in exon 11. Both markers could be detected by SSCP analysis. Using these two markers, we found two cases of loss of heterozygosity in other brain tumor specimens.

    "Abstract": "Using a combination of polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism techniques we analyzed 34 ovarian cancer samples (30 primary tumors and four matched metastases) for the presence of mutations in exons 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the p53 gene. Mutations in this portion of the gene are known to lead to the loss of the oncosuppressive potential of p53. Thirty-six percent (11/30) of the ovarian carcinomas tested presented a mutated p53 allele. Mutations were clustered in exons 5 and 7 to the exclusion of the other exons screened. Most mutations (10/11) were point mutations, but no preferential pattern of nucleotide substitution could be observed. In three tumors the mutation of one allele was concomitant with the loss of the wild-type counterpart. Another sample presented both alleles independently mutated. These observations are in agreement with the recessive nature of the p53 mutation. However, analysis of tissue sections from two tumors showed that the portion composed of 100% cancer cells could hold both the mutated and the wild-type form. Moreover analysis of serial sections gave evidence of a heterogeneous cellular content in one of these tumors, suggesting that p53 mutations may, in some cases, occur late during ovarian cancer evolution. It is, moreover, noticeable that, in matched sets of primary tumors and metastases, the same mutation was observed in both tumor samples. Therefore, even as a late event, p53 mutation occurs before metastatic spread",

    "Abstract": "A strategy and methods for archival analysis of genetic and protein alterations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene are presented. The tumor series includes 43 paraffin-embedded esophageal carcinomas from two high-incidence regions in the People's Republic of China. More than half contained elevated p53 protein levels which were detected by a high-titer polyclonal antiserum and a sensitive immunohistochemical method. To estimate the frequency of underlying mutations, DNA was isolated from conventional paraffin sections, amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and examined by dideoxy termination sequencing. Analysis of exons 5-8 in a subset of 10 tumors revealed mis- sense point mutations in 4 out of 5 immunostain-positive tumors and a mutation encoding a stop codon in 1 of 5 immunostain-negative tumors. In this report of archival material, we conclude that detectable levels of p53 protein correlate closely with the occurrence of mis-sense mutations. Furthermore, these methods render large repositories of paraffin-embedded tumor and non-tumor tissues accessible to analysis. Immunohistochemical screening for elevated protein levels followed by sequence analysis represents an efficient strategy for the evaluation of the p53 mutational spectrum",

    "Abstract": "DNAs from ninety seven primary breast carcinoma biopsies have been examined for loss of sequences on 17p13. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis has been carried out on the majority of these cases to determine whether p53 gene expression can be detected. Detection of p53 expression is taken to indicate mutation of p53 leading to stabilisation of the protein and thus detectable levels of p53 in the cell. In 86% of breast carcinoma samples where both allele loss and expression data were available, loss of sequences on 17p13 and/or expression of p53 was detected. Alterations to p53, whether loss of one allele or mutation, are therefore by far the most common changes so far detected in primary human breast tumours. In three cases where expression of p53 could be detected by immunohistochemistry, the precise mutation to p53 was identified. All three mutations fall within the regions which are highly conserved in p53, encoded by exons 5 to 8. Two are single base changes leading to misense mutations, and the third is a single base-pair deletion. The expression of the latter gene would result in production of a truncated protein which should lack normal biological activities",

    "Abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that the p53 oncoprotein might function normally as a tumor suppressor. Mutations in highly conserved regions of the p53 gene have been observed in numerous types of tumors and tumor cell lines. To detect in a more sensitive manner p53 gene mutations in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) we utilized the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique of Orita et al., (1989). Using PCR primers for the most highly conserved regions of the p53 gene, including exons 4-9, we have identified p53 mutations in 5 of 9 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumor DNA samples and in 1 SCLC cell line. None of the mutations seen in tumor DNA samples were present in normal DNA from the same patients, indicating that mutation of the p53 gene in these tumors was a somatic event. Of the six mutations observed, two were found in exon 7, three were found in the region encompassing exons 8 and 9, and one was found in the region encompassing exons 5 and 6. Nucleotide sequencing of one of the exon 7 mutations and one of the exon 8-9 mutations indicated that each was a C to T transition. In SCLC-6 the mutation resulted in substitution of serine for proline at amino acid 278 and in SCLC-4 substitution of tryptophan for arginine at amino acid 248, both nonconservative amino acid substitutions. Both of these changes are in regions of the p53 gene where mutations have been observed in other tumors. Two additional mutations were observed in SCLC cell lines using conventional PCR techniques. One of these is a mutation which results in altered splicing of the p53 pre-mRNA",

    "Abstract": "The p53 gene has been implicated as a tumour suppressor, with mutations occurring in many carcinomas, such as colon, breast and lung. We have sequenced exons 5, 7 and 8 containing conserved gene regions in the only available differentiated thyroid follicular carcinoma cell line and found a mutation at position 273, Arg----His, with no normal allele present. The same mutation was also present in DNA from the tumour of origin. However immunohistochemical analysis of 129 human thyroid tumours using a panel of p53 antibodies was unequivocally negative. Southern blotting in 20 cases failed to demonstrate any deletion or rearrangement, and direct genomic sequencing of 20 carcinomas showed normal DNA sequence for exons 5, 7 and 8. Thus p53 abnormalities may not be important in human thyroid carcinogenesis, in contrast to colon, breast and lung. However, the FTC 133 cell line was only established after 132 unsuccessful attempts with other differentiated thyroid follicular tumours. Since this line and the corresponding tumour of origin have a p53 mutation, we propose that p53 mutation may confer on thyroid follicular tumour cells the ability to grow in culture. This has potential applications for the future development of thyroid carcinoma cell lines",

Mutations changing the p53 coding sequence were found in 11 of 15 patients (73.3%) and showed a similar but distinct nucleotide substitution pattern compared with NSCLC, suggesting that a different mutagenic process is involved. In addition, a strong correlation was seen between the presence of p53 mutations in tumors and the successful establishment of the corresponding cell lines, suggesting that p53 mutations can confer a selective growth advantage in vitro (and probably also in vivo)",

    "Abstract": "Twenty-four colorectal tumors and their paired mucosa were examined for allele loss on chromosomes 5 and 17, using polymerase chain reaction- amplified DNA, and for mutations in the Ki-ras and p53 genes. In addition, 19 benign polyps were analysed for mutations in the p53 gene. RFLP analysis of the long arm of chromosome 5 indicated an allele loss frequency of 47% for malignant tumors, a value somewhat higher than previously observed. Examination of the short arm of chromosome 17 indicated an allele loss of 60%. Sequence analysis of the p53 gene in colorectal tumors indicated that 64% contained a mutation. All tumors showing allele loss on chromosome 17 were mutant for p53, suggesting that mutation of one p53 allele precedes the hemizygotic loss of the wild-type allele. Sequence analysis of the p53 gene in 19 benign polyps, devoid of severe dysplasia, did not reveal any mutants, suggesting that the mutation of one p53 allele is an event that takes place after polyp formation. Ki-ras mutations were observed in 48% of the tumors examined. All tumors which were mutant for Ki-ras, except for one, were also mutant for p53",

    "Abstract": "Genomic DNA was extracted from archival pathology specimens comprising 10 squamous and 14 adenocarcinomas, including 7 with Barrett's epithelium adjacent to tumor, and corresponding normal esophagus from the resection margin. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify selected exons of p53 which were analyzed for mutations using single- strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Mutations were localized to exon 8 for 1 adenocarcinoma and to exon 5 for 1 squamous tumor and 4 of 7 Barrett's specimens. Sequencing confirmed mutations at codons 273 (CGT----CAT; adenocarcinoma) and 176 (TGC----TTC; squamous) and in Barrett's epithelium at codons 152 (CCG----CTG), 155 (ACC----GCC) and 175 (CGC----CAC). Specimens of Barrett's epithelium from separate sites had identical p53 mutations suggesting a clonal origin. Cancers arising in mutant epithelium did not have mutations corresponding to those found in the Barrett's specimens suggesting that other events are required for tumorigenesis",

    "Title": "Aberrations of the tumor suppressor p53 and retinoblastoma genes in human hepatocellular carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Aberrations of the p53 gene in 43 primary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) were examined by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction products. Of these hepatocellular carcinomas, 22 were advanced HCCs, and 21 were early HCCs. Structural abnormalities of the p53 gene were observed in eight of the 22 advanced HCCs, but in none of the early HCCs. Of the eight tumors with an abnormal p53 gene, seven had lost one of the two p53 alleles and, in the seven tumors with identifiable mutations, point mutations were found in four tumors and deletions of several nucleotides were observed in two tumors. The remaining one retained both alleles and carried two point mutations. In addition to the aberrations of the p53 gene, loss of the retinoblastoma gene or loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 13q was observed in six of seven informative cases of eight tumors carrying a mutated p53 gene. These results suggest the involvement of at least two tumor suppressor genes in a late stage of hepatocarcinogenesis",

    "Abstract": "Aberrations of the p53 gene and its transcript in ten human tumor- derived cell lines were investigated by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction products. This method can detect loss of one of the two alleles and a point mutation in the remaining allele simultaneously. Aberrations were newly found in four tumor cell lines. Three cell lines had lost one of the alleles and had a point mutation in the other. These point mutations, resulting in amino acid substitutions, were in the region of the p53 gene, which is highly conserved in different species. All the mutated genes were expressed and produced mRNAs with point mutations. One cell line did not contain any detectable transcript of the p53 gene, although no structural aberration of the gene was detected in the regions analyzed. Most of the cell lines found to carry aberrations of the p53 gene in this work have previously been reported to have mutations in oncogenes or in a tumor suppressor gene other than the p53 gene. These results provide additional examples of multiple genetic changes in the genesis of human tumors",

These mutated genes also cooperate in the immortalization and neoplastic transformation of rodent cells. To determine whether these mutations are necessary for maintenance of the immortalized and/or neoplastically transformed states of human bronchial epithelial cells, the p53 gene and regions of the ras (K-, H-, and N-) genes were sequenced in nine human lung carcinoma cell lines. Detection of p53 mutations by polymerase chain amplification and direct DNA sequencing was corroborated by p53 immunocytochemistry and coimmunoprecipitation of p53 with heat shock protein 70. p53 and ras genes were frequently, but not always, mutated in the carcinoma cell lines. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that multiple genetic changes involving both protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes occur during lung carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Genetic analysis of human esophageal tumors from two high incidence geographic areas: frequent p53 base substitutions and absence of ras mutations",
    "Abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESC) samples from patients residing in Uruguay and in Normandy, France, where alcoholic beverages and tobacco smoke are major risk factors, were analyzed for point mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Among 34 tumors (15 from Normandy and 19 from Uruguay) 15 point mutations in the p53 gene that result in amino acid substitutions or chain termination were identified by polymerase chain reaction amplification of exons 5-8 and direct DNA sequencing. Base substitutions in ESC from these high-incidence areas are dispersed over the midregion of the p53 gene. There are differences between ESC and other types of gastrointestinal cancer in the nature of frequent base substitutions. CpG to TpG transitions were far less prevalent in these ESC than in colorectal tumors, whereas G to T transversions, rarely found in colon cancers, were found in one-fourth of the ESC samples. Base substitutions at A:T pairs constitute an important fraction of ESC p53 mutations, in contrast to mutation patterns in most other types of solid tumors. In contrast to the frequent mutation of the p53 gene in these samples, no mutations in the H-, K-, or N-ras genes were found in 16 tumors from Uruguay by direct sequencing of exons in which transforming mutations are known to occur. A previous study on ras mutations in ESC from France was also negative (M. C. Hollstein et al., Cancer Res., 48: 5119-5123, 1988). The role of distinct etiological factors in generating these differences and the potential for linking patient exposure histories with patterns of p53 mutations in high risk populations are considered",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 gene were investigated after tumor cell enrichment by cell sorting based on differences in DNA content and polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis in 24 surgical specimens of primary gastric cancer. p53 mutations were detected in exons 4-8 in 64% (9 of 14) of aneuploid tumors but in none of 10 diploid tumors examined. Four of five tumors containing two or three aneuploid subpopulations showed the presence of p53 gene mutations. No correlation was found between the presence of p53 mutations and the degree of histological differentiation of tumors. These findings suggest that p53 gene mutations are related to DNA ploidy alterations as relatively late events of carcinogenesis in gastric cancer. The present method is highly sensitive for detection of genetic abnormalities and is applicable even when various kinds of nontumorous cells are present in tumor samples",

    "Abstract": "The p53 gene has been elucidated as a tumor suppressor gene, and inactivation of this gene caused by deletion or point mutations may play a crucial role in the development of human malignancies. In colorectal carcinomas with an allelic deletion of the p53 gene, the remaining p53 gene was mutated with considerable frequency. It is most difficult to detect point mutations or small deletions of the gene because the mutations occur in diverse regions, although four hot spots have been observed [J.M. Nigro et al., Nature (Lond.), 342: 705-708, 1989]. The polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis facilitate detection of mutations in the hot spots of the p53 gene. Using these methods, we detected mutations in three adenomatous polyps and one carcinoma from familial polyposis coli patients and three carcinomas of sporadic cases. The DNA sequence analysis confirmed mutations of the p53 gene in 2 adenomas (13 base- pair deletions in one and a point mutation in the other) and 1 carcinoma (point mutation) from familial polyposis coli patients. These results suggest that the p53 gene mutations may be involved in the formation not only of carcinomas but also of adenomas which occur in familial polyposis coli patients",

    "Title": "Maintenance of p53 alterations throughout breast cancer progression",
    "Abstract": "Overexpression of the nuclear phosphoprotein p53 is one of the most common abnormalities in primary human cancer and appears to be due to point mutation within a highly conserved region of the p53 gene which then encodes for a mutant, more stable protein. In this study different stages of breast cancer progression were examined, from in situ to metastatic disease, to determine at what stage mutational activation occurs and whether it is maintained during tumor progression. Two (13%) of 15 pure intraductal tumors expressed high levels of p53 in all malignant epithelial cells. Sequencing of p53 mRNA from one of these tumors demonstrated a nucleotide substitution altering the amino acid composition of the protein. Six (17%) of 35 specimens which contained both in situ and invasive disease expressed high levels of p53. All malignant epithelial cells in these 6 cases stained positively and in no specimen did one component express different levels of the protein than the other growth phase. Sequence analysis of a tissue with significant amounts of both in situ and invasive disease revealed only a single point mutation, without evidence of wild-type nucleotide at the site of substitution, suggesting that p53 mRNA from each component of the tumor contained the same nucleotide substitution. Eleven (50%) of 22 pairs of primary tumors and their lymph node metastases expressed elevated levels of p53, and in each case, expression levels were identical in the primary and secondary sites. Identical mutations were found in the p53 mRNA from two paired primary and metastatic sites. Therefore, mutation within a highly conserved region of the p53 gene leading to overexpression of the protein product can occur in the earliest recognized phase of breast cancer and this alteration is maintained during progression from intraductal to infiltrating carcinoma. Mutations are also conserved during the process of metastatic spread",

The p53 gene was abnormal in three of six sarcomas studied. Retinoblastoma gene analysis was performed by Western immunoblot; retinoblastoma protein was under-phosphorylated in three of seven tumors and absent in one other. In all, six of seven radiation-induced human tumors have abnormalities of one or both suppressor genes.

Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of genomic DNA and complementary DNA proved more sensitive in the detection of mutations. Combining this technique with the other two a total of 12 mutations in the p53 gene were demonstrated in 11 tumors (46%), and a polymorphism at codon 213 was detected in another tumor. Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17p was detected by Southern blot analysis in 30% of the tumor DNAs.

    "Abstract": "Evidence supporting a broad role for the inactivation of the p53 gene in human tumorigenesis has been provided by studies showing that the p53 gene is mutated in many human cancers. In this study, we report on the mutational status of the p53 gene in prostate cancer cells and provide functional evidence that the wild-type p53 gene may have a role in suppressing prostatic tumorigenesis. Sequence analysis of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene reveals that three of five prostate cancer cell lines (TSUPr-1, PC3, DU145) contain mutations which alter the amino acid sequence of this most highly conserved portion of the gene. One of two primary prostatic cancer specimens examined also contained a mutation in this region. Transfection of the wild-type p53 gene versus a mutated p53 gene into two cell lines with p53 mutations results in reduced colony formation. Wild-type p53 gene expression is apparently incompatible with continued growth of these tumor cells inasmuch as none of the colonies which formed after wild-type transfections retain the transfected p53 sequences. Immunocytochemical data indicate that prostate carcinoma cells expressing the transfected wild-type p53 gene are growth arrested because they exhibit a reduced level of thymidine incorporation into DNA. This study is the first report of p53 gene mutations in prostate cancer cells and suggests a functional role for the p53 gene in suppressing prostatic tumorigenesis",

    "Abstract": "A putative tumor suppressor gene, p53, has been shown to be altered in a variety of human tumor types. The primary mechanism of p53 inactivation is believed to be mutation of one allele followed by loss of the second allele. Malignant mesothelioma is a tumor that has been highly associated with exposure to asbestos fibers, which are known to cause chromosomal abnormalities in mesothelial cells. We have examined four mesothelioma cell lines for genetic abnormalities in p53. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that two of the four tumors had abnormalities (numerical and/or structural) of chromosome 17 (the locus of the p53 gene). Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using a chromosome 17p-specific probe (pYNZ22) revealed that two tumors had loss of heterozygosity in the region of 17p13. The relative level of p53 mRNA expression was examined by Northern analysis, with one tumor showing negligible expression of p53 mRNA. The complementary DNA of p53 was generated from the three tumors showing detectable mRNA expression, and the region between codons 70 and 319 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. DNA single-base substitutions were detected in two of the tumor cell lines, each resulting in amino acid substitutions. One tumor had an arginine to histidine substitution at position 175, and one tumor had a glycine to aspartic acid substitution at position 245. The observed mutations took place in regions of high cross-species sequence homology, indicating that these regions may be functionally important. The correlation of chromosomal loss in 17p on the cytogenetic and molecular level along with p53 mRNA expression and DNA sequence data indicate that genetic alterations in p53 could be a feature of malignant mesotheliomas and may reveal an important role of asbestos fibers in tumor suppressor gene inactivation",

LOH was observed at 27 loci on 10 different chromosomes, i.e., chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, and 21, but was not detected at loci on chromosomes 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, and X. It was observed only in seven of 24 cases, and the other 19 cases did not show LOH at any loci examined, including five cases of tumors with a high proportion of adenomatous hyperplasia. Among seven tumors with LOH at one or more loci, five tumors showed LOH at loci on the short arm of chromosome 17. Furthermore, mutations of the p53 gene, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 17, were detected in three of these 24 tumors by a polymerase chain reaction- single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and subsequent DNA sequencing. In two of these three tumors, p53 mutations were accompanied by the loss of wild-type p53 alleles. These results suggest that inactivation of the p53 gene is involved in the development of EC as in the case of several other types of human cancers",

Two of the four gastric cancer metastases and four of the eight cell lines originally established from gastric cancer metastases were found to have p53 gene alterations in the exon 5 to 11 region; point mutations and amino acid replacements were detected in a liver and an ovary metastasis at exon 7, in the TMK1 and MKN1 cell lines at exon 5, and in the OKAJIMA cell line at exon 10. The normal allele was not found in these cell lines. In the KATO-III cell line, gross deletion and rearrangement of the p53 gene were noted. However, no p53 mutations were identified in 19 primary lesions of gastric cancer, suggesting that the p53 gene abnormality preferentially occurs in the advanced stages of gastric cancer. In contrast to the gastric cancer, none of the 13 esophageal cancer cell lines, including two cell lines established from metastases, and none of the four cervical cancer cell lines showed any aberration in exons 5 to 11 of the p53 gene. During the course of the study, a novel polymorphism in intron 7 of the p53 gene was found, which can be recognized by restriction enzyme digestions of the polymerase chain reaction product",

Of the seven cervical carcinoma cell lines, two (HT-3 and C-33A) contained p53 codon changes as well. We were unable to detect human papillomavirus in these two cell lines. By contrast, five human papillomavirus-positive cervical carcinoma cell lines (HeLa S-3, Caski, SiHa, C-4I, and ME-180) contained wild-type p53 gene sequences. We suggest that, in the human papillomavirus-positive cervical tumors, p53 inactivation occurred via the known mechanism of viral E6/cellular p53 protein association, whereas in all other tumors p53 function was compromised by changes in the amino acid sequence",

    "Title": "Participation of p53 protein in the cellular response to DNA damage",
    "Abstract": "The inhibition of replicative DNA synthesis that follows DNA damage may be critical for avoiding genetic lesions that could contribute to cellular transformation. Exposure of ML-1 myeloblastic leukemia cells to nonlethal doses of the DNA damaging agents, gamma-irradiation or actinomycin D, causes a transient inhibition of replicative DNA synthesis via both G1 and G2 arrests. Levels of p53 protein in ML-1 cells and in proliferating normal bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells increase and decrease in temporal association with the G1 arrest. In contrast, the S-phase arrest of ML-1 cells caused by exposure to the anti-metabolite, cytosine arabinoside, which does not directly damage DNA, is not associated with a significant change in p53 protein levels. Caffeine treatment blocks both the G1 arrest and the induction of p53 protein after gamma-irradiation, thus suggesting that blocking the induction of p53 protein may contribute to the previously observed effects of caffeine on cell cycle changes after DNA damage. Unlike ML-1 cells and normal bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells, hematopoietic cells that either lack p53 gene expression or overexpress a mutant form of the p53 gene do not exhibit a G1 arrest after gamma-irradiation; however, the G2 arrest is unaffected by the status of the p53 gene. These results suggest a role for the wild-type p53 protein in the inhibition of DNA synthesis that follows DNA damage and thus suggest a new mechanism for how the loss of wild-type p53 might contribute to tumorigenesis",

    "Abstract": "The tumour suppressor gene p53 has been found to be mutated or inactivated at high frequency in several common human tumours. We have examined a series of exocrine pancreatic carcinomas for over-expression of mutant forms of p53 by immunohistochemistry with a panel of specific antibodies. We found immunodetectable p53 in 13 of 22 (60%) frozen pancreatic cancers and seven of 13 pancreatic cell lines. One of the antibodies, CM1, recognises p53 in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival material and using this reagent we found immunodetectable p53 in 28 of 124 (23%) pancreatic cancers. We have successfully demonstrated the presence of point mutations by direct sequencing of genomic DNA extracted from archival tissue showing CM1 immunoreactivity. We conclude that p53 activation is an important event in human pancreatic tumorigenesis and that the CM1 antibody can detect a proportion of cases of overexpression of mutant p53 in archival pathological material",

    "Abstract": "Experiments were undertaken to investigate a genetic event involved in leukemogenesis in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). For this purpose, the p53 gene was chosen for study, since alteration of the gene has been found in a wide variety of human cancers. Structures and expression of the p53 gene in ATL cells were investigated by Southern and Northern blot analyses and a polymerase-chain-reaction single-strand conformation-polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. Either subtle alterations of the p53 gene or the absence of detectable level of p53 mRNA were found in 2 of 3 acute ATL cell lines and 2 of 12 acute ATL fresh samples. In contrast, no mutation was detected in 4 cases with less aggressive types of ATL (3 chronic and 1 smoldering ATL cases). Mutations found in acute ATL cells occurred in regions highly conserved in evolution and all the cells carrying p53 mutation showed loss of the other p53 allele. These results suggests that alteration of the p53 gene may contribute to progression of the disease in some cases of ATL",

    "Title": "Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene in human cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "In this study, we analyzed 10 human squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) for alterations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene in exons 4 through 9 by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. We found that 2 of 10 SCCs displayed unusual SSCP alleles at exon 7 of the p53 gene. Subsequent cloning and sequencing of PCR-amplified exon 7 DNA from these two tumors revealed that one had a G----A transition at the first position of codon 244, predicting a glycine-to-serine amino acid change, while the other tumor exhibited a G----T base change at the second nucleotide of codon 248, predicting an arginine-to-leucine substitution. Because the mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene in both tumors were located opposite potential pyrimidine dimer sites (C- C), it is consistent with these mutations having been induced by the ultraviolet radiation present in sunlight. These studies demonstrate that inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, as well as activation of ras oncogenes, may be involved in the pathogenesis of some human skin cancers",

    "Title": "The spectrum of molecular alterations in the evolution of chronic myelocytic leukemia",
    "Abstract": "DNA from 135 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) at various clinical stages and Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia was investigated for alterations in a variety of proto-oncogenes which have been implicated in the evolution of CML from its chronic phase to blast crisis. The most common genetic change found in the evolution of typical Ph1 chromosome positive CML to blast crisis was an alteration of the p53 gene involving either a rearrangement, a deletion, or a point mutation in the coding sequence of the gene. Alterations of the p53 gene were found in the myeloid and the rare megakaryocytic variant of blast crisis but were absent in the lymphoid leukemic transformants. Gross structural alterations were seen in 11 of 54 (20%) of myeloid or unknown phenotypes of blast crisis and in only 1 of 44 chronic phase cases. Eight examples of mutations in the open reading frame of the p53 gene at codons 49, 53, 60, 140, 202, 204, 238, and 239 were observed in blast crisis patients. Mutations in the N- RAS gene were rare in typical blast crisis (2 of 27 cases) but were found in megakaryocytic and Ph1 negative myeloid blast crisis. We concluded that heterogeneous alterations in the p53 gene and occasionally in the N-RAS genes accompany the evolution of chronic phase CML to blast crisis",

Mutations were present in two of 12 ATL patients studied, but not in 3 cell lines immortalized by human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection in vitro. Direct sequencing analysis of the p53 gene from these two patients revealed missense point mutations at codon 153 (arginine to histidine) or codon 220 (cysteine to tyrosine), respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the elevated expression of p53 proteins in ATL cells from a patient carrying the mutated p53 gene at codon 158. Neither gross rearrangement of p53 gene nor abnormal size of mRNA for the gene was demonstrated by Southern or Northern blot analyses. Thus, there is a mutated p53 in some patients with ATL. The involvement of abnormalities in some suppressor oncogenes may play a role in the development of ATL",

    "Title": "Occurrence of p53 gene abnormalities in gastric carcinoma tumors and cell lines",
    "Abstract": "We explored the state of the p53 gene in gastric cancer. Using one or more methods, we examined 15 specimens from primary carcinomas (14 tumors, one cell line), five cell lines derived from metastases, and seven paired samples of nonmalignant gastric mucosa. Sequence analyses of complementary DNA containing the entire p53 gene open reading frame demonstrated abnormalities in one of five samples from primary tumors and in all five samples from metastases. The single cell line derived from a primary carcinoma had no abnormality of the gene. The six abnormalities included four point mutations, one base-pair deletion resulting in a frame shift, and a 24 base-pair deletion caused by an intronic point mutation (as determined by sequence analysis of genomic DNA). Four of the six mutations mapped to regions highly conserved among species or involved in simian virus 40 T-antigen binding. Restriction fragment length polymorphism studies confirmed that chromosome 17p allelic deletions occur only in a minority of primary tumors, but that they may occur more frequently in metastases. Northern blotting and ribonuclease protection assays detected only a fraction of the p53 gene abnormalities detected by sequencing. Our findings indicate that mutations of the p53 gene are relatively rare in primary gastric tumors but appear to be relatively frequent in cell lines derived from metastatic lesions. Our results may help in understanding the molecular events associated with progression and metastasis in gastric carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "A new technique for characterizing somatic mutations in very small samples of cellularly heterogeneous human cancer tissue was developed and tested using mutations in the p53 gene in breast carcinomas as a model system. The technique combines touch preparation of specimens to obtain homogeneous clusters of carcinoma cells free of normal cells with a nested pair of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications of DNA to increase the amount of target gene sequence sufficiently to permit direct sequencing of the p53 gene. Touch preparations of fresh or previously frozen tissue from human adenocarcinomas derived from several organs were stained, and clusters of 10-50 malignant cells were transferred by pipette into microfuge tubes for PCR amplification. Exons 5-9 of the p53 gene, which contain the major mutational hot spots associated with most human cancers, were sequenced by the following steps: 1) two rounds of PCR amplification using DNA Taq polymerase and two sets of oligonucleotide primers, the second set being nested within the segment amplified by the first set and having attached T7 and SP6 phage promoter sequences, 2) transcription of the amplified DNA sequences with T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases, and 3) dideoxy sequencing of single-stranded RNA transcripts with reverse transcriptase and with additional oligonucleotide primers to achieve specificity for this unique region of the genome. The utility of this approach is illustrated by our success in detecting and analyzing point mutations in cell clusters from four of 11 primary adenocarcinomas of the human breast",

One sample [human colon cancer (HCC) 278] was found to have a TP53 mutation altering the amino acid glutamine 167 in exon 5. A deletion of 2 bases changed glutamine 167 (CAG) to alanine (GCA) and the resulting frame-shift produced an in-frame stop codon at amino acid 179.

    "Abstract": "Astrocytomas, including the most malignant form, glioblastoma multiforme, are the most frequent and deadly primary tumors of the human nervous system. Recent molecular genetic analyses of astrocytomas have demonstrated frequent chromosome 17 deletions involving the telomeric region of the short arm (17p12-pter). This region contains a candidate tumor suppressor gene, TP53, which has recently been implicated in the etiology of a broad array of human cancers. To study the possible role of TP53 in astrocytoma development, 24 randomly chosen human astrocytic tumors were examined for genomic TP53 sequence aberrations using primer-directed DNA amplification in conjunction with direct sequencing. Five of the 11 grade III astrocytomas (glioblastoma multiforme), but only one of seven grade II astrocytomas (anaplastic astrocytoma) and none of either the grade I astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas demonstrated distinct point mutations involving the TP53 gene. These data suggest that TP53 mutations may play a role in astrocytoma development and are predominantly associated with higher grade tumors",

    "Abstract": "We have investigated the frequency of p53 mutations in B- and T-cell human lymphoid malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the major subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. p53 exons 5-9 were studied by using genomic DNA from 197 primary tumors and 27 cell lines by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments. Mutations were found associated with (i) Burkitt lymphoma (9/27 biopsies; 17/27 cell lines) and its leukemic counterpart L3-type B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (5/9), both of which also carry activated c-myc oncogenes, and (ii) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (6/40) and, in particular, its stage of progression known as Richter's transformation (3/7). Mutations were not found at any significant frequency in other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In many cases, only the mutated allele was detectable, implying loss of the normal allele. These results suggest that (i) significant differences in the frequency of p53 mutations are present among subtypes of neoplasms derived from the same tissue; (ii) p53 may play a role in tumor progression in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia; (iii) the presence of both p53 loss/inactivation and c-myc oncogene activation may be important in the pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma and its leukemic form L3-type B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia",

    "Abstract": "Human cervical carcinoma cell lines that were either positive or negative for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences were analyzed for evidence of mutation of the p53 and retinoblastoma genes. Each of five HPV-positive cervical cancer cell lines expressed normal pRB and low levels of wild-type p53 proteins, which are presumed to be altered in function as a consequence of association with HPV E7 and E6 oncoproteins, respectively. In contrast, mutations were identified in the p53 and RB genes expressed in the C-33A and HT-3 cervical cancer cell lines, which lack HPV DNA sequences. Mutations in the p53 genes mapped to codon 273 and codon 245 in the C33-A and HT-3 cell lines, respectively, located in the highly conserved regions of p53, where mutations appear in a variety of human cancers. Mutations in RB occurred at splice junctions, resulting in in-frame deletions, affecting exons 13 and 20 in the HT-3 and C-33A cell lines, respectively. These mutations resulted in aberrant proteins that were not phosphorylated and were unable to complex with the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein. These results support the hypothesis that the inactivation of the normal functions of the tumor-suppressor proteins pRB and p53 are important steps in human cervical carcinogenesis, either by mutation or from complex formation with the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins",

    "Abstract": "All patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) undergo clinical transition from chronic to acute phase. This transition is often associated with deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 in the form of the i(17q) aberration. Since the p53 gene is a suppressor gene and is located on 17p13, we examined the possibility that it is inactivated during progression of CML. Therefore, we studied the structure and expression of p53 in the leukemic cells of a large number of CML patients in acute phase. We found that although the gene is rarely rearranged, one p53 allele is completely deleted in patients with the i(17q) aberration as well as in some patients who do not show karyotypic changes. In all of these patients the remaining allele is inactivated through loss of expression, rearrangement, or point mutation. Detailed analysis of some patients who carry both p53 alleles indicated neither loss of expression nor structural alterations. It appears that p53 loss of function is associated with progression of around 25% of CML patients",

    "Abstract": "Sunlight is a carcinogen to which everyone is exposed. Its UV component is the major epidemiologic risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Of the multiple steps in tumor progression, those that are sunlight-related would be revealed if they contained mutations specific to UV. In a series of New England and Swedish patients, we find that 14/24 (58%) of invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the skin contain mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, each altering the amino acid sequence. Involvement of UV light in these p53 mutations is indicated by the presence in three of the tumors of a CC----TT double- base change, which is only known to be induced by UV. UV is also implicated by a UV-like occurrence of mutations exclusively at dipyrimidine sites, including a high frequency of C----T substitutions. p53 mutations in internal malignancies do not show these UV-specific mutations. The dipyrimidine specificity also implicates dipyrimidine photoproducts containing cytosine as oncogenic photoproducts. We believe these results identify a carcinogen-related step in a gene involved in the subsequent human cancer",

    "Abstract": "At present, mutation of the p53 gene appears to be the most common genetic alteration found in human cancers. These mutations can occur within many different regions of the gene. We have developed a modification of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis termed 'constant denaturant gel electrophoresis' (CDGE), which provides a rapid and sensitive method to screen the four conserved regions within the p53 gene where the majority of p53 mutations have been reported. The sensitivity of CDGE was first tested with known p53 mutations in all four conserved regions. The CDGE technique was then used to screen 32 breast carcinomas that had been analyzed by immunohistochemical methods for altered p53 protein levels and whose DNA had already been shown to have loss of heterozygosity for a chromosome 17p marker. By immunostaining techniques, only 6 of the 32 tumors had elevated p53 expression. However, CDGE detected p53 mutations in 11 of the 32 tumors. DNA sequence analysis was performed to determine the nucleotide positions of these mutations in all 11 samples. Loss of heterozygosity for the pYNZ22 or p144D6 markers did not associate with either the loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus or the mutations detected by CDGE. We conclude that CDGE is a rapid and effective technique to screen for p53 mutations",

    "Abstract": "Overexpression of an activated form of the p53 protein may be involved in neoplastic transformation.  We found widespread overexpression of p53 by immunohistochemical staining in 11 (22%) of 49 primary invasive human breast cancers.  Northern blot analysis showed that this overexpression was not due to an increase in the steady-state level of p53 mRNA.  The p53 gene was directly sequenced in 7 of these tumors with elevated levels of the protein and, in each case, a mutation that latered the coding sequence for p53 was found in a highly conserved region of the gene.  Whereas 4 of the tumors contained only a mutant p53 allele, the other 3 tumors exhibited coding sequences from both a mutant and a wild-type allele.  p53 mutation have previously bene correlated with allelic loss of part of chromosome 17p that contains the p53 locus.  Examination of all 49 breast tumors revealed a 61% frequency of deletion at or near the p53 locus.  However the presence of allelic deletion did not correlate with overexpression of the protein,.  Six tumors that were deleted but did not express high level of the protein were sequenced and all retained a wild-thype p53 allele.  In this series of human breast cancers, overexpression of the p53 protein, not allelic loss on chromosome 17p, was always associated with mutation in the p53 gene.",

    "Title": "Loss of heterozygosity on the short arm of chromosome 17 is associated with high proliferative capacity and DNA aneuploidy in primary human breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p) was found in 27 of 52 (52%) previously untreated primary breast cancers. There was a significant correlation between this 17p allelic loss and two parameters associated with aggressive tumor behavior: high cellular proliferative fraction and DNA aneuploidy. These correlations with high cellular proliferative fraction and DNA aneuploidy were not found in tumors with LOH at nine other chromosome locations. The p53 gene, a putative tumor suppressor gene located at 17p13, was examined for aberrations to determine whether it is the target for the 17p LOH in breast cancer. Unlike other types of human cancer, there were no homozygous deletions or rearrangements of the p53 gene, and only 2 of 13 (15%) were mutated in the conserved region where mutational 'hot spots' have been previously located. Therefore, we hypothesize that, in breast cancer, either loss or inactivation of gene(s) on chromosome 17p other than the p53 gene or a different mechanism of p53 gene inactivation may be responsible for the observed high labeling index and DNA aneuploidy associated with LOH at 17p",

    "Abstract": "Based on the high incidence of loss of heterozygosity for loci on chromosome 17p in the vicinity of the p53 locus in human breast tumors, we investigated the frequency and effects of mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene in mammary neoplasia. We examined the p53 gene in 20 breast cancer cell lines and 59 primary breast tumors. Northern blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, and nucleotide sequencing analysis revealed aberrant mRNA expression, over-expression of protein, and point mutations in the p53 gene in 50% of the cell lines tested. A multiplex PCR assay was developed to search for deletions in the p53 genomic locus. Multiplex PCR of genomic DNA showed that up to 36% of primary tumors contained aberrations in the p53 locus. Mutations in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene were found in 10 out of 59 (17%) of the primary tumors studies by single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis. We conclude that, compared to amplification of HER2/NEU, MYC, or INT2 oncogene loci, p53 gene mutations and deletions are the most frequently observed genetic change in breast cancer related to a single gene.

    "Title": "Timing and role of p53 gene mutation in the recurrence of glioma",
    "Abstract": "Recently a 17p deletion and p53 gene mutations were reported in human gliomas, but the relationship of the timing of p53 gene mutation and oncogenesis of glioma is still obscure. We examined eight pairs of primary and recurrent gliomas. Four of eight had a histological malignant transformation. In the group with malignant transformation, three out of four pairs had a mutation in the p53 gene only in recurrence. None of the mutations in either primary or recurrent glioma was detected in the group with no histological change. All point mutations occurred within the evolutionarily conserved regions. This suggests that the p53 mutations occurred during the progression and were important in the malignant transformation in the some kinds of gliomas",

    "Abstract": "Loss of cell cycle control and acquisition of chromosomal rearrangements such as gene amplification often occur during tumor progression, suggesting that they may be correlated. We show here that the wild-type p53 allele is lost when fibroblasts from patients with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) are passaged in vitro. Normal and LFS cells containing wild-type p53 arrested in G1 when challenged with the uridine biosynthesis inhibitor PALA and did not undergo PALA-selected gene amplification. The converse occurred in cells lacking wild-type p53 expression. Expression of wild-type p53 in transformants of immortal and tumor cells containing mutant p53 alleles restored G1 control and reduced the frequency of gene amplification to undetectable levels. These studies reveal that p53 contributes to a metabolically regulated G1 check-point, and they provide a model for understanding how abnormal cell cycle progression leads to the genetic rearrangements involved in tumor progression",

    "Abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor gene was examined by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA from fresh tumor cells of 10 patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Samples included nine patients with acute or lymphomatous ATL, and one patient in whom samples were examined in both his acute and chronic stages of ATL. Four missense mutations and one silent point mutation in the coding region of the p53 gene were found in cells from five patients with either acute or lymphomatous ATL. The missense mutations were homozygous and occurred in evolutionarily highly conserved regions of p53. One patient had no p53 mutation in his leukemic cells during chronic phase of ATL, but had a homozygous point mutation at codon 273 (Arg to His) when he progressed to acute ATL. In summary, we show that p53 is frequently mutated in the acute phase of ATL and one informative case suggests that p53 mutations may be associated with the transition from chronic to acute ATL",

    "Title": "Structural and functional analysis of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma shows frequent p53 mutations",
    "Abstract": "The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is capable of inducing adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). However, the long latency period between infection and development of ATLL, as well as the small fraction of the infected population that actually develops this disease, suggest that additional factors are involved in its pathogenesis. Therefore, we performed a molecular analysis of 10 cases of ATLL presenting in a nonendemic area that were shown to have HTLV-I sequences by polymerase chain reaction as well as clonal T-cell receptor beta gene rearrangements. We analyzed these cases for alterations in some of the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes frequently involved in hematopoietic neoplasia. Specifically, we used a single-strand conformation polymorphism assay to determine the presence of mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, as well as the K-RAS, N- RAS, H-RAS, and c-myc oncogenes. In addition, we studied the c-myc gene for rearrangements by Southern blotting and assessed expression of the retinoblastoma (Rb) and p53 genes by immunostaining. Analysis of the c- myc gene and the RAS family of oncogenes did not show any alterations. Also, the Rb gene was expressed in all cases analyzed. However, we found mutations of the p53 gene in 3 of the 10 cases and these results were confirmed by sequence analysis. In two of these cases, we showed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of chromosome 17p sequences that the p53 mutations were accompanied by a loss of heterozygocity. Also, these mutations correlated with an altered pattern of p53 expression. Thus, mutations in the p53 locus may be a cofactor for the development of ATLL in some cases, whereas the c-myc, Rb, and RAS genes do not appear to be involved in these neoplasms",

    "Title": "Frequent mutations in the p53 gene in human myeloid leukemia cell lines",
    "Abstract": "The p53 gene is currently considered to function as a tumor-suppressor gene in various human malignancies. In hematologic malignancies, alterations in the p53 gene have been shown in some human leukemias and lymphomas. Although mutations in the p53 gene are infrequent in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients, we show in this report that alterations in the p53 gene are frequent in myeloid leukemia cell lines. We studied alterations of the p53 gene in nine human myeloid leukemia cell lines by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, and direct sequencing. Expression of the p53 gene was not detected at all by RT-PCR in two of the nine cell lines. In these two cell lines, Southern blot analysis showed gross rearrangements and deletions in both of the p53 alleles. Six of the nine cell lines were found to express only mutant p53 mRNA by RT-PCR/SSCP analysis and direct sequencing, and wild-type p53 mRNA was not detected. Two of the mutant p53 mRNAs were shown to be products of abnormal splicing events induced by intronic point mutations. Taken together, eight of nine human myeloid leukemia cell lines expressed no or an undetectable amount of wild-type p53 mRNA. Three of the eight cell lines were growth factor- dependent. Our results suggest that inactivation of the p53 gene may be a common feature in myeloid leukemia cell lines and may play an important role in the establishment of these cell lines",

A sequential combined technique of polymerase chain reaction-mediated single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR- SSCP) or reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing were used as a simple and sensitive approach to analyze nucleotide changes. By these methods, we identified 8 missense point mutations and 2 codon deletions in 9 of the 48 patients. These mutations were located in or close to the evolutionally highly conserved regions of the p53 gene. Eight of nine patients having p53 gene alterations were in advanced clinical stage (IV).

These observations suggest that the p53 gene alteration may play an important role in lymphomagenesis and/or disease progression in some types of B-cell lymphoma",

In this study, however, we have identified p53 point mutations in metastases arising from HPV positive cervical carcinomas, suggesting that acquisition of p53 mutation may play a role in the progression of some HPV associated primary cancers.  p53 mutants identified in anogenital cancers exhibit a dominant transforming phenotype and increased resistance to HPV 16 E6 directed degradation.  The association of p53 mutation with metastases may explain the poor prognosis reported for HPV negative primary cancers, many of which already contain mutant p53.  A high proportion of p53 mutations detected in both primary and metastatic cancers are GC - >TA transversions, strongly sugesting a role for external carcinogens in the development of these cancers.",

Nucleotide alterations, most commonly single point mutations, have been shown not only to abrogate the p53 suppressor function but also to contribute to the transformed phenotype. We report the detection of a p53 gene mutation in clinical specimens of a patient with relapsing prostate adenocarcinoma 14 years after definitive external beam radiation. The techniques of single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction generated products were used for this study. Analysis of tissue from different locations of the primary tumor revealed intratumoral molecular heterogeneity; the mutation was absent in 1 area but present in another. Tumor from a regional lymph node metastasis harbored the identical p53 mutation. Furthermore, an additional genetic alteration, an allelic loss on chromosome 17p but not including the p53 gene, was observed only in the metastatic tissue. These observations in clinical specimens of primary and metastatic sites provide evidence for the association of the p53 gene in the progression of human prostate carcinoma",

To investigate the mutational spectrum associated with exposure to high levels of radon, we sequenced exons 5-9 of the p53 tumour suppressor gene and codons 12-13 of the Ki-ras protooncogene in 19 lung cancers from uranium miners exposed to radon and tobacco smoke. Mutations were not found in Ki-ras, but 9 p53 mutations, including 2 deletions, were found in 7 patients by direct DNA sequencing after polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. In tumours from 5 patients, the mutation produced an aminoacid change and an increased nuclear content of p53 protein. The tumours with either a stop codon or frame- shift deletion in the p53 gene were negative by immunohistochemistry. None of the mutations were G:C to T:A transversions in the coding strand of the p53 gene, which are the most frequent base substitutions associated with tobacco smoking, and none were found at the hotspot codons described in lung cancer. The observed differences from the usual lung cancer mutational spectrum may reflect the genotoxic effects of radon",

    "Abstract": "Analyses of cancer cell lines and of anal cancers suggest an inverse correlation between infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and somatic mutation of the p53 tumour-suppressor gene. We have investigated this association in primary cervical tumours. Tumour- tissue samples from 28 women with primary cancer of the cervix were analysed for presence of HPV sequences and for somatic mutations of the p53 gene. Southern blot analysis and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that 25 of the tumours contained HPV sequences; 20 were HPV16 positive and 5 HPV18 positive. 17 tumours subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for the short arm of chromosome 17 showed no evidence of allelic deletion. Sequencing of the entire coding region of the p53 gene by asymmetric PCR detected heterozygous point mutations in only 3 HPV-negative tumours. By contrast, in 21 HPV-positive cancers the p53 sequence was wild-type throughout. Our data indicate that loss of wild-type p53 function is important in the pathology of cervical cancer and that in the absence of an HPV-encoded gene product that mediates loss of p53 function, somatic mutation of the gene is required. This pattern of p53 mutation may partly explain the apparently worse prognosis of HPV-negative cervical cancers",

    "Title": "Clonal expansion of p53 mutant cells is associated with brain tumour progression",
    "Abstract": "Tumour progression is a fundamental feature of the biology of cancer. Cancers do not arise de novo in their final form, but begin as small, indolent growths, which gradually acquire characteristics associated with malignancy. In the brain, for example, low-grade tumours (astrocytomas) evolve into faster growing, more dysplastic and invasive high-grade tumours (glioblastomas). To define the genetic events underlying brain tumour progression, we analysed the p53 gene in ten primary brain tumour pairs. Seven pairs consisted of tumours that were high grade both at presentation and recurrence (group A) and three pairs consisted of low-grade tumours that had progressed to higher grade tumours (group B). In group A pairs, four of the recurrent tumours contained a p53 gene mutation; in three of them, the same mutation was found in the primary tumour. In group B pairs, progression to high grade was associated with a p53 gene mutation. A subpopulation of cells were present in the low-grade tumours that contained the same p53 gene mutation predominant in the cells of the recurrent tumours that had progressed to glioblastoma. Thus, the histological progression of brain tumours was associated with a clonal expansion of cells that had previously acquired a mutation in the p53 gene, endowing them with a selective growth advantage. These experimental observations strongly support Nowell's clonal evolution model of tumour progression",

    "Title": "Alterations of the p53 gene in nasopharyngeal carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy which is consistently associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The structure of the EBV genome in NPC suggests that NPC is a clonal proliferation of epithelial cells which emerges after EBV infection. The disease develops with high incidence in specific populations in discrete geographic locations, implicating possible genetic or environmental cofactors. Mutations of the p53 gene are among the most frequent genetic changes found in a large variety of human tumors. Mutations in p53 have been shown to abrogate the suppressor function of wild-type p53 and thus contribute to the transformed phenotype. To determine if mutation in p53 participates in the development of the malignant clone in NPC, the structure and sequence of p53 in 42 primary, metastatic, and nude mouse- passaged NPC specimens was analyzed. A high frequency (6 of 9) of mutations was detected in the nude mouse-passaged tumors, while only 2 of 15 metastatic and 0 of the 18 primary tumors harbored mutant p53. The p53 mutations included single-point mutations and more extensive changes such as frame shifts, deletion, duplication, or complete loss of coding sequences. These data indicate that alterations of the p53 gene are unlikely to be involved in the initial genetic events leading to the clonal outgrowth in NPC. However, although it is a rare NPC which can be established in nude mice, this growth advantage appears to be conferred on tumors bearing a mutant p53",

    "Abstract": "Four human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines, BV173, K562, KCL- 22, and KYO-1, were studied for inactivation of human tumor suppressor gene p53. Southern blotting showed allele deletion in KCL-22 and cytogenetic studies showed a chromosome 17 deletion in KYO-1 but no gross structural abnormalities in the other two lines. Northern blotting showed increased amounts of normal size p53 mRNA in BV-173 and KYO-1, trace amounts in KCL-22, and none in K562. Direct sequencing of p53 cDNA revealed a missense point mutation in KYO-1 and a single base pair deletion consistent with a coding frame shift in KCL-22. Both abnormalities in these myeloid cell lines were located in the highly conserved region of p53. Studies with two monoclonal antibodies showed that the three cell lines with p53 mRNA had readily detectable p53 proteins. In KYO-1 and BV173 cells the p53 protein was located mainly in the nuclei but KCL-22 cells had weak staining in the cytoplasm.

    "Abstract": "The molecular pathology of human pancreatic cancer is poorly understood, particularly with regard to the role of known tumor- suppressor genes. We have examined the expression of the p53 and Rb-1 tumor-suppressor genes in seven human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines and 10 primary pancreatic carcinomas. Examination of the Rb-1 gene by Northern hybridization and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed the absence of Rb-1 protein expression in two cell lines. Moreover, regions of absent nuclear staining in two primary pancreatic carcinomas were detected by immunohistochemical analysis. Investigation of p53 by Southern, Northern, immunohistochemical and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed multiple abnormalities, including gross rearrangements in two cell lines, the absence of detectable p53 transcript in two cell lines and a truncated transcript in one line. Six cell lines overexpressed p53 protein, while one line revealed the absence of p53 product by immunohistochemical and immunoprecipitation analyses. Sequence analysis of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene confirmed these analyses, revealing missense mutations in all seven cell lines in codons 181, 220, 248, 249, 265, 272 and 273. Of 10 mutations identified, nine were transitions and 50% were in codon 273. Immunohistochemical analyses of frozen primary pancreatic carcinomas revealed positive nuclear staining for p53 in 40% of cases. Mutations were identified in codons 238 and 286 and in intron 9 in several representative specimens.

    "Title": "Expression of p53 in human neuroblastoma- and neuroepithelioma-derived cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Overexpression of the nuclear phosphoprotein p53 has been detected in many different transformed human cell lines and primary adult tumors. Elevated steady-state levels of p53 appear to be the result of an increase in the stability of the protein and, in adult cancers, high levels of the protein are associated with mutation of the p53 gene. In this study, overexpression of p53 was detected in 4 out of 5 human neuroblastoma-derived cell lines. The protein expressed by each of these four lines had a significantly prolonged half-life relative to the p53 protein in immortalized rodent fibroblasts and normal bovine adrenal medullary cells. However, no mutations were detected in the highly conserved regions of the p53 gene in these four neuroblastoma lines and the protein being expressed was not recognized by the mutant- specific anti-p53 monoclonal antibody, PAb 240. Upon retinoic acid- induced differentiation of the LA-N-5 neuroblastoma cell line, the level of p53 protein declined, as did the level of p53 mRNA, but the half-life of the protein remained unchanged. The high level of protein observed in the undifferentiated cell lines appears to result from expression of a stable wild-type p53 protein and increased transcription. In contrast, p53 protein was undetectable in two neuroepithelioma-derived cell lines; the p53 gene in one of these lines contained a nonsense mutation, while the other transcribed truncated p53 mRNA",

About 60% of the cases displayed nuclear p53 overexpression as revealed by immunostaining with PAb1801, PAb122 and PAb240 monoclonal antibodies. This phenomenon was associated with the presence of structural and/or transcriptional alterations of the p53 gene. Our results provide evidence that p53 abnormalities constitute the most frequent genetic alteration identified so far in LSCC and indicate that the abnormal accumulation of the protein correlates with the presence of p53-mutated versions. These findings, taken together with the peculiar biochemical properties of p53, support the hypothesis of a possible pathogenetic relationship between smoke carcinogen exposure and p53 inactivation in the development of this tumor type",

Using a polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) approach, eight of the 10 HMCL were found to bear a mutated p53 gene. All the mutations were single base substitutions with a predominance of G:C to A:T transitions. There was no apparent relation between the presence of a mutation and IL-6 requirement of the cell line. Interestingly, in two cell lines (XG-2 and XG-4) the SSCP pattern showed the presence of both the wild-type and the mutated allele and, upon reverse PCR on RNA, both alleles were found to be concomitantly expressed at the RNA level. Moreover, three freshly explanted tumor samples had the same p53 gene status (mutated versus wild type) as the HMCL that were derived from them. These results show that p53 mutations are frequent in HMCL. Although no apparent relation could be evidenced with the loss of exogenous IL-6 requirement, it may prove interesting to investigate further potential relations between the presence of a mutated p53 allele and gradual autonomy for cell growth",

    "Title": "High frequency of somatically acquired p53 mutations in small-cell lung cancer cell lines and tumors",
    "Abstract": "We analysed the p53 open reading frame (ORF) in 16 small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines by direct sequencing of cDNA/PCR products and in 20 SCLC tumors by chemical cleavage and single-strand conformation polymorphism analyses of genomic DNA/PCR products. Abnormalities of p53 were found in 16/16 cell lines (100%) and in 16/20 tumors (80%). In the SCLC cell lines, mutations (59% missense, 18% nonsense and 23% splicing) changing the coding sequence were dispersed between amino acids 68 and 342. In the tumor samples, while the mutations occurred predominantly in exons 5-8, other mutations were located outside these regions. G to T transversions were common, occurring in 32% of the cases. We found no p53 mutations in the corresponding normal tissue from 19 patients whose tumors had p53 lesions, indicating that the mutations were all somatically acquired. In analysing the clinical data of the patients we found no correlation between tumor response to therapy or survival and the location or type of mutations. We conclude from these data that: (1) p53 mutations are found in SCLC with high frequency; (2) p53 mutations in a significant fraction of cases generate cDNAs with nonsense or splicing mutations; and (3) to date, these mutations have all been somatically acquired events",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines and their correlation with the presence of ras mutations and clinical features",
    "Abstract": "We screened 77 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines for mutations of the p53 gene using a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay. We found that 57 cell lines (74%) had mutations of the p53 gene. Three cell lines had a deletion of the p53 gene. Of the remaining 54 cell lines, 49 cell lines were sequenced and 52 mutations were confirmed. In contrast to previously published p53 mutations in other human tumors, the p53 gene mutations in NSCLC were diverse with regard to the location and nature of the mutations. The region corresponding to codons 144-166, which is outside the evolutionarily conserved regions, was a frequent site of p53 gene mutations in NSCLC. The presence of a p53 gene mutation was not associated with age, sex, histological types, culture site, treatment intent, presence of prior cytotoxic treatment, neuroendocrine differentiation, median culture time or patient survival. The prevalence of p53 mutations in cell lines with ras mutations did not differ from that in cell lines without ras mutations. However, p53 gene mutations in NSCLC cell lines with ras mutations tended to cluster in exon 8, suggesting the presence of a functional domain of the p53 gene relating to interaction with the ras gene. We conclude that p53 and ras mutations are frequent and apparently independent genetic alterations which play different roles in the pathogenesis, progression and prognosis of NSCLC",

    "Title": "Alterations of the p53 gene are common and critical events for the maintenance of malignant phenotypes in small-cell lung carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "To clarify the incidence, timing and pathogenetic significance of p53 gene alterations in the progression of small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), 17 primary tumors, 13 metastases and nine cell lines from 27 patients were analysed by a polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. Allelic losses and mutations of the p53 gene were detected in 24 out of 25 informative cases (96%) and 23 out of 27 cases (85%) respectively. Simultaneous losses and mutations were detected in all 16 stage III-IV tumors, while these alterations were detected only in 3 of 6 stage I-II tumors. When allelic losses and/or mutations were detected in the primary tumors, the same alterations were always maintained in the process of metastasis. In three cases, identical p53 alterations were detected among different organ metastases. The mutations detected in five cell lines were also detected in the corresponding original tumors. These results suggest that the alterations of the p53 gene are common and early events, but probably not the first events, in the development of SCLC, and that these alterations are essential for the maintenance of malignant phenotypes in the progression of SCLC",

    "Abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and tumor tissues used for cell line establishment were examined for p53 tumor-suppressor gene mutation using cellular DNAs and RNAs. For sensitive and rapid detection, a newly designed two-stage filtration strategy was used. Full advantage was taken of the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) of cDNA and cellular DNA fragments amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by DNA sequencing of mutated fragments. Fourteen out of 15 cells lines and the corresponding five tumor tissues had p53 mutations within the region of exons 5-8. Loss of normal alleles was noted in 14 lines, but not in one in which only mutated transcripts were detected. DNA sequencing indicated six out of 14 mutations to be in positions that have so far not been reported. In two special cases, novel mutations were found in the splicing donor sequence of exon 6, and consequently the cryptic splice site had to be used. Extremely frequent p53 gene mutations indicated that the mutations are likely be intimately involved in the carcinogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma",

    "Title": "Expression of mutant p53 proteins in lung cancer correlates with the class of p53 gene mutation",
    "Abstract": "We investigated the immunocytochemical staining and immunoblotting characteristics of 33 different p53 mutant proteins identified in lung cancer cell lines (18 small-cell lung cancer and 15 non-small-cell lung cancer) using monoclonal antibodies pAbs 240, 421 and 1801. The p53 mutants studied were representative of those found in lung cancer and included three deletions, four nonsense, seven splicing and 19 missense lesions. Control cell lines included six B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and two lung cancer cell lines without p53 mutations. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated 16 cell lines (48%) with definite overexpression of p53 protein (the high-expresser group of mutants), while in the remainder of cases either no p53 expression or low levels of p53 protein expression were found (the low-expresser group of mutants). The type of p53 mutation correlated with the expresser group. High expressers all had p53 missense mutations in exons 5-8, and immunocytochemistry identified 16/17 (94%) of these mutants. Several classes of p53 mutations occur in the low-expresser groups: deletions, splicing mutants, nonsense mutants and missense mutations outside of exons 5-8 all resulted in very low or undetectable levels of p53 protein. We conclude that there are low- and high-expression groups of p53 mutants in lung cancer and that the detection of protein expression in tumor cells by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting is dependent upon the type of mutation of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene",

    "Title": "p53 and RAS gene mutations in multiple myeloma",
    "Abstract": "We analysed genomic DNA from 30 patients with multiple myeloma (MM), searching for alterations in the p53 and RAS genes by a combination of polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism techniques. Mutations in the p53 gene were observed in 20% (6 out of 30) of the patients, and were located in conserved sequence blocks within exons 5 and 7. These were single-nucleotide substitutions and consisted predominantly (4/6) of G:C to A:T transitions. Of the six patients with a mutated p53 gene, four were in the terminal phase of the disease. RAS gene mutations were found more frequently since they occurred in 47% (14 out of 30) of the patients. Mutations consisted of single-nucleotide substitutions, located in codons 12, 13 and 61 of either K- or N-RAS, to the exclusion of H-RAS. Moreover, one patient bore two simultaneous mutations, affecting simultaneously the K- and the N-RAS genes. RAS gene mutations were more frequently observed in patients with fulminating disease (10/15, 67%) than in patients with less aggressive forms of the disease (4/15, 26%). We also analysed genomic DNAs from 10 human myeloma cell lines, of which two bore mutations affecting codon 12 of the K-RAS gene, and one codon 12 of the N-RAS gene. The first two cell lines were obtained from freshly explanted tumor cells in which we observed identical mutations. Results presented here show that activating mutations in the RAS genes are, in MM, more frequent than those affecting the p53 gene and suggest that both events are related to terminal phases of the disease",

    "Abstract": "Bronchial epithelial dysplasia is believed to precede invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Six paired dysplasia and tumour samples were distinguished histologically in sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung tissue from patients with lung cancer. Additionally, samples of dysplastic bronchial epithelium were obtained from patients without lung tumours. Microdissection of the unstained sections provided dysplastic and tumour samples from which DNA was prepared for comparison with the patients' constitutional genotype, using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All six samples of tumour and the paired adjacent samples of bronchial dysplasia showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at loci on the short arm of chromosome 3. Five of the six cases showed involvement of the p53 gene as assessed by LOH at the AccII site within the gene, and by immunoreactivity to CM-1, an antibody which recognizes the mutated form of the p53 protein in paraffin-embedded material. Of the dysplastic samples, obtained from patients without invasive tumours, all three showed LOH at 3p; one sample showed LOH at the AccII polymorphic locus within the p53 gene, and another sample, uninformative at this locus, stained positively with this antibody. These results indicate that somatic genetic changes are present in preinvasive lesions in the bronchus",

    "Abstract": "The wild-type (wt) human tumor-suppressor gene product, p53, and its mutant form have been analysed in an in vivo system in which the inducible expression of wt p53 results in growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Two major pools of p53 are detected after wt p53 expression by their differential reactivity with the p53 monoclonal antibodies PAb 421 and 1801 as well as the mutant and wt-specific monoclonal antibodies PAb 240 and 1620; one pool contains wt and mutant p53 and is characterized as having a mutant conformation, whereas the other pool contains only wt p53 with a wt conformation. As G1 arrest is entered, the amount of wt p53 associated with the mutant pool decreases, such that by 12 h free wt and mutant p53 are the major pools. Two-dimensional gel analysis of the p53 pools revealed that free wt p53 is phosphorylated to a greater degree than mutant p53, which correlated with the loss of the PAb 421 epitope on wt p53. In summary, the ability of wt p53 to exert an antiproliferative effect correlates with the presence of a unique conformational state of wt p53 characterized by increased phosphorylation and the loss of both the PAb 421 epitope and association with mutant p53 pool, whereas mutant p53 is unable to assume this conformational state",

Six original tumors were of embryonal histology, four alveolar, and one mixed. p53 mutations were identified in four of the six tumors or cell lines derived from tumors with embryonal histology and in one of the four with alveolar histology. Consistent with p53 allele loss, each mutation was found in the homo- or hemizygous state. One tumor showed a G to C transversion at p53 codon 213 (arginine to proline), and another showed deletion of the entire gene. The p53 mutations in cell lines included a codon 248 C to T transition (arginine to tryptophan) in RD and a codon 280 A to T transversion (arginine to serine) in RH30. The cell line CTR contained a 4-base pair deletion at codons 219/220 in exon 6 with resultant frame shift and premature termination in exon 7. These data support the role of diverse types of p53 mutations in the pathogenesis and/or progression of a significant proportion of cases of childhood RMS",

    "Abstract": "Immunohistochemical staining for the p53 protein was performed in 107 snap frozen primary endometrial adenocarcinomas and 15 benign uterine tissues using monoclonal antibody PAb1801. No staining was seen in benign samples, whereas intense nuclear staining of cancer cells consistent with overexpression of the p53 protein was observed in 22 of 107 cancers (21%). p53 overexpression was more frequent in advanced (Stage III/IV) cancers (41%) than in early (Stage I/II) cancers (9%) (P less than 0.001), and also was associated with nonendometrioid histology (P = 0.008), positive peritoneal cytology (P = 0.01), extrauterine metastases (P = 0.003), and negative progesterone receptor status (P = 0.04). To confirm the relationship between p53 overexpression and mutation, p53 mRNA from 8 cancers was reverse transcribed and amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. DNA sequencing revealed point mutations in each of the 5 cancers that overexpressed p53, whereas the wild-type sequence was found in 3 cancers that did not overexpress the protein. Each of the 5 mutations resulted in an amino acid substitution in a highly conserved region of the p53 gene where mutations have been found in other cancers. Further studies are warranted to determine whether the association between p53 overexpression and advanced stage disease is due to accumulation of genetic lesions during tumor progression or whether p53 alterations confer a more virulent phenotype",

Many p53 mutations result in a protein product having a prolonged half-life compared to wild-type p53. The mutant protein is frequently detectable immunohistochemically, whereas the wild-type p53 present in normal cells is not. We examined 90 colorectal carcinomas for increased expression of p53 using 3 p53 specific monoclonal antibodies, PAb1801, PAb421, and PAb240. Overall, 70% of the colorectal carcinomas stained for p53. Each tumor's DNA was also assessed for loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17p, the location of the p53 gene. Of those tumors that reacted with the anti-p53 antibodies, 76% showed loss on chromosome 17p. Tumors with loss of heterozygosity on 17p generally stained with all 3 antibodies, whereas those without loss tended to stain with just one antibody, typically PAb240. Fifteen tumors were examined for the presence of specific p53 mutations. A total of 10 mutations were found, 6 were missense and 2 were deletions, and all but one of the tumors with missense mutations stained for p53",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 gene were analyzed in 40 gliomas using the single strand conformation polymorphism assay together with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis to assess loss of heterozygosity for 17p alleles in the same tumors. Mutations occurred in 40% of the gliomas and were found in exons 4-8 of the p53 gene. G:C to T:A transversions, which occur in high frequency in some lung (greater than 50%), liver (greater than 80%), breast (30%), and esophageal cancers (25%), were noted in greater than 25% of the gliomas studied here. These transversions were clustered in exon 5 from codons 156 to 168, a region of the p53 gene not previously associated with a high frequency of mutation, and may represent a new hot spot for mutations in certain cancers. The majority of gliomas (27 of 38) analyzed here retained both 17p alleles. The frequency of p53 mutations was 37% in this group of tumors and increased to 64% in tumors with one 17p allele. Allelic loss for chromosome 17p occurred in 4 of 11 gliomas independently of mutations in the p53 gene. Absence of p53 mutations in 36% of the tumors with one 17p allele suggests that a tumor suppressor gene other than p53 may be located on chromosome 17p and involved in progression to malignancy of some gliomas",

    "Title": "p53 mutation and loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 17 and 10 during human astrocytoma progression",
    "Abstract": "The human brain tumor, astrocytoma, typically progresses through three histopathologically defined stages with the passage of time: one premalignant stage, low-grade astrocytoma; and two malignant stages, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme. We correlated the results of a sequence analysis of the tumor suppressor gene, p53, and a restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of chromosomes 17 and 10 in 45 patients with cerebral astrocytomas at different stages. To detect p53 mutations in tumor DNA, we analyzed polymerase chain reaction products corresponding to every p53-coding exon for single- strand conformation polymorphisms and confirmed the mutations by sequencing. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was determined by Southern transfer analysis of somatic and tumor DNA from these same patients using polymorphic markers for various loci on chromosomes 10 and 17. p53 mutations were found in 7 of 25 glioblastomas (28%), in 5 of 14 anaplastic astrocytomas (36%) but in 0 of 6 low-grade astrocytomas. p53 mutations were found in 62% of patients with LOH on chromosome 17p. These results indicated that p53 inactivation is a common genetic event in astrocytoma progression that may signal the transition from benign to malignant tumor stages. LOH on chromosome 10 was found in 61% of glioblastomas, in 23% of anaplastic astrocytomas, but in 0% of low- grade astrocytomas. LOH on chromosome 10 and p53 mutation were found together only in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (22%), suggesting that these genetic changes may accumulate during astrocytoma progression",

    "Abstract": "Mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the p53 gene were analyzed in 274 colorectal tumors of 4 histopathological grades. Among 160 tumors from 40 familial adenomatous polyposis patients, none of 58 adenomas with moderate dysplasia had p53 mutations, whereas 8% (3 of 37) of severe adenomas, 15% (6 of 40) of intramucosal carcinomas, and 40% (10 of 25) of invasive carcinomas had p53 mutations. Only 3% (1 of 33) of severe adenomas showed both mutation and LOH, while 25% (6 of 24) of intramucosal carcinomas and 40% (10 of 25) of invasive carcinomas had both mutation and LOH. All intramucosal and invasive carcinomas that had mutations lost the other allele of the p53 gene. In 114 tumors from 86 non-familial adenomatous polyposis patients, similar results were obtained; no adenoma showed both mutation and LOH, but both alterations occurred in intramucosal and invasive carcinoma. As regards specificity in 56 mutations detected in the present study, the frequently affected codons were codons 175, 238, 245, 248, 273, and 282, 4 of these amino acids being arginine, and 72% (39 of 54) of all mutations were GC to AT transition. Although expression into p53 polyadenylated RNA was high in every invasive carcinoma irrespective of the presence of mutation or LOH, there was a correlation between mutation and protein level; immunostaining of p53 protein was negative in almost all adenomas, but it was positive in 86% of invasive carcinomas exhibiting p53 mutation. These data suggest that genetic changes on both alleles of the p53 gene through mutation and LOH, which result in abnormal protein accumulation, are involved in the conversion of adenoma to early carcinoma. Also, carcinoma cells with p53 mutations existing within adenoma tissues are detectable by immunostaining, even in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens",

We detected 23 p53 mutations within these exons in 22 lung cancers; no p53 mutations were found in normal tissue of the patients. One-half of the mutations were G to T transversions on the nontranscribed strand, consistent with mutagenesis by tobacco smoke. Mutations of C to A on the nontranscribed strand, which would result from G to T mutations on the transcribed strand, were detected only in one sample. Three of 23 mutations were nonsense mutations; to date, nonsense mutations of p53 have not been reported in lung cancer. Mutation of this p53-coding region was detected in 20 of 27 small cell lung cancer samples, representing a 70% occurrence. Mutation of the p53 gene is apparently very frequent in small cell lung cancers. When LOH in the p53 region could be determined, complete concordance occurred between a sample having both a p53 mutation and LOH in the region of p53 (18 of 18 samples). Twelve samples of lung cancer had LOH in the region of p53, but the samples had no detectable p53 mutations, suggesting either alterations outside the known mutational hot spots of p53 or alterations of another unidentified tumor suppressor gene in the region of p53",

    "Title": "Unique association of p53 mutations with undifferentiated but not with differentiated carcinomas of the thyroid gland",
    "Abstract": "Thyroid neoplasms show a wide variety of lesions varying from slowly growing differentiated adenocarcinomas to rapidly proliferating undifferentiated carcinomas. There has been some histopathological evidence that the undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas are derived from differentiated carcinomas. Moreover, it is suspected that some genetic events might be associated with such changes. In the present study, mutations in the p53 gene were investigated by direct sequencing analysis after polymerase chain reaction amplification of exons 5 to 8, using paraffin-embedded primary tumors and cultured cells. No mutations in exons 5 to 8 were detected in 10 differentiated papillary adenocarcinomas, whereas 6 of 7 undifferentiated carcinomas were found to carry base substitution mutations. Sequencing analysis confirmed mutations at codons 135 (TGC----TGT), 141 (CCC----CCT), 178 (CAC---- GAC), 213 (CGA----TGA), 248 (CGG----CAG, CGG----TGG), and 273 (CGT---- TGT). The spectrum of mutations (G:C to A:T transitions in 7 of 8) might be a specific feature of the spontaneous cancers. The results strongly suggest that, in human thyroid glands, p53 mutations play a crucial role in the progression of differentiated carcinomas to undifferentiated ones",

    "Abstract": "Twenty cell lines from 17 individuals with malignant mesothelioma have been examined for p53 alterations by direct sequencing of genomic DNA, by evaluation of mRNA expression levels, and by immunocytochemical analysis of p53 protein expression in comparison with normal human pleural mesothelial cells. The results of this study show p53 abnormalities in cell lines from 3 individuals. These include 2 point mutations and one null cell line. Interestingly, while both cell lines with point mutations exhibit high levels of p53 protein, normal mesothelial cells as well as 12 of the mesotheliomas evaluated express low but significant levels. In addition, sequencing of K-ras at codons 12, 13, and 61 reveals wild-type sequence in all 20 mesothelioma cell lines. The capacity to induce tumors in athymic nude mice did not correlate with the presence of a p53 mutation or elevated p53 protein levels. These data suggest that neither p53 alteration nor K-ras activation constitutes a critical step in the development of human mesothelioma",

    "Title": "Aberrations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in human non-small cell carcinomas of the lung",
    "Abstract": "Aberrations of the p53 gene in 115 surgical specimens of non-small cell carcinomas of the lung were examined by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction products. Structural abnormalities of the p53 gene were observed in 60 tumors (52%), i.e., 8 of 14 large cell carcinomas, 24 of 58 adenocarcinomas, 25 of 37 squamous cell carcinomas, and 3 of 6 adenosquamous carcinomas. Direct sequencing of abnormal DNA fragments revealed 45 single-base substitutions, 9 deletions or insertion of a short nucleotide sequence, and 3 two-base substitutions in 57 tumors. In the other 3 tumors, loss of one of the p53 alleles was observed, with no mutation in the other allele. Allelic loss of the p53 gene was observed in 14 of 43 informative cases (33%), and in 11 of the 14 cases the remaining allele was mutated. The aberrations of the p53 gene were not limited to a particular histological type or clinical stage. Their high frequency suggests that they were involved in the genesis of non-small cell carcinomas of the lung. The mutation frequency (46%) of the p53 gene in tumors carrying mutated ras genes was essentially the same as the overall frequency in lung cancers, suggesting that accumulation of mutations in these two genes in a tumor is a random phenomenon",

    "Abstract": "Alterations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene and Epstein-Barr virus status were investigated in 15 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) biopsies, 4 xenografts, and 2 cell lines from the Cantonese region of southern China. One other established NPC cell line obtained from a northern Chinese patient was also studied. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed a loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 17p, where the p53 gene resides, in only one of 15 NPC biopsies. Polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing failed to detect sequence alterations in exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene in the 15 tumors and in the 4 NPC xenografts, all of which tested positive for Epstein-Barr virus. In contrast, the 3 NPC cell lines were all negative for Epstein-Barr virus and contained G----C transversions in the p53 gene, with cell lines CNE- 1 and CNE-2 harboring identical AGA (arginine) to ACA (threonine) changes at codon 280. These results suggest that p53 inactivation is not a necessary component of nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis in Cantonese but may be important in the establishment of cell lines derived from these tumors",

The frequency of G-T transversions and the incidence of guanosine mutations in the nontranscribed strand of the p53 gene were found to be higher than expected, and we suggest, therefore, that exogenous carcinogens have an etiological role in sporadic breast cancers. Mutations were recorded in 44 codons of the p53 gene, with no obvious mutational hot-spots, although mutations at codons 175, 194, 273, and 280 accounted for 25% of the changes. One germ-line mutation was found in 136 patients and so we conclude that constitutional mutation of p53 may be an uncommon etiological factor in breast cancer",

    "Title": "p53 mutation and protein accumulation during multistage human esophageal carcinogenesis",
    "Abstract": "Preinvasive lesions of squamous cell carcinoma are well defined morphologically and provide a model for multistage carcinogenesis. Since alterations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene occur frequently in invasive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, we examined a set of preinvasive lesions to investigate the timing of p53 mutation. Surgically resected tissues from nine patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma contained precursor lesions which had not yet invaded normal tissues. Immunohistochemistry showed high levels of p53 protein in both preinvasive lesions and invasive carcinomas in six cases; sequence analysis of all invasive tumors identified p53 missense mutations in two cases. Preinvasive lesions from both tumors with mutations plus one wild-type tumor were microdissected and sequenced. In one patient there were different mutations in the invasive carcinoma (codon 282, CGGarg > TGGtrp) and a preinvasive lesion (codon 272, GTGval > T/GTGleu/val). In a second case, an invasive carcinoma had a mutation in codon 175 (CGCarg > CAChis), and adjacent preinvasive lesions contained a wild-type sequence. A carcinoma and preinvasive lesion from the third case contained high levels of protein and a wild- type DNA sequence. Therefore, p53 mutation may precede invasion in esophageal carcinogenesis, and multifocal esophageal neoplasms may arise from independent clones of transformed cells. The timing of p53 protein accumulation is favorable for an intermediate biomarker in multistage esophageal carcinogenesis",

A total of 20 cases (32.8%) were found to have mutations; 36.6% (15 of 41) for the hepatitis B surface antigen positive group and 25.0% (5 of 20) for the hepatitis B surface antigen negative group. The corresponding normal liver showed no mutation. The mutation is widely distributed throughout exons 5 to 8. Only 4 cases (6.6%), all positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, had a specific hot spot mutation at codon 249 with G to T transversion. Our results show that scattered point mutations in p53 are not uncommon in hepatocellular carcinoma samples from Taiwan and may be important in the development of this cancer. However, the aflatoxin related specific mutation seems much less related to the genesis of hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan",

    "Abstract": "To elucidate the molecular basis for endocrine tumorigenesis, p53 mutations in human endocrine tumors were analyzed by using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism. Exons 5 through 10 of the p53 gene were studied in genomic DNAs from 134 primary endocrine tumors and 6 human endocrine cancer-derived cell lines. Mutations were detected and identified in 4 endocrine tumors, including one parathyroid adenoma and three thyroid carcinoma cell lines. The sites of these mutations were in exons 5 (codon 151 and 152) and 7 (codon 248 and 255). In all of three tumor cell lines, but not in a parathyroid adenoma, the normal allele encoding the p53 gene was lost. However, p53 mutations were not found in any other endocrine tumors or cell lines. Based upon these results, we concluded that the p53 gene may play a role in the tumorigenesis of a limited number of parathyroid adenoma and thyroid cancers, and that the p53 mutation with an allelic loss of the p53 gene is an important factor in malignant tumorigenesis of the thyroid gland",

    "Abstract": "Using a polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism approach we analyzed 96 human primary breast tumors for the presence of mutations in exons 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of the p53 gene. These exons have been shown to comprise highly conserved sequences and the portion including exons 5 through 9 is believed to be the target for over 90% of the acquired mutations in human cancer. Eighteen tumors of the 96 (18.7%) tested showed reproducibly a variant band indicative of a mutation. Most (15 tumors) of the mutations were single nucleotide substitutions and G:C to A:T transitions were prevalent (6 tumors), G:C to T:A transversions came next (4 tumors), and guanines were always on the nontranscribed strand. Concomitant loss of the wild type allele and mutation of the other copy was observed in only 3 of 18 mutated cases; this is consistent with the heterogeneous cellular composition of breast tumors. Furthermore p53 mutations were correlated to estrogen and/or progesterone receptor negative tumors, thus indicating their relationships to aggressive breast cancer. No association could be observed with DNA amplification events in these tumors",

    "Abstract": "To further investigate the role of p53 gene inactivation in gastric tumorigenesis, the mutational status of the p53 gene in primary human gastric cancer samples was examined. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and subsequent direct sequencing of the p53 gene from gastric cancer samples revealed frequent point mutations of the p53 gene: some of these coincided with those previously identified in gastric cancer cell lines. In addition, both allelic deletion analysis using pYNZ 22 and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis demonstrated an allelic deletion of the p53 gene in cancer tissue which contained a point mutation of the p53 gene in the remaining allele. Transfection of the wild-type or mutant p53 genes into gastric cancer cells showed that the wild-type but none of the mutated p53 genes suppressed the colony formation of gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, the incorporation of thymidine into DNA was reduced in cancer cells expressing the wild-type p53 gene. The glutathione S- transferase-wild type p53 fusion protein bound to simian virus 40 large T antigen in COS-1 cell lysate. None of the p53 fusion proteins containing mutations at codons 143, 175, 248, or 273 bound to simian virus 40 large T antigen. By contrast, two different mutant p53 fusion proteins containing mutations specifically observed in gastric cancer bound to simian virus 40 large T antigen. These results indicate that inactivation of the p53 gene through mutations and the allelic deletion may play an important role in gastric tumorigenesis. These mutations may cause a conformational change in the p53 protein resulting in the loss of the suppression by p53 of the growth of gastric cells, partly through disruption of the association of p53 protein with a cellular component",

    "Title": "Occurrence of p53 gene deletions and human papilloma virus infection in human head and neck cancer",
    "Abstract": "Little is known regarding the molecular genetic events in head and neck carcinoma. Epidemiological evidence suggests that both alcohol and tobacco use are related to the development of these neoplasms, and viral infections have also been postulated to play a role in some tumors. Loss of p53 tumor suppressor gene function has been found in many malignancies and can occur through either gene mutation or by interaction with the E6 protein of oncogenic human papilloma viruses (HPV). Because the mucosal surfaces of the head and neck are exposed to mutagens and HPVs, we studied DNA derived from 30 stage I-IV squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (9 primary tumors and 21 early passage cell lines) for p53 gene mutations as well as for the presence of oncogenic HPV DNA. Exons 2 through 11 of the p53 gene were examined using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by direct genomic sequencing of all variants. HPV detection was done using polymerase chain reaction amplification with HPV E6 region type specific primers as well as L1 region degenerate ('consensus') primers; HPV type was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the amplified fragment as well as by Southern blotting of genomic DNA. Sixteen of 30 tumors (53%) had p53 mutations and oncogenic HPV DNA was detected in 3 of 30 (10%) tumors, none of which had p53 mutations. The p53 mutational spectrum observed was characterized by equal frequencies of transversions (6 of 16), transitions (5 of 16), and deletions (5 of 16). This distribution of mutations differs from the spectrum of p53 mutation reported in esophageal (P = 0.05) and lung (P = 0.02) cancers, two other tobacco associated neoplasms. A previously undescribed clustering of 3 mutations at codon 205 was also observed. A trend toward a shorter time to tumor recurrence after treatment was noted for those patients with tumors exhibiting p53 gene mutations, and no relationship between p53 mutations and tumor stage or node status was noted. Alteration in p53 gene function appears common in head and neck cancer, and the mutational spectrum observed may reflect the role of different mutagens or mutagenic processes than those responsible for the p53 mutations in lung and esophageal neoplasms",

    "Title": "p53 mutations are associated with 17p allelic loss in grade II and grade III astrocytoma",
    "Abstract": "Loss of genetic material on the short arm of chromosome 17 is observed in approximately 40% of human astrocytomas (WHO grades II and III) and in approximately 30% of cases of glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV). Previous studies of glioblastoma multiforme have shown that the p53 gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 17, is frequently mutated in these glioblastomas. To explore whether lower-grade astrocytomas are also associated with corresponding mutations of the p53 gene, we have investigated a series of 22 human astrocytomas of WHO grades II and III both for loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17p and for p53 mutations. Mutations in the conserved regions of the p53 gene were identified by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 5, 6, 7, and 8 and were verified by direct DNA sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products. p53 mutations were observed in 3 of 8 grade II astrocytomas and 4 of 14 grade II astrocytomas. In all 22 tumors, allelic loss of the short arm of chromosome 17 was investigated by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. One-half of the grade II astrocytomas (4 of 8) and grade III astrocytomas (7 of 14) exhibited allelic loss on chromosome 17p. Mutations in the p53 gene were exclusively observed in tumors with allelic loss on 17p. Our results show that p53 mutations are not restricted to glioblastoma multiforme and may be important in the tumorigenesis of lower-grade astrocytomas and that p53 mutations in lower-grade astrocytomas are associated with loss of chromosome 17p. These findings are consistent with a recessive mechanism of action of p53 in WHO grade II and III astrocytoma tumorigenesis",

    "Title": "Alterations of the p53 gene in human primary cervical carcinoma with and without human papillomavirus infection",
    "Abstract": "A previous report using cervical carcinoma cell lines suggests that the inactivation of two tumor suppressor gene products, p53 and pRB, either by complex formation with the E6 and E7 proteins of oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) or by mutation, may be an important step in cervical carcinogenesis (M. Scheffner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88: 5523-5527, 1991). The present study was designed to clarify the association between p53 inactivation and infection with oncogenic HPVs in primary carcinomas of human uterine cervix. We examined 36 primary cervical carcinomas for the presence of HPV DNAs by Southern blot analysis with probes specific for HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -52, -56, and -58. HPV DNA sequences were detected in 19 of 36 tumors: 10 cases with HPV-16; 3 cases with -18; 3 cases with -58; 2 cases with -56; and one case with -52. The presence of HPV-16 and -18 in cervical carcinomas was further reexamined using polymerase chain reaction. HPV DNA sequences were detected in an additional 10 cases: 9 cases with -16 and one case with -18. The inactivation of the p53 gene by allelic loss or by point mutation was also examined. No allelic loss at the polymorphic site in codon 72 of the p53 gene was detected in any of 10 informative cases. Missense point mutations in the highly conserved regions of the p53 gene were demonstrable as single-stranded conformational polymorphisms of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments and subsequently identified by direct DNA sequencing. Point mutations were detected in only two cases: one with an ATG----CTG transversion in codon 133 of exon 5, resulting in a Met----Leu substitution, and another with a CGG----TGG transition in codon 248 of exon 7, resulting in an Arg----Trp substitution. Both tumors with point mutations in p53 genes were among 10 tumors which contained a small copy number of HPV-16 DNA sequences (1 copy of HPV/10(1) to 10(5) cells) detectable by polymerase chain reaction amplification but not by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNAs derived from the tumors. None of 19 tumors with a large copy number of HPV DNA sequences detectable by Southern blot analysis (more than 1 copy of HPV/2 to 10 cells) nor any of 7 tumors with undetectable HPV DNA sequences contained p53 gene mutations in the regions examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "Title": "The pattern of p53 mutations in Burkitt's lymphoma differs from that of solid tumors",
    "Abstract": "Available evidence suggests that, among hematological malignancies, p53 is most often mutated in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). However, much of the published data is based on cell lines. We have, therefore, analyzed BL biopsies to determine more accurately the frequency and pattern of p53 mutations in primary tumors and to determine whether there are differences among the various subtypes of BL. Among 27 BL biopsies from South Africa, we have observed mutations in the p53 gene (exons 5 through 8) in 37% of tumors. The higher frequency of mutations in cell lines (70%) suggests that mutation of p53 may be associated with tumor progression. Summarizing available data we conclude that the presence of mutated p53 in BL is independent of the geographic origin of the tumor, the 8;14 chromosomal breakpoint locations and Epstein-Barr virus association. We also find that the mutational spectrum of p53 in BL differs from that observed in nonlymphoid tumors. More than 50% of mutations in BL are clustered in a small stretch of 33 amino acids (codons 213 to 248). Interestingly, codon 213 appears to be as frequently mutated as codon 248. Conversely, codon 273, often mutated in solid tumors, is rarely involved in BL",

    "Abstract": "In an effort to analyze molecular mechanisms of human ovarian carcinogenesis, we studied the structure and expression of the p53 gene in different cell lines established from human ovarian carcinomas. In all six lines (PA-1, Caov-3 and -4, OVCAR-3, SK-OV-3, and Kuramochi), p53 abnormalities were detected. In the SK-OV-3 cell line, Southern analysis suggested the presence of sequence deletions/rearrangements in at least one allele of the p53 gene, and transcripts were not detectable by either Northern or polymerase chain reaction analysis. Sequence analysis of the entire coding region of the p53 gene revealed point mutations resulting in codon changes of a highly conserved region of the protein in four cell lines, Caov-3 and -4, OVCAR-3, and Kuramochi. In the Caov-3 cell line, the point mutation resulted in chain termination at codon 136. Quantitation of p53 protein by immunoprecipitation analysis revealed a 6-fold higher than control cell level in PA-1. By contrast, p53 protein was not detectable in lines Caov-3 and SK-OV-3. We conclude that altered levels of p53 gene expression and/or mutant forms of the p53 gene product are associated with all human ovarian cancer cells tested",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutation spectrum in hepatocellular carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "In order to clarify the significance of mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in the genesis and development of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in an aflatoxin B1 low-exposure area, the spectrum, i.e., incidence, type, and site, of p53 gene mutations was examined in 169 tissue samples resected mainly from Japanese patients using single- strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. Forty- nine tumors (29%) showed a p53 mutation (39 point mutations and 10 frameshifts). The point mutations comprised 18 transitions, only 4 of which occurred at CpG sites, and 21 transversions. Two evolutionarily conserved domains, IV and V, contained 65% of all mutations and codon 249 was the most frequent mutation site (7/49). The spectrum of p53 mutation did not differ among HCCs in relation to the type of hepatitis virus infection, sex, age, and background liver disease of patients, tumor size, or presence of metastasis, but incidence and site were significantly associated with the degree of differentiation of cancer cells. In poorly differentiated HCC, p53 mutation was frequent (54%) and clustered on domains IV and V, whereas in well or moderately differentiated HCC, the mutation was less frequent (21%) and equally distributed on domains II to V. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17p in 55 (69%) of 80 informative cases and in 34 (95%) of 36 cases with p53 mutation. Therefore, p53 gene mutation is suggested to occur independently of the type of viral infection or status of preexisting liver disease and to occur preferentially in moderately and poorly differentiated HCCs in association with or after loss of another p53 allele as a late event of HCC progression",

    "Title": "Mutation spectrum of the p53 gene in bone and soft tissue sarcomas",
    "Abstract": "We present here an analysis of the spectrum of mutations of the p53 gene seen in 127 bone and soft tissue sarcomas of various histological classifications. Gross rearrangements were analyzed by Southern blotting using a complementary DNA probe from the p53 gene, and subtle alterations in the entire coding sequence (exons 2 through 11) were identified by a combination of single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct genomic sequencing. A total of 42 somatic alterations of the p53 gene were found, of which 21 were gross rearrangements and 21 were subtle alterations. These included 17 cases of a single base substitution, 3 small deletions, and one single base insertion. In contrast to reported findings for other types of cancer, we found that mutations of the p53 gene in sarcomas are quite heterogeneous both in their distribution throughout the gene and in the type of genetic alterations that result. All 13 missense mutations we found occurred at highly conserved residues, whereas 8 nonsense mutations occurred at sites that spanned the gene from codons 46 to 316. Surprisingly, approximately one-half of the osteosarcomas with allelic deletions on 17p did not have detectable alterations in the coding sequence of the p53 gene",

    "Title": "Frequent p53 gene mutations in blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia, especially in myeloid crisis harboring loss of a chromosome 17p",
    "Abstract": "We investigated chromosome alterations and mutations of the p53 gene in 118 samples from 92 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in various clinical phases, i.e., chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast crisis (BC). Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and subsequent nucleotide sequencing disclosed no alteration of the p53 gene in chronic phase (no mutation in 80 samples), while five of 31 BC samples showed point mutations: four in myeloid and one in lymphoid crisis. One of seven accelerated phase samples also showed a p53 gene mutation. Ten of 31 BC samples showed loss of one of the short arms of chromosome 17 (17p) through the formation of isochromosome 17q, i(17q), or unbalanced translocations. Loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus in the accelerated phase and BC was detected only in two cases with i(17q) but not in seven cases with normal chromosome 17 homologues, suggesting that loss of one p53 allele is rare without cytogenetically detectable loss of a 17p. Among those six samples with p53 gene mutations, five showed loss of a 17p cytogenetically, and only one lymphoid crisis case exhibited normal chromosome 17 homologues. Thus, mutations of the p53 gene were closely associated with myeloid crisis with loss of a 17p (four mutations in ten samples), in contrast to myeloid crisis with normal chromosome 17 homologues (zero in 13) or lymphoid crisis (one in seven). Our results also suggest that alterations of the p53 gene might occur after loss of a 17p during the course of chronic myelogenous leukemia",

    "Abstract": "Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN) are associated strongly with the use of tobacco and alcohol, but little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors. In the present study, we analyzed SCCHN for mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 by immunocytochemistry and complementary DNA sequencing. Overexpression of p53 protein was detected in 13 (100%) of 13 SCCHN cell lines and in tumor cells cultured directly from 10 (77%) of 13 patients with SCCHN. Direct evidence for p53 mutations was obtained by sequencing p53 complementary DNA from eight SCCHN cell lines and two tumor xenografts. The genetic alterations included seven missense mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions, a mutation encoding a stop codon, one 10-base pair deletion, and one 2-base pair addition. All seven missense mutations were G to T transversions, five of which were clustered at codons 245 and 248. A similar high frequency of G to T transversions predominates in lung cancer, another tobacco-related disease. Mutation of the p53 gene is the most common genetic alteration detected in SCCHN and implicates this gene locus as a critical site of specific damage by mutagenic carcinogens in tobacco, one of the important risk factors in the etiology of this disease",

    "Abstract": "Five of six human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines characterized as radiation sensitive (SQ-38, SCC-9, SQ-9G) or radiation resistant (SQ-20B, SCC-35, JSQ-3) exhibited alterations of the p53 gene. The point mutations and a deletion were detected by using single- stranded conformational polymorphism analysis and polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing. Interestingly, three of three radiation- sensitive and two of three radiation-resistant cell lines revealed mutations in the p53 gene. Point mutations were located in exons 4, 6, and 8 (at codons 72 and 298 in JSQ-3; 273 in SCC-35; 196 in SQ-38), and deletions consisted of 32 base pairs between codons 274 and 285 in SCC- 9 and 1 base pair at codon 271 in SQ-9G. Three mutations resulted in substitutions for an arginine residue. Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed p53 protein overexpression in SCC-35 cells which contained a missense mutation at codon 273. In contrast to previous studies which linked alterations in ras, myc, and raf expression with radiation resistance, this study indicates that mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, p53, do not directly correlate with such resistance",

Whereas in the primary tumor and in some of the metastases loss of heterozygosity could not be detected for RB1 or for the 17p13 region in which TP53 is located, other metastases showed such losses of heterozygosity.  By polymerase chain reaction analysis an 18-base pair deletion from exon 5 of the TP53 gene was found in a small proportion of primary tumor cells and in one of the metastases, but not in the other metastases.  Therefore, in this case neither RB1 nor TP53 seems to play an essential role in the initiation of osteosarcoma.",

    "Title": "Frequent association of p53 gene mutation in invasive bladder cancer",
    "Abstract": "Structural alterations of the p53 gene were investigated to elucidate the molecular biological difference between superficial and invasive bladder cancer by polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. In 25 bladder cancers obtained from 23 patients, p53 gene mutations were investigated in exon regions 4 to 11. Twenty- four were transitional cell carcinomas, and the remaining one was a squamous cell carcinoma. Only one of 13 superficial bladder cancers, including pTis, pTa, and pT1, was found to have p53 gene mutation. However, of 12 invasive bladder cancers with pT2, pT3, and pT4, six primary carcinomas, including a squamous cell carcinoma and one metastatic carcinoma, were found to have p53 gene mutations. The number of cancers examined in Grades 1, 2, and 3 was three, seven, and 15, respectively. p53 gene mutation was not found in any of the ten cancers with Grades 1 and 2, while eight of 15 bladder cancers with Grade 3 were found to have p53 gene mutation. The results indicated that the incidence of p53 gene mutations appeared to be much higher in invasive- type and high-grade bladder cancers than in superficial and low-grade ones. Our results are compatible with the recently published results by Sidransky et al. [Science (Washington DC), 252: 706-709, 1991] showing that p53 gene mutations were frequently found in invasive bladder cancers by sequence analysis on polymerase chain reaction amplified products corresponding to exons 5 to 9. Our results are also compatible with previously reported results by Olumi et al. (Cancer Res., 50: 7081- 7083, 1990) showing that the loss of chromosome 17p, revealed by analysis with restriction fragment length polymorphism, was frequent in high-grade bladder cancers. In this study, p53 gene mutations were often found in exon 4 as well as in other exons. Therefore, this region should also be examined for screening of mutations of this gene in bladder cancer. There appeared to be no consistent mutation sites in exons 4 to 11 of the p53 gene and no specific patterns of the mutation in bladder cancer",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian cancers are often diagnosed at a late stage, after the cancer cells have spread to extraovarian sites. Failure to diagnose these tumors earlier may reflect the lack of symptoms and the need for a sensitive, reliable screening test. Alternatively, this can be explained by the hypothesis that some of the extraovarian tumor implants do not represent metastatic spread from the primary cancer but instead are multiple primary tumors developing simultaneously in the peritoneal epithelium. If this is the case, some patients with advanced ovarian cancer may never have had a stage I disease, making early detection theoretically impossible. In this study, we examined the mutational pattern of the p53 gene in 9 patients with epithelial ovarian cancers using tissue collected from different sites within the same patient. In all 9 cases, the mutational pattern of the p53 gene was identical in cancer cells from different sites within the same patient, strongly suggesting that these ovarian tumors were of unifocal origin and that cancer tissues collected from different sites are derived from a single origin",

    "Abstract": "Molecular analysis of malignant astrocytomas demonstrated three distinct groups of tumors with chromosome 17p abnormalities, which include (a) deletion of the p53 locus (17p13.1) and mutations in the remaining allele, (b) deletion of the p53 locus but no detectable mutations in the remaining allele, and (c) deletions not including the p53 locus but mutations in one of the alleles. Furthermore, deletion mapping analysis demonstrated allelic loss of genes distal to D17S28/D17S5 markers (17p13.3) in group C tumors. The loss of heterozygosity of genes on chromosome 17 without detectable mutation (group B) or deletion (group C) in the p53 gene implies the presence of a second tumor suppressor gene in the telomeric region of 17p, the homozygous functional inactivation of which may play a role, either alone or in conjunction with p53, in the initiation and/or progression of astrocytic neoplasms",

    "Abstract": "Human hepatocellular carcinomas from patients in Britain, an area of low prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma and low dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1, were analyzed for mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene. Abnormalities in the p53 gene were detected in 2 of 19 hepatocellular carcinomas by polymerase chain reaction--single-stranded conformation polymorphism. Direct sequencing of the evolutionarily conserved regions of p53 (exons 5, 6, 7 and 8), where mutations have been commonly found in a variety of tumors, confirmed that only two hepatocellular carcinomas had mutations in p53, one a 6-bp deletion of codons 158 and 159 (exon 5) and the other a G to A transition at codon 286 (exon 8). No mutations were found in any hepatocellular carcinoma in exons 6 and 7; in particular all tumors had wild-type sequence at codon 249, which has been reported to be a mutational hot spot in the p53 gene in hepatocellular carcinomas from high incidence areas such as China and southern Africa. Abnormalities in p53 expression were examined by immunohistochemistry and found in 1 of the 19 hepatocellular carcinomas. These findings show that p53 mutations are infrequently involved in the malignant transformation of hepatocytes in an area of low hepatocellular carcinoma prevalence. They support the suggestion of a possible link between dietary exposure to aflatoxin and selective G to T mutations at codon 249 of the p53 gene. Our observations also indicate that hepatitis B virus infection alone, present in six of the hepatocellular carcinomas examined, does not account for the specificity for codon 249 mutations reported from endemic areas",

The results were compared to analogous studies conducted with five human osteosarcoma cell lines. The p53 gene was found rearranged in the mouse tumour. The rearrangement mapped to the first intron region of the p53 gene and as a result, no p53 expression could be detected in C3HOS tumours. Using p53 genomic probes, we have detected the same rearrangement in the original radiation-induced tumour and the various clones that were isolated from it. Deletion and rearrangement of the p53 gene were also found in three out of five of the human osteosarcoma cell lines (MG-63, G-292, Saos-2). No p53 expression could be detected in these three cell lines. In the affected human osteosarcoma cell lines, the rearrangement involved the first intron region. In addition, the mouse tumor was analysed for structural and expression changes in the Rb and the c-myc genes. Normal expression of both genes were detected in the murine tumour. Only one (Saos-2) human osteosarcoma cell line exhibited gross structural alteration in the retinoblastoma gene. The results suggest that the inactivation of p53 may be an important step in the development of osteosarcomas, and that a rearrangement affecting the first intron is common in osteosarcomas",

Several tumor suppressor genes, including p53, have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, the interval between the development of Barrett's esophagus, dysplasia, and frank malignancy is usually very long. A case of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus arising from Barrett's esophagus in a 25-year-old man is discussed. Point mutation in exon 8 of p53 was discovered in this patient's tumor and surrounding dysplastic Barrett's mucosa. To our knowledge, this is the youngest reported case of Barrett's-associated esophageal adenocarcinoma in the medical literature. It suggests that acquired somatic mutations in tumor suppressor genes may occur early in life and that these mutations may contribute to the development of dysplasia and cancer in Barrett's esophagus.",

The role of p53 mutations in cell-line establishment was investigated. p53 gene mutations were detected in 5 out of 6 tissue samples from which cell lines were established and in 4 out of 5 specimens from which cell lines could not be established, suggesting that the presence of p53 gene mutations is not by itself sufficient for cell-line establishment. Tumor samples were also analyzed for point mutational activation of the ras proto-oncogenes. One out of 30 (3%) tumors showed an activating point mutation in codon 12 of H-ras, this being consistent with reports from Europe and USA but not with any from India. Compared to frequencies of the other genetic changes so far reported for oral SCC, the p53 mutations have been observed most often to undergo genetic change. p53 gene mutation is thus intimately involved in the genesis of oral SCC and consequently should be useful as a marker for the diagnosis of this neoplasm",

Since mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the single most common genetic alteration found in human malignancies, we examined the hypothesis that p53 mutations occur in human endometrial carcinoma. Sequencing analysis of exons 5-8 revealed point mutations in 3 of 21 (14%) tumors; one mutation was an unusual single-base insertion at codons 176-177, resulting in a premature stop codon, whereas the other two were CGG----TGG transitions at codon 248. Two of these tumors showed reduction to homozygosity at the p53 allele, but one tumor apparently retained heterozygosity. These data indicate that p53 mutations occur in human endometrial carcinoma, although relatively infrequently, and that loss of the normal p53 allele does not necessarily occur with point mutation of the p53 gene in this tumor type",

    "Title": "Mutations of the P53 gene in acute myeloid leukaemia",
    "Abstract": "In a previous report we found point mutations in exons 5-8 of the P53 gene in five of 46 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), with a predominance of mutations in the 10 patients with 17p monosomy. In this report we extended our findings studying such mutations in 66 unselected additional cases of AML, using polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and nucleotide sequencing. Three of the 66 new cases had a point mutation, leading to a change in one encoded amino acid. Thus, eight of the 112 AML studied had P53 mutations in exons 5-8, suggesting that the incidence of P53 mutation is relatively low in AML. A predominance of mutations in exon 8 (5/8) was found. Six of the eight patients with mutations were older than 60 years of age, and all eight cases had a short survival. All seven mutated cases karyotyped showed complex cytogenetic findings, especially monosomy 5 and/or 7, thus questioning the pathogenic importance of P53 mutations in a context of multiple genetic abnormalities. However, five of them also had 17p monosomy, and in the remaining two cases SSCP and sequence analysis also suggested loss of the normal P53 allele. This supported a role for the P53 gene mutations in leukaemogenesis in the relatively small number of AML patients in whom they were found, through loss of tumour suppressive activity of both normal P53 alleles, as reported in solid tumours",

    "Title": "Mutations of the p53 tumour suppressor gene in haematologic neoplasms",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 tumour suppressor gene have frequently been observed in several types of solid tumours and are believed to be implicated in the development of these tumours. To determine the relevance of p53 mutations in haematologic neoplasms, we performed polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis on the p53 gene in 45 patients with various types of haematologic neoplasms. In exons 5-8 containing highly conserved regions, mobility shifts indicating sequence alterations were detected in four of the 45 patients, and subsequent sequencing was performed. A point mutation resulting in a novel stop codon was detected at codon 213 in one of 23 cases of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (one of five cases of blast crisis). Point mutations causing amino acid substitutions were detected in one of four cases of myelodysplastic syndrome at codon 195, one of three cases of adult T-cell leukaemia at codon 281, and one of eight cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at codon 281, and these missense mutations were accompanied by loss of the wild type allele. Patients harbouring these nonsense and missense mutations were in advanced disease stages. These findings suggest that mutational inactivation of the p53 gene is infrequent but is involved in the tumorigenesis of several types of haematologic neoplasms at least in some cases",

A point mutation, leading to an amino acid change in the P53 protein was found in only one case, involving exon 5. These findings suggest that P53 mutations are very rare in multiple myeloma, and that this disease may be categorized among the few neoplasms where P53 abnormalities have very limited role, if any",

    "Abstract": "A polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) assay was used to identify the exons which contained point mutations in the conserved regions (exons 4-8) of the p53 gene in 49 acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) patients. SSCP analysis in our study was consistent with the results of subsequent direct DNA sequencing in detecting point mutational change in exons 5 and 8 of one AML patient and in exons 7 and 8 of two additional AML patients. The mutations were located at codons 245 and 273, which have been found in many other tumours, and codons 178 and 290, which have not been reported previously. All of the p53 proteins in which we detected point mutations were immunoprecipitated by the p53 monoclonal antibody PAb 240, which has been shown to recognize a mutant conformation of p53 protein. Thus, our results indicate that functional inactivation of the p53 gene by point mutational change might be one of the mechanisms underlying disease progression of AML",

    "Abstract": "The p53 gene was examined in primary lymphoblasts of 25 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia by the RNase protection assay and by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis in 23 of 25 cases. p53 mutations were found to occur, but at a low frequency (4 of 25). While all four mutations were identified by single strand conformation polymorphism, the comparative sensitivity of RNase protection was 50% (2 of 4). Heterozygosity was retained at mutated codons in 3 of 4 cases. One pedigree was consistent with the Li- Fraumeni syndrome, and bone marrow from both diagnosis and remission indicated a germline G to T transversion at codon 272 (valine to leucine). Although members of another family were affected with leukemia, a 2-bp deletion in exon 6 was nonhereditary. The other two nonhereditary p53 mutations included a T to G transversion at codon 270 (phenylalanine to cysteine) and a G to C transversion at codon 248 (arginine to proline). These data support the role of both hereditary and acquired p53 mutations in the pathogenesis and/or progression of some cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia",

    "Abstract": "The presence of point mutation of the p53 gene in exons 5, 6, 7, and 8 was examined in 10 cases of gastric adenocarcinoma and 5 cases of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by polymerase chain reaction and direct nucleotide sequencing. Mutations of the p53 gene were found in 5 cases of gastric cancer and 4 cases of esophageal cancer. The mutations in the stomach cancers consisted of four missence mutations (exons 5 and 8) and one frame shift (exon 7). In the esophageal cancers, three missence mutations (exons 6, 7, and 8) and one point mutation within the splice donor site of intron 5 were found. Of the seven missence mutations in the two cancers, five showed the transition from G to A and two from G to T. All these changes occurred in the highly conserved region of the p53 protein. These results suggest that mutations of the p53 gene are genetic events in the pathogenesis of gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma",

Only one of the 23 tumors (4.3%) carried a mutated p53 gene, which was present in exons 7- 8. Direct DNA sequencing confirmed a point mutation at codon 276 (GCC to CCC) resulting in a substitution of alanine for proline. No specific clinicopathological characteristics were observed in the case with the p53 gene mutation in human renal cell carcinoma. These observations suggest that mutation of the p53 gene is rare and thus does not contribute significantly to the genesis of this tumor",

    "Title": "High incidence of p53 gene mutation in human ovarian cancer and its association with nuclear accumulation of p53 protein and tumor DNA aneuploidy",
    "Abstract": "Using the polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, p53 gene mutations were examined in 24 cases of ovarian tumor including 14 ovarian carcinomas and 2 borderline cases of common epithelial type, 7 germ cell tumors, and one stromal tumor. Abnormal bands indicating mutations were detected in 12 (50%) of the cases examined, being present most frequently in common 'epithelial' ovarian carcinoma (71%, 10/14). One case each of squamous cell carcinoma originating in a dermoid cyst and anaplastic dysgerminoma were positive for mutation. Direct sequencing confirmed 12 mutations and revealed G-->A and G-->C nucleotide changes in 5 and 3 cases (42% and 25%), respectively. The mutation was localized at the CpG site of the gene in 3 cases. Immunohistochemical examination of p53 protein in 21 cases and DNA flow-cytometrical analysis in 17 cases were also performed. Nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein and DNA aneuploidy pattern were detected in 11 (52%) and 9 (53%) cases, respectively. These were significantly correlated with p53 gene mutation (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively; Fisher's exact test). Neither mutation of the p53 gene, nuclear accumulation of p53 protein nor DNA aneuploidy was detected in borderline cases of common 'epithelial' type, typical dysgerminoma and immature teratoma. These results suggest that p53 gene mutation, nuclear accumulation of the protein and the DNA aneuploidy pattern are events occurring almost simultaneously in the progression of ovarian tumors, and that p53 abnormalities seem to be correlated with a high grade of malignancy",

    "Abstract": "A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated RNase protection analysis was performed to detect subtle genetic alterations of p53 in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and pheochromocytoma. None of the 30 pheochromocytomas showed abnormal RNase protection patterns. Only one of 32 MTCs showed an abnormal pattern, and subsequent DNA sequencing of the PCR product revealed that it had a G to C transversion in codon 49 that resulted in a change from aspartic acid to histidine. However, this was a sporadic MTC with no specific clinicopathological characteristics. On the basis of a previous report that genes on chromosome 17p were not deleted in MTCs and were relatively infrequently deleted in pheochromocytomas, our results suggest that the p53 gene is not involved in tumorigenesis of MTC or pheochromocytoma",

    "Abstract": "The clinical and pathological significance of mutation of the p53 tumor- suppressor gene was examined in 108 cases of primary uterine cancers using single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct DNA sequencing analyses. Mutation of the p53 gene was detected in 19 (31%) of 62 cases of cancer of the uterine corpus and was more frequent in groups at an advanced clinical stage and/or with aggressive histology. Among four adenocarcinomas arising in the lowest portion of the uterine corpus, three showed integration of human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and/or 18 DNA, and two of them also showed p53 mutation. In cancer of the uterine cervix, p53 mutations were rare; 7% (3/46) in total, 3% (1/30) of cases with integration of HPV types 16 and/or 18 DNA and 13% (2/16) of cases without HPV DNA integration. Three mutations were detected among two cases at clinical stage IV and two cases of undifferentiated cervical carcinoma. Immunohistochemically, all five cases of uterine cancer which showed diffuse (> 50% of cancer cells) nuclear staining of p53 protein also carried the p53 mutation. Therefore, p53 alterations were suggested to be involved in the development of uterine cancers showing aggressive biological behavior. Although a high incidence of HPV DNA integration and a low incidence of p53 mutation were confirmed in cancer of the uterine cervix, there was no inverse association between integration of HPV types 16 and/or 18 DNA and p53 mutation",

A single base substitution was detected in 4 cases at codons 162, 175, 205 and 273 and a single base insertion in one case within codon 315. A high frequency of p53 mutations in ovarian cancers and lack of mutation in 6 benign ovarian tumors and 2 normal ovaries suggested that the mutation of the p53 gene was associated with the genesis and/or progression of ovarian cancer. In 1 of 7 endometrial cancers, two mutations at codons 239 and 254 were detected",

    "Abstract": "Anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid gland, which is one of the most aggressive, malignant tumors in humans, is considered to originate from preexisting differentiated thyroid cancer. To define the genetic alterations associated with such progression, we examined nine cases of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma for mutation in exons 4-9 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Preliminary screening for mutation by RNase protection analysis demonstrated that two out of nine anaplastic carcinomas contained sequence alterations in the p53 gene. Subsequent DNA sequencing identified the mutated nucleotides in these two cases; one was a nonsense mutation at codon 165, and the other was a single-base deletion at codon 176 resulting in the creation of a stop codon downstream due to frameshift. The fact that no mutations were detected in coexisting foci of papillary carcinomas from the same patients shows that these mutations of the p53 gene occurred after development of papillary carcinomas. These results suggest that p53 gene mutation triggers the progression from differentiated into anaplastic carcinoma in the human thyroid gland",

Mutations in the biopsy specimens were detected in 6 of the 12 aneuploid tumors but in none of the 4 diploid tumors. After tumor cell enrichment by cell sorting, one mutation in exon 8 became apparent, which could not be detected from the surgical specimen by a conventional method of PCR-SSCP analysis.

    "Title": "Pattern of p53 gene mutations in breast cancers of women of the midwestern United States",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mutation in the p53 gene is the most common genetic lesion in human cancers. The pattern of mutation in the p53 gene differs among cancers and may be a useful epidemiological tool for identification of factors contributing to carcinogenesis. PURPOSE: Our purpose was to determine if the pattern of p53 mutation in breast carcinomas in our population of women residing in the midwestern region of the United States is similar to the pattern of p53 mutation in breast cancers in patients from other regions of the United States and Europe and in other epithelial tumors. METHODS: With a technique we recently developed for the analysis of p53 mutations in genomic DNA from tumor cell clusters in touch preparations of solid tumors, we sequenced exons 5-9 and adjacent splice junctions of the gene in 44 breast cancers. Cells from each tumor were also stained with three monoclonal antibodies which recognize different epitopes of the p53 protein. RESULTS: We detected p53 mutations in 14 (32.6%) of 44 breast carcinomas. Only half of the mutations were missense changes. The other half included five microdeletions (three producing frame-shifts), one single-base substitution generating a stop codon, and one single-base substitution generating a splice junction abnormality. Nuclear expression of p53 antigen was present in eight of 44 cancers, including six with hemizygous missense mutations in the p53 gene. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of p53 mutations in our breast cancer population differs from that reported in breast cancer populations by other investigators in which most p53 mutations were missense. Among 14 mutations in our population, at least five drastically altered the structure of p53, suggesting that a recessive mechanism of inactivation of the p53 gene may be more common than in other populations. IMPLICATIONS: Differences in the pattern of p53 mutation in breast cancers in Midwestern women and in breast cancers in other populations may reflect selection bias or small sample sizes currently available. However, our data are compatible with the possibility that an endogenous or exogenous factor influences p53 carcinogenesis in some women with breast cancer in the Midwest to a greater extent than in other regions of the United States and Europe",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 have been identified in breast cancer cell lines, and some breast carcinomas are detectable by immunohistochemical assay because of p53 protein accumulation. PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine whether p53 protein accumulation in breast cancers correlates with p53 gene mutation, with survival, and with five pathobiologic factors associated with prognosis. METHODS: IgG1 monoclonal antibody to human p53 protein (PAb 1801) and immunohistochemical methods were used to detect p53 protein accumulation in archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, randomly selected carcinomas. We studied 295 invasive ductal carcinomas from the Massachusetts General Hospital; 151 were determined to be sporadic (not hereditary). We also studied 97 invasive ductal carcinomas--21 sporadic and 76 familial (hereditary)--from Creighton University. In addition, we examined 31 archival in situ carcinomas, 15 snap-frozen invasive ductal carcinomas, primary cell cultures from three benign breast tissue samples, and breast carcinoma cell lines MDA- MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. RESULTS: Nuclear p53 protein was observed in 16% of the 31 in situ carcinomas, 22% of the 172 sporadic carcinomas, 34% of the 50 tumors from patients with familial breast cancer, 52% of the 23 tumors from patients with the familial breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, and all three tumors from two patients with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. There was complete concordance between p53 gene mutation and p53 protein accumulation in the 15 snap-frozen carcinomas and in both breast carcinoma cell lines. Statistically significant associations of p53 protein accumulation with estrogen receptor negativity and with high nuclear grade were found. There were statistically significant associations, independent of other prognostic factors, between p53 protein accumulation and metastasis-free and overall survival, for randomly accrued and for both sporadic and familial tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemically detected p53 protein accumulation was an independent marker of shortened survival and was seen more often in familial than in sporadic carcinomas. Our findings also suggest a correlation between p53 protein accumulation and p53 gene mutation",

    "Title": "Molecular genetic studies of tumor suppressor gene regions on chromosomes 13 and 17 in colorectal tumors",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the majority of colorectal carcinomas, both copies of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 (tumor protein 53) are known to be inactivated. In contrast to a loss of tumor suppressor function, it has been suggested that an increased copy number of the RB1 gene is involved in the progression of these tumors. PURPOSE: To determine genetic alterations at chromosomes 13 and 17 in colorectal tumors, we have studied several loci on these chromosomes, with special focus on the RB1 and TP53 genes at both the level of DNA sequence and the level of gene expression. METHODS: Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed after alkaline Southern blotting of the DNA fragments and hybridization (in 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.5 M NaPO4) of the nylon membranes with multiprimed, radioactively labeled probes. Total RNA was extracted from tissue biopsy specimens by homogenization of the samples in guanidinium thiocyanate followed by separation in a CsCl gradient. By use of an image-processing system, x- ray film signals were measured densitometrically. Point mutations within the TP53 gene were detected by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in combination with constant denaturant gel electrophoresis. Direct sequencing of PCR products revealed the exact nature of the mutations. Protein expression of TP53 was seen by immunostaining of sections from paraffin-embedded material using a mouse monoclonal antibody. The two-sided Fisher's Exact Test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: An increase in allelic copy number at 13q loci was seen in 10 (32%) of 31 tumors. In the majority of the cases, this increase probably reflected a change in the diploid status of chromosome 13; in some cases, however, only part of the 13q seemed to be involved. The RB1 gene showed an elevated level of RNA compared with the beta-actin signal. Fourteen (48%) of 29 tumors showed loss of heterozygosity at loci on 17p, and base mutations within the TP53 gene were seen in 14 (42%) of 33 tumors. RNA and protein analyses of TP53 revealed an increased level of expression in the tumors compared with normal mucosa. Allelic variations seen at 13q and 17p were not associated (P = .7). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, in addition to aneuploidy, gain of specific chromosome 13 sequences is involved in the tumorigenesis of the colon and rectum. In addition, they confirm the importance of TP53 mutations for the progression of such tumors and support the view that accumulation of events is more important than the order of events. The genetic changes observed at chromosome arms 13q and 17p seem to be independent of each other",

    "Abstract": "A patient with bilateral retinoblastoma and subsequent multiple primary osteosarcomas has been described previously. Osteosarcoma cell lines established from this patient were shown to express a shortened RB1 mRNA transcript and no detectable normal Rb protein. We now show that the osteosarcoma cell lines have lost one TP53 allele and contain a mutation in exon 8 codon 286 [GAA to AAA (Glu to Lys)] in the remaining allele. Consequently, the osteosarcoma cell lines have no normal Rb protein and no normal p53 protein. Neither constitutional DNA nor DNA extracted from a retinoblastoma of the left eye of the patient contained the TP53 mutation, suggesting that the TP53 mutation in the osteosarcoma cells may represent a tumor-promoting mutation, which confers a selective growth advantage. If both RB1 and TP53 are involved in the initiation of osteosarcoma, the mechanisms for development of the retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma tumors are different",

    "Title": "Immune response to p53 is dependent upon p53/HSP70 complexes in breast cancers",
    "Abstract": "Overexpression of the p53 protein, resulting from gene mutations that increase protein stability, has been detected in greater than 25% of primary human breast cancers. In addition, approximately 10% of breast cancer patients have circulating antibodies to the p53 protein. In this study, the anti-p53 humoral response is correlated with the presence and type of mutant p53 protein expressed in the tumor. In a series of 60 breast cancer patients, 0 of 30 tumors with normal, low-level p53 expression induced anti-p53 antibodies, whereas 7 (23%) of 30 tumors with p53 overexpression elicited a specific anti-p53 antibody response. These 7 patients had anti-p53 antibodies that recognized wild-type p53 and a variety of mutant p53 proteins. A comparison of p53 mutations revealed that antibody-negative tumors had mutations exclusively in exons 7 and 8, whereas antibody-positive tumors had mutations primarily in exons 5 and 6. Moreover, all antibody-eliciting tumors contained complexes between p53 and a 70-kDa heat shock protein, whereas none of the antibody-negative tumors contained this complex. This study implicates a 70-kDa heat shock protein in the antigenic presentation of p53",

    "Title": "Two distinct mechanisms alter p53 in breast cancer: mutation and nuclear exclusion",
    "Abstract": "Twenty-seven cases of inflammatory breast cancer were screened for the presence of the p53 protein by immunocytochemical methods using a monoclonal antibody directed against the p53 protein. Three groups were detected: 8 cases (30%) had high levels of p53 in the nucleus of the cancer cells; 9 cases (33%) had a complete lack of detectable staining; 10 cases (37%) showed a pattern of cytoplasmic staining with nuclear sparing. Nucleotide sequence analysis of p53 cDNAs derived from the samples with cytoplasmic staining revealed only wild-type p53 alleles in 6 out of 7 cases. An eighth case was determined to be wild type by a single-strand conformation polymorphism. In contrast, the samples containing nuclear p53 contained a variety of missense mutations and a nonsense mutation. The p53 cDNAs from 3 of the tumors that lacked detectable p53 staining were analyzed, and all 3 had wild-type nucleotide sequences. Interestingly, a case of normal lactating breast tissue also showed intense cytoplasmic staining for p53 with nuclear sparing. These data suggest that some breast cancers that contain the wild-type form of p53 protein may inactivate its tumor-suppressing activity by sequestering this protein in the cytoplasm, away from its site of action in the cell nucleus. The detection of cytoplasmic p53 in normal lactating breast tissue could suggest that this is the mechanism employed in specific physiological situations to permit transient cell proliferation. This observation could explain how some breast cancer tissues inactivate p53 function without mutation",

    "Title": "An infrequent point mutation of the p53 gene in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Point mutations in the p53 gene have been detected in a variety of human cancers; the mutations are clustered in four 'hot-spots' located in the coding region of exons 5, 7, and 8, which coincide with the four most highly conserved regions of the gene. We report the finding of a heterozygous G----C mutation at codon 280 (exon 8), position 2, of the p53 gene in a nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell line, originating from Guangdong, a province in the People's Republic of China that leads the world in NPC incidence. A survey of nasopharyngeal tissues and NPC biopsies revealed that 1 out of 12 NPC samples from Hunan, another province in the People's Republic of China with high NPC incidence, had the same heterozygous mutation at codon 280 of p53, and none of 10 biopsies from Taiwan showed a mutation within exons 5-8 of the p53 gene. No other alteration of gene structure, including gross rearrangement or loss of heterozygosity or abnormality of gene expression was detected in NPC cell lines or NPC biopsies. We conclude from this study that mutational or other alterations of the p53 gene are not common in nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis and that a codon-280 mutation of p53 may be involved in less than 10% of NPC cases. This result contrasts with the relatively high frequency of p53 mutations associated with several other human carcinomas and suggests the importance of other genes in NPC genesis",

    "Title": "Low frequency of p53 mutations observed in a diverse collection of primary hepatocellular carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Recent studies of the p53 tumor suppressor locus (designated TP53) in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) have identified a high frequency of codon 249 mutations. Due to the geographic location from which the samples were obtained and the substitution observed, the mutation was suggested to be attributable to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) exposure. To determine the generality of this phenomenon, we have examined PHC tissues from 107 geographically and ethnically diverse sources. The frequency of p53 gene mutations was evaluated by using PCR/restriction- digest methods, GC-clamp (G+C-rich sequence) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequencing. The mutation rate observed in tumors from high-AFB1-exposure regions (25%) was more than double the rate observed in low-exposure regions (12%) but lower than the 50% frequency previously reported. Codon 249 mutations occurred at a much lower frequency than previously reported (2 of 107 samples examined). These results suggest that changes in DNA encoding p53 may not represent primary oncogenic effects but instead represent genetic changes related to tumor progression. High AFB1 levels may facilitate the generation of these progressional changes, but not by inducing a specific p53 gene mutation at codon 249 as previously reported",

    "Title": "Missense mutations and a deletion of the p53 gene in human gastric cancer",
    "Abstract": "To investigate the molecular pathogenesis of human gastric cancers the p53 gene, a suppressor oncogene, was analyzed in 12 human gastric cell lines. Southern blot and Northern blot analysis revealed a total deletion of p53 gene in KATO-III cells but no major abnormality of p53 gene in other cell lines. By the use of the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing 7 cell lines showed point mutations of p53 gene resulting in amino-acid substitutions. Most of them were rare mutations which had not been observed in other types of cancers. One of these mutations was also detected through the use of PCR and oligomer-specific hybridization. Six out of 7 cell lines with mutations of p53 gene also lost one allele of chromosome 17p. Immunoblotting of cell lysates with an antibody specific to p53 demonstrated the absence of p53 protein in KATO-III cell. By contrast, the high levels of the p53 protein were observed in 5 cell lines all of which contained mutations of p53 gene. These results further suggest that the inactivation of p53 gene may play an important role in the transformation of gastric cells to the malignant phenotype. KATO-III cells might be a good model for studying the significance of the loss of p53 gene in cellular transformation",

Somatic mutations resulting in amino acid changes were found in eight of the 18 cases (44%). Seven missense mutations were located in amino acid-conserved domains or their vicinities (codons 110 to 307). Most mutations were found at G-C pairs, suggesting that specific carcinogens are involved in the etiology of lung cancer. The p53 mutations showed a significant association with a history of smoking (P = 0.0294). We suggest that the p53 mutations may be associated with smoking-induced lung carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "p53 mutation is associated with progression in follicular lymphomas",
    "Abstract": "The majority of low-grade follicular lymphomas will eventually transform to an aggressive intermediate, or high-grade lymphoma. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this transformation have not been determined. We studied serial biopsies from 34 patients with follicular lymphomas that underwent histologic transformation, for abnormalities of the p53 tumor suppressor gene by a combination of immunohistochemistry, single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP), and sequencing. We found overexpression of p53 in 10 of the 34 transformed aggressive lymphomas, 9 of which contained mutations identified by SSCP analysis and subsequent sequencing. Matched pretransformation low-grade follicular lymphoma biopsies were available for 7 of the 10 cases. None of six studied by immunohistochemistry showed overexpression of p53 and only 1 of 4 studied by SSCP/sequencing showed the presence of mutation in the pretransformation biopsy. Interestingly, an eighth p53 positive transformed lymphoma recurred with a clonally related, p53 negative low-grade lymphoma 5 years after the patient had achieved a complete remission. Immunohistochemistry also showed that several pretransformation biopsies from p53 positive transformed cases showed rare p53 positive cells and in one case we could document an increase in their number over time. Twenty-five additional low-grade follicular lymphoma biopsies were also examined. Three patients had lymphomas positive for p53 mutation. One of the three subsequently transformed within a year of the biopsy studied; the second patient had an earlier (unavailable) biopsy at a different site that showed transformed histology. The third patient was treated with ProMACE-MOPP combination chemotherapy and attained a complete remission. We conclude that (1) mutations of p53 are associated with histologic transformation in approximately 25% to 30% of follicular lymphomas and (2) p53 positive cells can be detected before histologic transformation, but do not comprise a significant percentage of the neoplastic cell population (identifiable by SSCP) until late in the disease, just before or after histologic progression. Finally, the data also suggest that p53 positive low-grade lymphomas are at risk for progression and that in this subset, aggressive therapy may be warranted",

    "Title": "p53 mutations are associated with histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "The majority of low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) undergo clinical progression toward intermediate- and high-grade lymphomas. This progression is often associated with histologic transformation from follicular to diffuse-type NHL. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying this evolution are presently unknown. In this study, we have analyzed the role in NHL progression of relevant genetic lesions affecting proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Sequential biopsies from 21 patients with clinical progression with (5 cases) or without (16 cases) evidence of histologic transformation were analyzed for karyotypic changes, c-myc rearrangements and deletions affecting 6q27 by Southern blot analysis, and p53 mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis coupled with direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified products. No novel cytogenetic aberration was detected in association with progression, and all samples analyzed displayed a normal c-myc gene. Mutations of the p53 gene were detected in 4 of 5 cases displaying histologic transformation from follicular to diffuse-type NHL and in none of the 16 cases displaying clinical progression in the absence of histologic transformation. In 1 of these positive cases, the same mutation was also present in the pretransformation biopsy, correlating with the presence of diffuse-type areas within a predominant follicular pattern. In 1 of these cases, a deletion of 6q27 was also detected in the posttransformation biopsy along with a p53 mutation. These findings indicate that p53 mutations are associated with and may be responsible for histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma",

    "Title": "Mutation and protein expression of p53 in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related lymphomas",
    "Abstract": "p53 mutations are found in a variety of neoplasia. B-immunoblastic lymphoma (BIBL) is a rapidly progressive, aggressive lymphoma. As patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) live longer, BIBL is becoming an increasing problem. We asked three questions in our study. What is the frequency of p53 mutations in BIBL? Is it more frequent in patients with AIDS? Can immunohistochemical staining of lymph nodes for expression of p53 substitute for mutational analysis of p53 to detect lymphomas with mutated p53? Exons 5, 6, 7, 8 of the p53 gene (hot-spots for mutations) were amplified and examined for mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Altered migration was observed in 7 of 52 BIBL samples. Of these, 4 of 25 were from individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 3 of 27 were not infected with HIV. Direct sequencing of amplified material confirmed the presence of mutations in exons 5, 7, 8 of p53. A total of 26 BIBL as well as other lymphoma/leukemia samples, stained strongly by immunohistochemistry with three antibodies directed against human p53. Five of 6 BIBL samples with p53 mutations stained strongly for p53, but 20 lymphoma samples with no detectable p53 mutations also stained strongly for p53. Of note, however, 10 hyperplastic, nonmalignant lymph nodes from individuals either infected or not infected with HIV had negligible staining for p53 protein. In conclusion, p53 mutations occur in about 14% BIBL samples; the frequency of p53 mutations in BIBL in individuals with and without AIDS was similar. Positive p53 immunohistochemistry did not correlate with detectable p53 mutations in the same tissue, but positive immunohistochemical staining for p53 was only found in neoplastic lymph nodes. This latter finding provides a strong warning that p53 immunochemistry with available reagents cannot be used to determine which tumors have mutations of p53",

    "Abstract": "The p53 gene is currently thought to be a tumor suppressor gene, and its alterations have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of several human malignancies, including some leukemias and lymphomas. We present here evidence for the possible involvement of p53 gene mutations in the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), although the incidence is relatively low. Forty-four patients with MDS and six patients with overt leukemias that developed from MDS were studied for p53 gene alterations using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and nucleotide sequencing. Three patients with MDS (2 RAEB and 1 RAEB in T) had missense point mutations in the conserved regions of the p53 coding sequence. Furthermore, expression of the wild-type p53 mRNA was not detected in these three patients. The probable absence of normal p53 function in the three cases studied here suggests that alterations in the p53 gene may occasionally play a role in MDS. These three MDS patients with p53 gene mutations and an MDS-derived erythroleukemia cell line that we had previously reported to carry a p53 gene mutation showed no N-ras gene mutations, suggesting heterogeneity in the oncogenic mechanism of MDS",

    "Abstract": "We have used a single-cell based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification technique to examine the gene expression pattern in single Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg (H&RS) cells from seven patients with Hodgkin's disease. Single cells were isolated from lymph nodes obtained at diagnosis (5 of 7 patients) or in first or second relapse (2 of 7 patients). Gene expression was examined by hybridization to a panel of 22 cDNA probes. Forty-nine H&RS cells (and 23 CD3+ or CD20+ lymphocytes as controls) from four patients with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease (HD) and one patient each with lymphocyte predominant and mixed-cellularity HD were successfully analyzed by PCR. This analysis provides evidence that single H&RS cells can coexpress genes characteristic of several hematopoietic lineages (monocytes and lymphocytes). Genes characteristic of activated lymphoid cells are expressed in most H&RS cells. Heterogeneity of expression for certain genes between different cases was found and may eventually define molecular subgroups of HD. These findings indicate that H&RS cells of HD resemble activated hematopoietic cells. Phenotypically similar cells from different cases exhibit characteristic molecular differences. In one patient, 5 of 7 single RS cells showed identical p53 cDNA mutations at codon 246 on specific reverse transcriptase [RT]-PCR and sequencing of exons 5 through 8. The novel experimental approach may provide a valuable tool for understanding the molecular events in newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease and progression of the disease",

The K051 and K052 were established from the patient's bone marrow cells at diagnosis and at relapse, respectively. The K051 cell expressed myeloid- associated antigens (CD13 and CD33), a platelet-associated antigen (CD41), and an erythroid antigen (glycophorin A). The K052 cell expressed myeloid-associated antigens (CD13, CD14, and CD33), lymphoid markers (CD2, CD5, and CD7), and HLA-DR. Chromosome analysis of both cell lines showed a 17p- chromosome. Both cell lines were investigated for aberrations of the p53 gene and the N-ras gene. A p53 mutation detected in both cell lines consisted of a C-->T substitution in codon 248. An N-ras mutation detected only in the K052 cell consisted of a G-- >C substitution in codon 13. Expression of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) was also investigated by the semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). MDR1-mRNA was more highly expressed by the K052 cell than the K051 cell, being equivalent to that in HEL cells. The functional MDR1-protein against vincristine was also observed, and its function was inhibited by verapamile and Cyclosporin A. The K052 cells were capable of phenotypic or morphologic differentiation after being incubated with granulocyte colony- stimulating factor, interleukin-2, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3. In contrast, the K051 cells responded phenotypically to retinoic acid. Thus, the K051 and K052 cell lines will be useful for investigating the cellular and molecular events in leukemogenesis and differentiation, and the mechanism of expression of the MDR1 gene",

    "Abstract": "We studied 53 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and found mutations of the p53 gene in 15%. Patients with p53 gene mutations were found to have an aggressive form of B-CLL disease characterized by advanced Rai stage, rapid lymphocyte doubling time (LDT), and resistance to chemotherapy. While 27 of 29 treated patients (93%) without p53 mutations achieved a partial remission, only one of seven treated patients (14%) with p53 mutations achieved a partial remission (P = .00009). Adjusting for prognostic factors (age, sex, race, and Rai stage), patients with p53 gene mutations had a 13-fold greater risk of death than patients without p53 mutations (P = .013). In addition to examining the clinical relevance of p53 gene mutations in B-CLL, we investigated the possible role of p53 gene regulation in the expression of the multidrug resistance genes MDR1 and MDR3. We quantitated MDR1 and MDR3 mRNA expression by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Expression of both the MDR1 and MDR3 genes was independent of p53 gene mutation or prior drug treatment, and did not predict for clinical response. Our findings indicate that p53 gene mutations in B-CLL are associated with a poor clinical outcome and may be a prognostic indicator for drug resistance",

    "Abstract": "p53 overexpression has been found to be a fairly common feature in high grade lymphomas in the majority of tumoral cells. The results vary from series to series, from 25% to 33% of cases. To assess whether immunohistochemical positivity for p53 correlated with the presence of structural gene abnormalities, DNA from 16 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with high and low p53 values was amplified and sequenced to determine the existence of point mutations in the highly conserved regions of the p53 gene. In the group of 8 cases containing high levels of protein, 3 cases showed missense point mutations at the codons mapping between exons 5 through 8. Of the 8 cases of tumors containing undetectable or low levels of p53 protein, 1 case presented a nonsense point mutation giving a stop codon. No missense mutations were detected in this group. The finding of p53 mutations in 4 of 16 cases confirms the presence of p53 gene mutations in high grade lymphomas distributed over different histologic groups. These include Burkitt's lymphoma, together with centroblastic, immunoblastic, and large cell lymphoma of mucosa origin. Nevertheless, the absence of mutations in 5 of the 8 cases that overexpressed p53 suggests that the nuclear or cytoplasmic stabilization of p53 protein could also depend on other factors. The absence of detectable levels of p53 protein cannot discount the existence of p53 mutations, as is shown by a case of Burkitt's lymphoma in which a nonsense mutation was detected. The impact of this range of p53 alterations on clinical course and treatment response of the patients deserves to be explored, in an attempt to differentiate the specific consequences of each one",

    "Abstract": "p53 mutations are found in a wide variety of cancers, including hematologic malignancies. These alterations apparently contribute to development of the malignant phenotype. We analyzed a large series of lymphoid (330 cases) and a smaller series of myeloid (29 cases) malignancies of childhood for p53 mutations by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) following polymerase chain reaction. Samples with abnormal SSCP were reamplified and analyzed by direct sequencing method. p53 mutations were detected within the known mutational hotspots (exons 5 to 8) in 8 of 330 lymphoid malignancies, and in none of 29 myeloid malignancies, showing that the frequency of p53 mutations in childhood lymphoid malignancies was very low (8 of 330 cases [2%]). Four of these patients had very aggressive, fatal acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). None of 13 infants and none of 48 patients with T-lineage leukemia had detectable p53 mutations in their ALL cells. Exceptionally, p53 mutations were comparatively frequent in a small sample of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (2 of 8 cases). Mutations were detected in samples from two patients with ALL at relapse; these were not detected in samples at initial diagnosis from the same patients, suggesting that p53 mutations may be associated with progression to a more malignant phenotype. Seven of eight alterations of p53 were missense mutations, and seven of eight samples may be heterozygous for the mutant p53, indicating that p53 protein may act in a dominant negative fashion",

DNAs were analyzed for p53 gene mutations in exons 5 to 9 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and direct sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments. Point mutations were detected in 7 of 52 patients (13%) (5 at exon 8; 1 at exon 6; 1 at exon 7), and were specifically associated with the more advanced and clinically aggressive acute/leukemic forms of MM (7 of 16 [43%].) Three of the mutated cases had been evaluated at clinical presentation in earlier phases of the disease (indolent or chronic) and were found to be negative for p53 mutation. Moreover, three patients with p53 mutation had not received chemotherapy at the time of investigation. These results support the notion that the development of MM is a multistep process and suggest that alterations in the p53 gene may represent an important late event in MM tumor progression",

    "Abstract": "We demonstrated the feasibility of detection of p53 gene mutations in bronchial biopsy samples from patients with lung cancer. Following DNA extraction from two to three pieces of bronchial tissue obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy, p53 gene mutations were screened using polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. We examined four bronchial biopsy specimens from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and detected one point mutation at codon 130 (C to G, Leu to Val). This technique will be very useful for studies on early detection of lung cancers or for an analysis of a suspected premalignant lesion. Furthermore, this technique enables us to know the status of oncogene or tumor suppressor gene at the time of diagnosis, which may be very useful for a treatment of patients with cancer in the not too distant future",

    "Title": "Mutations of p53 and human papillomavirus infection in cervical carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cervical carcinoma. The HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 are though to play a crucial role in this process by their interactions with the p53 protein and the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, respectively. The E6 protein binds to and stimulates the degradation of the p53 protein. Mutations involving evolutionary conserved regions of the p53 gene also can alter p53 function. Point mutations of p53 frequently have been identified in a wide variety of human tumors. METHODS. Forty-five cervical carcinoma samples were evaluated for the presence of mutations involving exons 5-8 of the p53 gene with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA, followed by single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis and/or direct sequencing. The status of oncogenic HPV infection in the tumor tissues was analyzed by Southern blot and PCR. RESULTS. Forty-two of 45 cervical carcinomas showed oncogenic HPV DNA. Of three HPV-negative samples, one harbored a missense point mutation of the p53 gene. An additional p53 point mutations was identified in a tumor with HPV 18 infection. CONCLUSIONS. Oncogenic HPV DNA can be identified in most cervical carcinomas. Mutations involving conserved regions of p53, although infrequent in cervical cancer, occur preferentially in tumors without HPV infection. Inactivation of p53 function is important in the pathogenesis of cervical carcinoma",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations and 17p allelic deletions in hepatocellular carcinoma from Japan",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. p53 gene mutations at codon 249 have been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from China and South Africa, a phenomenon shown to be closely associated with food contamination by aflatoxin. There have been few reports, however, in regard to p53 gene mutations in HCC from other geographic areas. METHODS. The authors analyzed 20 HCC from Japan for alteration of the p53 gene by restriction fragment length polymorphisms and for nucleic acid mutations by polymerase chain reaction with direct sequencing. RESULTS. Alterations associated with the p53 gene were found in 6 of 20 HCC (30%). Allelic loss of chromosome 17p occurred in 5 of 14 informative (heterozygous) cases (36%). Mutations in the p53 gene were detected in three cases (15%), at codons 176 (exon 5), 236 (exon 7), and 294 (exon 8). These cases were different from the HCC cases from China and South Africa, where point mutations in the p53 gene were reported at the same codon 249 in half of the cases and where aflatoxin food contamination and hepatitis B virus infection are recognized risk factors of HCC. No p53 gene alterations were found in smaller HCC (< 3 cm) or at earlier stages. CONCLUSIONS. In Japan, p53 gene alterations seem to be a late event in the progression of hepatocarcinogenesis, which is often associated with persistent infection by the hepatitis C or B virus, but not usually with exposure to aflatoxin",

    "Title": "p53 gene alterations in human prostate carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Alterations of the p53 gene are among the most frequent genetic lesions in a variety of human malignancies. Their role in prostate cancer is, however, unclear. We have analyzed 10 primary and two metastatic human prostate carcinomas as well as 3 prostate cancer cell lines for mutations of the p53-gene. Using single strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP) and direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, p53 mutations were detected in 1 of 10 primary prostate cancers. By contrast, 1 of 2 metastatic tumors and all 3 prostate cancer cell lines (derived from metastases) were found to contain a mutant p53 gene. Thus, our data suggest that alterations of the p53 gene at the mutational 'hot spots' appear to occur infrequently in primary human prostate cancer, but may emerge in later stages of tumor progression. Furthermore, we confirm that loss of heterozygosity at a locus telomeric to p53, but not including p53, is associated with metastatic progression in 1 case",

Sites of mutations were in exon 5 (codon 141), exon 7 (codon 238, codon 258) and exon 8 (codon 270). The present study suggested that mutation of the p53 gene is involved in the development of human testicular seminoma as in the case of several other types of human cancers.",

We sequenced the conserved regions of the p53 tumour suppressor gene in lung cancers from 17 non-smokers from Hiroshima, Japan; 9 were atomic-bomb survivors. The mutations were predominantly transitions (all G:C to A:T); there were no G:C to T:A transversions. By contrast, lung cancers from 77 Japanese smokers have a predominance of G:C to T:A transversions in which the guanine residues occur on the non-transcribed DNA strand.

Polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies generated against peptides homologous to COOH-terminal and leucine-zipper domains of the retinoblastoma protein allowed us to identify two cell lines (Hep 3B and FOCUS) with abnormal expression. The same cell lines have both lacked p53 expression. In contrast to the retinoblastoma gene, the expression of the p53 gene was abnormal in six additional cell lines. Indeed, only the Hep G2 hepatoblastoma cell line (and its derivative Hep G2/2215) appeared to have normal p53 and retinoblastoma gene expression. Our studies indicate that p53 abnormalities are common but retinoblastoma gene aberrations are rare in human hepatoma cell lines",

    "Title": "Genetic alterations of the TP53 gene, p53 protein expression and HPV infection in primary cervical carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Primary cervical carcinomas from 92 patients were investigated for genetic alterations in the tumour suppressor gene TP53. Studies of allelic imbalance (AI) were performed by Southern blot analysis and by using two PCR (polymerase chain reaction) polymorphisms within the TP53 gene. AI in the tumour was observed in 22 per cent (11 of 52 informative patients) and was significantly associated with recurrence both in a univariate (P = 0.013) and in a multivariate (P = 0.045) analysis. The DNA samples were subjected to mutation analysis of four of the conserved domains in the TP53 gene, using PCR followed by constant denaturant gel electrophoresis (CDGE). Mutations were observed in 2 of 92 tumours (2 per cent), of which one was a silent mutation and the other a frameshift. Overexpression of the p53 protein was found by immunostaining of sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material in 55 per cent (51/92) of the tumours. In 88 per cent (45/51) of these, overexpression was present in less than 5 per cent of the tumour cells. Overexpression was significantly associated with relapse- free survival only in a univariate analysis (P = 0.045). AI of the TP53 locus did not correlate with p53 expression or mutation. The important gene on 17p, responsible for the shorter disease-free survival for patients with AI of TP53, may therefore be another gene closely linked to TP53. In addition, the 92 tumour samples were tested for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. Fifty-four per cent (50/92) of the samples were positive for HPV 16 using in situ hybridization, and 93 per cent (86/92) using the PCR technique. The numbers for HPV 18 were 15 per cent (14/92) and 23 per cent (21/92), respectively. Twenty-one per cent (19/92) were positive for both HPV 16 and HPV 18, while 4 per cent (4/92) were negative for both HPV 16 and 18. The tumour with the frameshift TP53 mutation was HPV 16-positive, and the four samples negative for HPV 16 and 18 did not contain TP53 mutations within the conserved domains but had elevated p53 protein expression",

    "Abstract": "A new human pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (KMO-90) was established from the bone marrow sample of a 12-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) carrying 1;19 chromosome translocation. KMO-90 cells expressed HLA-DR, CD10, CD19, and CD22 antigens. These cells had also cytoplasmic immunoglobulin lacking surface immunoglobulin, indicating that these had a pre-B phenotype. Chromosome analysis of this cell line showed 48, XX, +8, +19, t(1;19)(q23;p13). Southern blot analysis showed the same sized rearrangements of the E2A gene in KMO-90 cells as those in the original leukemic cells. By means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, we detected E2A/PBX1 fusion transcripts in KMO-90 cells. KMO-90 is useful when studying the role of the 1;19 translocation in the etiology of pre-B ALL. Furthermore, we studied alterations of the p53 gene in this cell line by polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. KMO-90 cells were identified to have a point mutation at codon 177 (CCC-->TCC) of the p53 gene, suggesting that alterations of the p53 gene may have an important role in the establishment of this cell line",

    "Abstract": "The recent finding that eight out of 10 multiple myeloma cell lines have p53 gene mutations prompted us to examine the p53 tumour suppressor gene in 25 non-related multiple myeloma patients. Noen of 19 patients bone marrow samples available for Southern blot analysis showed rearrangements in the p53 gene and only one patient showed loss of the p53 locus.  DNA encompassing exons 5, 7, and 8, where p53 mutations commonly cluster, was amplified by PCR.  Single-strand cofnormation polymorphisms of the PCR-amplified exon 5 region were detected in two patients.  Direct sequencing of the mutant band revealed that one patient had a C to T transition at codon 138 (Ala to Val) ando ne patient had a G to C transversion at codon 139 (Lys to Asn).  p53 mutations in germline cells in hereditary cancer syndromes predispose the family members to the development of malignancies.  We therefore searched for p53 germline mutationsi n exons 5, 7, and 8 in the affected idnividuals from theree families each with two multiple myeloma patients (these patients include three individuals from the non-related group mentioend above).  Using southern blotting, polymerase chain reaction/single-strand cofnormation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing, no germline mutations were found.  These resutls indicate that mutations in exons 5, 7, and 8 of the p53 gene are infrequent in multiple myeloma.",

    "Abstract": "Rearrangements of the c-abl protooncogene and the bcr-gene are found in > 90% of patients in chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The molecular events leading to blast crisis, however, have not been well characterized. Gross alterations of the p53 gene have been detected in 30% of patients with blast crisis. Since point mutations in the p53 gene appear to be important in the process of transformation in many epithelial tumors, we looked for these mutations in the critical regions of the p53 gene (exons 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct sequencing, differential PCR, and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis to detect mutations of the p53 gene in samples from 21 patients with CML blast crisis. Two of 21 patients exhibited an intragenic deletion or rearrangement in p53. In addition, these patients were homozygous for the mutant p53 allele. No mutations were found in the p53 gene of the remaining 19 patients. However, sequencing of the CML blast crisis cell line, K562, revealed an insertion of a C at base position 956 within the fifth exon, causing a frame shift mutation and an early translational stop at codon 148. We conclude that, in contrast to solid tumors, mutations in exons 4-8 of p53 are not frequently seen in primary samples from CML blast crisis. However, deletions and/or rearrangements within the p53 gene do occur and may contribute to the progression from chronic phase to blast crisis in a limited number of patients with CML",

    "Abstract": "We screened 23 cases of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive acute leukemia (Ph1AL) for loss of a chromosome 17p and mutations in exons 2 to 11 of the p53 gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. Loss of a distal part of chromosome 17p including loss of a whole chromosome 17 emerged in three cases, among which two were Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph1ALL) with point mutations within the highly conserved region of the p53 gene. Another case of Ph1-positive acute myelogenous leukemia (Ph1AML) also exhibited a p53 point mutation in company with loss of normal p53 allele, although showing normal chromosome 17 homologues. We also performed Southern blot hybridization analysis to examine p53 gene rearrangements in 13 cases of Ph1AL. We found a rearrangement in one case of Ph1ALL and a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the p53 locus without any rearrangement in another Ph1ALL. Both cases showed no abnormality within the entire coding region by SSCP analysis. Thus, p53 gene alterations were commonly involved in Ph1AL with loss of a 17p (two point mutations in three cases), while rarely in cases with normal chromosome 17s (one point mutation in 20 cases and one rearrangement in 13 cases). Rare p53 gene alterations in Ph1AL may therefore be related to low incidence of loss of a chromosome 17p",

Twenty-five samples were studied in the chronic phase, while seven samples were analyzed in the acute accelerated or blastic phase. The presence of mutations in p53 exons 5-9, as well as in N-, K-, H-Ras exons 1 and 2 (containing codons 12, 13, and 61) was tested by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single strand conformation polymorphism technique and by PCR direct sequencing. In addition, restriction analysis was performed to screen for gross rearrangements within the p53 locus. Alterations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and Ras family proto-oncogenes were detected in 2/7 and 3/7 cases of acute phase BCR/ABL-negative CMPD, respectively, while consistently negative in all the chronic phase samples analyzed. These results suggest that p53 inactivation and/or Ras activation might play a role in acute transformation of BCR/ABL- negative CMPD",

    "Title": "In vitro establishment of AIDS-related lymphoma cell lines: phenotypic characterization, oncogene and tumor suppressor gene lesions, and heterogeneity in Epstein-Barr virus infection",
    "Abstract": "Lymphoma represents a major source of morbidity and mortality among AIDS patients. AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin lymphomas (AIDS-NHL) are almost invariably B-cell derived, are classified as high or intermediate grade lymphomas, and display three main histologic types: namely, small non-cleaved cell lymphoma (SNCCL), large cell immunoblastic plasmacytoid lymphoma (LC-IBPL), and large cell lymphoma (LCL). Here we report the in vitro establishment of three new AIDS-NHL cell lines (termed HBL-1, HBL-2, and HBL-3) derived from three AIDS-SNCCL patients differing in primary tumor sites and risk factors for HIV infection. The derivation of the cell lines from the original tumor clones was established by immunophenotypic and molecular genetic analysis. These cell lines display clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, express surface immunoglobulin and B-cell restricted markers, and exhibit a phenotype consistent with SNCCL. Monoclonal Epstein-Barr virus infection was found in only one of the cell lines (HBL-1). Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated the presence of a chromosomal translocation involving the c-myc proto-oncogene and an immunoglobulin locus in all three cell lines. The pattern of genetic lesions detected in HBL-1, HBL-2, and HBL-3 reflects that found in primary AIDS-SNCCL and includes activation of the c-myc oncogene as well as inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. These cell lines should prove useful in studies of the biological, immunological, and viral factors involved in AIDS-associated lymphomagenesis",

    "Title": "Efficient screening of p53 mutations by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in colorectal tumors",
    "Abstract": "Alterations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene have been found in the vast majority of human tumors. Although some specific codons have been revealed as preferential mutational sites in defined tumor types, mutations are generally so scattered within this region that various screening methods for their detection have been widely used. However, the capacity of these techniques to detect exhaustively all mutations has not been evaluated. In this report, conditions for analysing exons 5-8 of the p53 gene by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) have been elaborated using the Melt87 and SQHTX computer programs. The procedure requires five different amplifications. The screening of 90 colorectal tumors revealed 56 amplification products demonstrating abnormal DGGE behavior. Direct sequencing of these amplification products after asymmetric polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed, besides polymorphism, 49 somatically mutated DNA samples (54.4%) corresponding to 38 different p53 variants. Moreover, 25 additional p53 variants identified in other tumor types were also detectable with our conditions. Thus, altogether the procedure has been successfully used in the detection of 63 different p53 variants. The experimental differences in migration between the wild-type homoduplex DNA molecule and the heteroduplex(es) containing one mismatch were systematically compared with those calculated by the SQHTX program. The computer program was found to be reliably predictive. This DGGE procedure appears thus to be effective and reliable for detecting mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene",

    "Abstract": "Human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and hepatoblastomas (HB) from patients in France and Italy, respectively, which are both areas with a low incidence of HCC and a low dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), were analysed for alterations of the p53 tumour suppressor gene. An abnormality in the p53 gene was detected in only one of the seven HCCs examined. Sequencing of the cDNA of this HCC revealed a G to T transversion at the first nucleotide of codon 245 that was not found in normal tissue, excluding the possibility of germinal transmission of this alteration. All tumours had the wild-type sequence at codon 249, which has been reported to be a mutational hot spot in the p53 gene in HCCs from high incidence areas, such as China and Southern Africa. Seven samples of HB, the most common hepatic tumour of children, were also tested for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and mutations in the p53 gene. In contrast to what is observed in HCC of adulthood, for which environmental conditions are important etiological risk factors, HB probably stems uniquely from genetic disorders. PCR-direct sequencing of exons 4 to 8 and PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCRSSCP) of exons 2, 3 and 9 revealed no mutations in the coding sequences examined. LOH was observed in one of the five informative cases when codon 72 and intron 6 were subjected to polymorphism analysis",

Only 5% of the primary tumour specimens were found to carry an alteration within this gene. However, p53 mutations were 10- fold enriched in ET cell lines, thus indicating a selective growth advantage in vitro. Strikingly, five out of nine alterations detected were missense mutations within codon 273, which were previously reported to impair only partially the normal p53 function. Two single- base substitutions occurred at codons 277 and 176, and two alterations were loss-of-function mutations. Investigation of the MDM2 gene revealed neither gene amplification in the primary tumours and cell lines nor significant overexpression in any of the cell lines. Our data therefore suggest that impairment of cellular mechanisms involving p53 is rare in a distinct group of childhood malignancies",

    "Title": "p53 and K-RAS alterations in pancreatic epithelial cell lesions",
    "Abstract": "We have analysed the expression of p53 at the mRNA level, and extensively at the protein level by immunostaining, Western blotting, and ELISA measurements revealing a p53 increase in 8 out of 14 cell lines established from human pancreatic carcinomas. The mRNA levels closely paralleled the protein levels in most of the cell lines. Overexpression of p53 in tumor cells correlated with mutations in the p53 gene. Immunocytochemistry was also performed with tissue cryosections showing a nuclear p53 staining in 8 out of 12 exocrine, and 2 out of 2 endocrine tumors. In addition, nonmalignant peri-tumoral tissue specimens and cells derived from pancreatic juice of acute pancreatic patients were also positively stained. These findings may suggest functions of p53 in stress situations induced by acute inflammation or tissue regeneration. Genomic mutations in the tumor suppressor gene were associated with point mutations in either codon 12, 13 or 61 in the c-K-RAS oncogene in about two-thirds of cell lines. The frequent activations of a RAS oncogene in combination with mutations of a tumor suppressor gene are likely to contribute to the malignant phenotype of pancreatic adenocarcinomas",

    "Title": "Detailed analysis of genetic alterations in colorectal tumors from patients with and without familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)",
    "Abstract": "To examine early genetic events during colorectal carcinogenesis, we searched for genetic alterations in 75 adenomas from seven patients with familial polyposis coli (FAP) and in 64 sporadic colorectal tumors (63 carcinomas and one adenoma). We investigated germ-line and somatic mutations in the APC gene, somatic mutations in the K-ras and p53 genes, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 8p21-22. Thirty- two FAP adenomas carried detectable somatic mutations in the APC gene. The frequency of somatic APC mutations among adenomas was the same regardless of differences in size or histopathological classification. On the other hand, K-ras mutation was very rare in small adenomas where dysplasia was mild or moderate but frequent in large adenomas with severe dysplasia. Mutation of the p53 gene was observed in only two adenomas and LOH on 8p22 was detected in none. These results imply that a second 'hit' in the APC gene, but not necessarily mutation in K-ras or p53, is an important and critical event for formation of a colorectal adenoma",

    "Title": "Infrequent mutation of p53 gene in hepatitis B virus positive primary hepatocellular carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Somatic mutation of the p53 oncogene/anti-oncogene allele has been shown to be involved in many different human solid tumors. Recently, there have been reports that p53 mutations are found to occur at high frequency (50%) in aflatoxin-related human primary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) (Hsu et al., 1991 Nature, vol 350, p. 427; Bressac et al., 1991 Nature, vol 350, p. 429). Most strikingly, a hotspot G to T mutation at amino acid position 249 was identified. These reports appear to contradict our earlier publications that although p53 mutation is found frequently in human HCC cell lines, it is rarely found in primary tumors. In this paper, we have further examined 20 different primary HCC samples (17 were hepatitis B surface antigen positive) and their adjacent nontumourous tissues, using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. Clear loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found in only 3 out of 20 samples. All three samples were also found to carry a point mutation within the remaining p53 allele. None of these mutations was found to be at the proposed aflatoxin hotspot of amino acid 249. All three point mutations are of somatic origin. Ten samples, randomly chosen from the remaining 17 LOH negative HCC tumors, were analyzed further by DNA sequencing and Western blot analyses. No point mutations of p53 were found. Taken together with our previous report (Hosono et al., 1991, Oncogene vol 6, p. 237-243), we conclude that p53 mutation occurs infrequently, only approximately 18%, in HBV-positive primary hepatomas from Taiwan. Furthermore, p53 mutation appears to be acquired later in tumor development at least in some HCC samples",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations in human epithelial skin cancers",
    "Abstract": "In the present study we analysed 38 epithelial skin cancers, 19 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), 13 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and six Bowen diseases (BwDs), using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) techniques for the presence of p53 and RAS gene mutations. Whereas 48% (9/19) of the BCCs tested presented a mutated p53 gene, the frequency was lower (15%, 2/13) in our series of SCCs and negative in the BwDs. Nine of the 11 characterized mutations were single-nucleotide substitutions and, interestingly, seven of these involved CC dimers, where a C was changed into a T or a G (three C-->T transitions and four C-->G transversions). This mutational pattern, added to the fact that all the mutated tumors occurred at sun-exposed body sites, implicates UV light in their genesis. Furthermore, we observed two internal deletions of 6 and 24 bp whose flanking sequences contained two or three Cs on either strand. In addition to molecular detection, we searched for p53 protein accumulation, by immunocytochemical staining, in a subset of 23 epithelial skin tumors (nine bearing a mutation, 14 which scored negative in our assay). Three commercially available anti-p53 antibodies (PAb CM1, mAbs DO7 and 1801) were used, and 3/23 (all showing a mutated p53 gene) presented specific nuclear staining. In contrast to other reported data we could not detect any activating RAS gene mutation in our series of human skin cancers",

    "Title": "Frequently elevated content of immunochemically defined wild-type p53 protein in colorectal adenomas",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 tumour-suppressor gene are considered to be rare in human colorectal adenomas, a premalignant state of the digestive tract. We have analysed a series of 32 exophytic tumours of the colon and rectum for the presence of p53 protein. In 26 of the 28 pure adenomas, the presence of significant levels of p53 proteins was established by a sensitive two-point enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The detectability of p53 protein was frequently limited to PAb 1801, recognizing an N-terminal epitope. Immunoblotting of the fractions captured by the monoclonal antibodies revealed that PAb 421 reacted exclusively with a 53-kDa species, whereas an additional 48-kDa band was detected after incubation with PAb 1801. In the adenomas, the mutant conformation-specific PAb 240 was always negative and no mutations were detected on exons 5-8 in three large and highly dysplastic lesions, selected for their high p53 protein content. The remaining four of the 32 tumours presented foci of cancer. Three of these were shown to contain 'mutant' PAb 240-reactive p53, and gene mutations were identified in two by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing of the amplified products. Intense p53 nuclear immunohistochemical staining was associated with the malignant areas. We conclude that a novel mechanism affecting the regulation of p53 protein could occur in colorectal adenomas",

    "Title": "p53 oncogene mutations in three human prostate cancer cell lines",
    "Abstract": "p53 gene structure and chromosome 17p alleles were studied in the three human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, DU-145, and PC-3. Our laboratory has two separate culture lines of the LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. One strain, LNCaP-GW, had a mutation in one of two alleles at position 273 (arg > his). This mutation could not be detected in a second strain of LNCaP, LNCaP-ATCC. Immunohistochemical staining for P53 protein in the cell lines indicated that protein overexpression in LNCaP was heterogeneous, even in clonal isolates derived from LNCaP-GW that contained the codon 273 mutation in every cell. We also performed in vitro and in vivo growth analysis to compare the LNCaP-GW and LNCaP-ATCC cells. LNCaP-GW grew more rapidly than LNCaP-ATCC in vitro. However, LNCaP-ATCC formed tumors efficiently when inoculated into nude mice, whereas LNCaP-GW formed tumors much less efficiently. Consideration must be given to the notion that some of these p53 mutations arose during in vitro passage. We also confirmed published findings with two other human prostate cancer cell lines. In DU-145, two mutations were found in the p53 gene. A mutation at codon 274 (pro > leu) and a second mutation at codon 223 (val > phe) were present. PC-3 cells were hemizygous for chromosome 17p. The single copy of the p53 gene had a base pair deletion at codon 138 that generated a frame shift and a new in-frame stop codon at position 169",

    "Abstract": "Abnormalities of the p53 gene and protein were examined in 81 primary breast carcinoma samples. Using a polymerase chain reaction-single- strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis, mutations in p53 exons 5-8 were identified in 13 of 81 tumours (16 per cent) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Positive staining for p53 protein was detected in ten of 77 (13 per cent) of these tumours using polyclonal CM1 antibody on formalin-fixed tissue. Mutations detected by PCR-SSCP analysis were more common in grade III tumours (P = 0.015), but no correlation was found with tumour size, node status or level of epidermal growth factor receptor expression. A p53 mutation was associated with positive antibody staining in only two patients. Positive immunohistochemical staining using a p53 antibody may detect p53 protein expression, but this may not correlate directly with an underlying mutation in the hot spot region examined",

    "Abstract": "We have previously developed conditions to screen for TP53 point mutations inside the conserved domains II-V of the gene by using constant denaturant gel electrophoresis (CDGE). The present study reports conditions for screening more of the codons in the frequently mutated region exon 5-8 and for detecting mutations in sequences encoding functional domains in the N- and C-terminal part of the protein. The ability of the CDGE technique to detect mutations was studied using controls with known sequence deviations. The resolution power of the technique to separate different types of mutations was tested by using seven different single base pair mutants all residing in a stretch of four base pairs. All mutants were separated from the wild type. The established CDGE screening strategy was then used to look for mutations in DNA from 28 osteosarcomas. Six (21.5%) of the samples were shown to have a TP53 mutation, and the exact characterization was performed by direct sequencing. All of these were within the frequently reported mutated region exon 5-8",

Studies of inheritance of p53 germline mutations require confirmation of the mutation in the tumors from family members.

    "Title": "Analyses of p53 gene mutations in primary human bladder cancer",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 have been detected in many tumors. p53 gene mutations are also known to be involved in the progression of human bladder cancers. We investigated structural alterations in the entire coding region of the p53 gene in primary human bladder cancers, using polymerase chain reaction and single- strand conformational polymorphism analysis of RNA. Of 25 samples obtained from patients, 6 (24%) were found to have p53 alterations. DNA sequencing of the PCR products revealed 6 point mutations resulting in single amino-acid substitutions in the regions of exons 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 of this gene, respectively. Five of 6 cases with p53 mutations were invasive, with metastasis or high-grade tumors. Interestingly, the one remaining case was a recurrent, low-grade, and superficial (pTa) tumor. In this early stage tumor, allelic loss of the p53 gene was also found, using a polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Our findings are in agreement with previous observations that p53 mutations occurred in a high percentage of high grade or invasive bladder cancers. Since mutation and allelic loss of the p53 gene were also detected in a low-grade and low-stage tumor in the present study, it is suggested that the p53 gene is involved in early stages of some bladder cancers as well as in their late stages",

    "Title": "The incidence of p53 mutations increases with progression of head and neck cancer",
    "Abstract": "To establish a genetic model of the progression of head and neck squamous carcinoma we have defined the incidence and timing of p53 mutations in this type of cancer. We sequenced the conserved regions of the p53 gene in 102 head and neck squamous carcinoma lesions. These included 65 primary invasive carcinomas and 37 noninvasive archival specimens consisting of 13 severe dysplasias and 24 carcinoma in situ lesions. The incidence of p53 mutations in noninvasive lesions was 19% (7/37) and increased to 43% (28/65) in invasive carcinomas. These data suggest that p53 mutations can precede invasion in primary head and neck cancer. Furthermore, the spectrum of codon hotspots is similar to that seen in squamous carcinoma of the lung and 64% of mutations are at G nucleotides, implicating carcinogens from tobacco smoke in the etiology of head and neck squamous carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "As in most other tumor types, expression of mutated or phenotypically altered p53 is a common occurrence in head and neck carcinogenesis. Since the prognosis for many head and neck tumor patients is severely affected by the occurrence of multiple primary and secondary tumors, we have analyzed the phenotype and genotype of p53 in squamous and respiratory epithelia either adjacent to or at significant distance from the primary tumors. Many tumor patients showed multifocal overexpression of the p53 protein in a variety of these epithelia. Overexpression of p53 correlated with increased proliferation and dedifferentiation, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization using histone H3 and cytokeratin-specific probes. Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing of p53 DNA, amplified from these biopsies after immunostaining and microdissection, confirmed and extended these findings. We have identified different mutations in p53 in different tumor-distant epithelia from the same patients. The data indicate that mutation of p53 is an early event in head and neck carcinogenesis, preceding signs of overt neoplasia, and that different mutations in p53 in multiple foci may provide a molecular basis for the development of multiple tumors",

    "Abstract": "Studies of the role of tumor suppressor genes in human renal cell carcinoma from our laboratory have suggested the presence of a disease gene(s) on the short arm of chromosome 3. Little is known about the role other tumor suppressor genes may play in this malignancy. Abnormalities of chromosome 17p and, in particular of p53, are common in many human malignancies. In order to evaluate the role of this region in renal cell carcinoma, we performed restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of chromosome 17 with probes localized to the p53 region. Fourteen of 29 (48%) evaluable cell lines showed loss of heterozygosity at this locus. Northern blot analysis did not detect a p53 transcript in 4 of 27 cell lines tested. In addition, we screened cell lines for p53 mutations using a polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism technique. Cell lines positive for mutations by this technique were then sequenced. Mutations were detected in 11 of 33 (33%) cell lines, including 8 derived from primary tumors and 3 derived from metastatic foci. Six of 9 (67%) patients with loss of heterozygosity demonstrated a mutation in the remaining allele, while only 1 of 8 (13%) without loss of heterozygosity had a mutation. Three of 3 (100%) cell lines derived from metastases had the same mutation as their matched primary cell line. Loss or mutation of p53 did not correlate either with loss of chromosome 3p or with histological subtype. These results suggest that, while the primary disease gene for kidney cancer appears to be on chromosome 3, abnormalities of p53 are common and may be involved in the progression of this malignancy",

Using DNA extracted from paraffin embedded tissue, polymerase chain reaction amplification, designed restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and DNA sequencing, 1 cystadenoma (5%), 6 LMP tumors (30%), and 1 ovarian carcinoma (4%) demonstrated an activated Ki-ras gene. All of the Ki-ras mutations identified except one were GGT to GAT transversions at codon 12. One LMP tumor demonstrated a CAA to CAC transversion at codon 61. Using polymerase chain reaction/single strand conformational polymorphism, DNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry, 11 ovarian carcinomas (48%) demonstrated a p53 mutation. These mutations included 5 missense, 2 nonsense, and 1 frameshift mutation located within exons 6-8 and 3 mutations that were identified only by immunohistochemical staining. No p53 mutations could be identified in cystadenomas or LMP tumors. Clinically, the presence of either a Ki-ras or p53 mutation was associated with advanced stage disease. The pattern of Ki-ras and p53 mutations appears to distinguish LMP tumors from invasive carcinomas and suggests that they may be separate biological entities",

    "Abstract": "A distinct mutational spectrum for the p53 tumor suppressor gene in bladder carcinomas was established in patients with known exposures to cigarette smoke. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene showed inactivating mutations in 16 of 40 (40%) bladder tumors from smokers and 13 of 40 (33%) tumors from lifetime nonsmokers. Overall, 13 of the 50 (26%) total point mutations discovered in this and previous work were G:C-->C:G transversions, a relatively rare mutational type in human tumors. In six tumors, identical AGA (Arg)-->ACA (Thr) point mutations at codon 280 were observed, suggesting a mutational hotspot in these tumors. Comparison of the mutational spectra from smokers and nonsmokers revealed no obvious differences in the types or positions of inactivating mutations; however, 5 of 15 tumors containing point mutations from cigarette smokers had double mutations, four of which were tandem mutations on the same allele. No double mutations were found in tumors from nonsmoking patients. None of the mutations in smokers were G:C-- >T:A transversions, which would be anticipated for exposure to the suspected cigarette smoke carcinogen 4-aminobiphenyl. The results suggest that, although cigarette smoke exposure may not significantly alter the kinds of mutations sustained in the p53 gene, it may act to increase the extent of DNA damage per mutagenic event",

The p53 tumor suppressor gene is a possible candidate underlying the syndrome because (a) mutations in the p53 gene are ubiquitous in human cancer, including colon carcinoma and gliomas, and (b) somatic or germ line mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene cause the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which is characterized by the association of breast and soft tissue tumors. We determined the DNA sequence of the conserved regions of the p53 gene (exons 5 to 9) in the tumor tissues and lymphocytes of two patients with glioma-polyposis and found that mutations did occur as independent tumor-specific alterations but did not involve the germ line of these patients, suggesting that p53 may play a role in progression but not initiation of the disease",

    "Abstract": "Using the single-strand conformational polymorphism technique, we have screened 66 malignant ovarian tumors for p53 mutation in exons 5 to 8. Thirty-four of the tumors demonstrated a single-strand conformational polymorphism band shift in this region of the gene, including 6 in exon 5, 7 in exon 6, 12 in exon 7, and 10 in exon 8 (one of the tumors showed a shift for exons 7 and 8). All of the single-strand conformational polymorphism shifts have been further characterized by DNA sequencing, and 31 of 35 have been shown to represent genuine DNA alterations. These include 27 point mutations (23 missense, 2 nonsense, and 2 silent mutations), 3 deletions (a 2-base pair deletion introducing, by frameshift, a stop codon further downstream; a 3-base pair deletion; and an unusual 6-base pair deletion made up of separate 2-base pair and 4-base pair deletions), and a 4-base pair insertion (introducing a stop codon downstream). In total, 29 of the 66 (44%) carcinomas analyzed had mutations affecting the primary sequence of the p53 protein. p53 mutation was found in tumors of all International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians stages, suggesting that it might be an earlier genetic event in the progression of epithelial ovarian tumors than previously thought. A significantly greater number of p53 mutations were seen in high-grade serous carcinomas than in those of endometrioid and mucinous types (0.02 > P > 0.01). Analysis of the distribution of point mutations showed no preference for any particular mutation type",

    "Title": "Discordant p53 gene mutations in primary head and neck cancers and corresponding second primary cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract",
    "Abstract": "Patients with primary head and neck malignancies have a 3-7% yearly incidence of second primary cancers. It is thought that these second primary cancers arise independently following exposure to a common carcinogen by a process that has been called field cancerization. Since mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene represent a genetic alteration occurring during the evolution of premalignant lesions to malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract, we analyzed mutations in the p53 gene of patients with cancer of the head and neck who developed second primary tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract epithelium to test the field cancerization hypothesis. DNA was extracted from primary head and neck cancers and second primary cancers of 31 patients. DNA from exons 5-8 of the p53 gene was analyzed by the single strand conformation polymorphism technique to identify the locations of the mutations in different regions of the gene. DNA from 6 patients was also sequenced by the chain termination method to confirm the presence of mutations and determine the base substitutions. Twenty-one of the 31 patients had 1 or more p53 mutations. In all 21 cases the genetic lesions were discordant such that the presence or location of the mutations in the initial primary cancer differed from those of the second and third primary cancers. In each of the five patients with mutations in both primary tumors, the mutations occurred in different regions of the p53 gene. Of the other 16 patients, 8 had a p53 mutation in the first primary but not the subsequent primary cancer and the other 8 had no mutation in the initial primary but did have a mutation in subsequent primary cancers. Sequencing confirmed the single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and showed that 73% of the mutations were transitions. The discordant p53 mutations in second primary cancers arising in patients with primary epithelial cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract suggest that these cancers arise as independent events. These observations provide the first demonstration of a molecular basis for field cancerization effects in cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract",

    "Title": "Mutations of the p53 gene are involved in Ewing's sarcomas but not in neuroblastomas",
    "Abstract": "We have investigated the frequency of p53 gene mutations in Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and neuroblastoma (NB) by using polymerase chain reaction- single strand conformation polymorphism analysis for genomic DNA or complementary DNA generated from total RNA. Mutations of the p53 gene were found in six of seven ES cell lines: a missense mutation of TGC (Cys)-->TAC (Try) at codon 141 in one, a missense mutation of CGT (Arg)- ->TGT (Cys) at codon 273 in one, a missense mutation of TGC (Cys)-->TTC (Phe) at codon 176 in three, and one base deletion of CGC-->CG at codon 283 in one. Further analysis of 14 ES and related primary tumors showed mutations of the p53 gene in only two: one base insertion of CCG-->CCCG at codon 152 in one and a missense mutation of GGC (Gly)-->GTC (Val) at codon 154 in the other. Both of the two tumors were obtained from patients with an advanced stage disease. Three of the eight ESs with mutations of the p53 gene showed the same missense mutation at codon 176, suggesting the mutational hot spot of the p53 gene in ESs. In contrast to ES, none of 6 NB cell lines or 48 NB tumors including advanced-stage ones with or without N-myc amplification showed any aberration of the p53 gene. Our findings suggest that mutations of the p53 gene in ES might represent late genetic events related to tumor progression, and that aberrations of the p53 gene might not be involved in the development or the progression of NB",

    "Title": "Role and mutational heterogeneity of the p53 gene in hepatocellular carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "The mutational spectrum of the p53 gene was analyzed in 53 hepatocellular carcinomas. Somatic mutations of the p53 gene were detected in 17 cases (32%). Among these 17 mutations, 9 were missense mutations; the mutations in the other 8 cases were nonsense mutations, deletions, or mutations at the intron-exon junctions. These mutations were found in a wide region stretching from exon 4 to exon 10 without any single mutational hot spot. G:C to T:A transversions were predominant, suggesting the involvement of environmental mutagens in the mutagenesis of the p53 gene in a subset of the hepatocellular carcinoma cases. Mutations of the p53 gene occurred frequently in advanced tumors, although several tumors in the early stages also showed mutations. A deletion map of chromosome 17 was constructed by using 10 polymorphic probes and was compared with the p53 gene mutation in each case. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 17p was observed in 49% of the cases (24 of 49), and two commonly deleted regions were detected (around the p53 locus and at 17p13.3 to the telomere). Sixteen of the 17 cases with p53 gene mutations showed LOH around the p53 locus, and mutations were rare in hepatocellular carcinomas without LOH. However, no mutations were detected in 8 cases with LOH on 17p, suggesting the possibility that an unidentified tumor suppressor gene(s) located on 17p may have also been involved in hepatocarcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Base transitions are the most frequent genetic changes at P53 in gastric cancer",
    "Abstract": "We searched for P53 mutations in gastric carcinoma by analyzing tumor DNAs from 29 patients. We detected 13 different somatic mutations in 15 patients (52%) and a biallelic polymorphism in exon 6 (5 heterozygous subjects). The somatic mutations were mainly localized in the sequences corresponding to the highly conserved domains of the protein. Twelve samples showed a single base change: 11 missense and 1 nonsense mutations. Three samples showed deletions leading to a frame shift, to the in-frame loss of 2 amino acids, and to the deletion of a splicing site. All point mutations, except one, were transitions, and 91% of them were G:C-->A:T changes. We previously analyzed this panel of tumors for allelic loss at the 17p13 chromosomal region, where the P53 gene had previously been located: the results showed an increasing incidence of allelic loss in late-stage tumors. On the contrary, in the present study no trend between P53 mutations and tumor stages was found. This observation indicates that mutation events precede allelic loss in gastric cancer. Half (54%) of the mutations occurred in samples without allelic loss, suggesting that specific mutated alleles, acting in a dominant negative fashion, can alter in vivo the P53 protein function",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 gene are among the most common genetic changes in human carcinomas. They have been found in many tumor types including colon, lung, and breast. We have used constant denaturant gel electrophoresis in order to screen samples from 109 breast carcinomas for mutations in four conserved regions, exons 5, 7, and 8, of the p53 gene. Samples were also analyzed for allelic loss of the p53 gene and of markers more distal on chromosome 17 p. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutations were found in 18 of the 109 samples (16.5%). Loss of heterozygosity at 17p was detected in the majority of informative mutated cases. All cases were also screened for germ line mutations, but none were found. The results obtained were analyzed with respect to clinical parameters and prognosis. There was a significant association between p53 mutation and low content of estrogen receptor protein in the tumors (P = 0.01). An association with poor prognosis was strongly indicated by mortality rates that were 37.5% among the patients with p53 mutation and 9.4% for the control group (mean follow up, 32 months). P53 mutation was found to be the strongest negative factor against survival in a covariate survival analysis (P = 0.001)",

    "Abstract": "Point mutations in exons of the tumor suppressor p53 gene occur frequently in many human tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma and are extensively studied. However, intronic point mutations are rare and are totally unknown for hepatocellular carcinoma. By reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification of p53 RNA from hepatocellular carcinoma tissues of 45 Taiwanese patients, we found amplified complementary DNA fragments of abnormal size in 4 (9%) tumor samples. Sequence analysis of these complementary DNA products revealed aberrant retention of intron 7 in one sample, insertion of 49 base pairs of the 3' end of intron 6 in 2 samples, and deletion of exon 4 in the other sample. Direct sequencing of their genomic DNA revealed relevant point mutations at consensus sequence at either the 5' or 3' splice site of intron 7, 6, 6, and 3, respectively. The splicing mutations produced p53 mutants with truncation of COOH-terminus that are identical to those found in lung cancers. Three of the 4 patients with splicing mutations were younger and had huge tumors. The results suggest a possible role of these p53 mutants in the development of human cancers",

    "Title": "Altered messenger RNA and unique mutational profiles of p53 and Rb in human esophageal carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Seventy-nine esophageal carcinoma patients were studied for genetic abnormalities in the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor genes. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing were used to detect p53 point mutations, Northern blotting was used to examine abnormal expression of p53 and Rb, and polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting were used to analyze allelic loss. Twenty-five cases were analyzed by DNA sequencing to detect mutations in p53. Fourteen samples contained mutations within exons 5 through 9 of p53; seven had missense mutations giving rise to single amino acid substitutions. The remaining seven (50%) contained nonsense mutations leading to premature termination, five due to single base pair substitutions, and two that were the result of frameshift mutations. In other human tumors, p53 mutations are predominantly missense mutations, but our data as well as those from other groups show that nonsense mutations are common in human esophageal cancer. All but one of the constitutionally heterozygous samples containing mutations also manifested loss of the normal p53 allele; the one exception without allelic loss contained a silent mutation, which should not have had any affect on the p53 protein product. In addition, Northern blotting analysis revealed abnormalities (altered transcript size or mRNA levels) in 5 of 7 cases involving p53 and in 2 of 7 cases analyzed for Rb. Thirty-four cases were informative for allelic loss studies of both p53 and Rb; of these, 25 (74%) lost heterozygosity of p53, Rb, or both. When point mutations and mRNA expression abnormalities were also considered, 33 of 45 (73%) tumors informative for allelic loss assays of both genes as well as for mRNA or point mutation studies showed one or more abnormalities in p53 or Rb. Our results strongly suggest that a unique profile of molecular alterations involving p53 and Rb characterizes human esophageal cancer and that these specific genetic lesions are important in the development and/or progression of most human esophageal carcinomas",

    "Title": "p53 is mutated in a subset of advanced-stage prostate cancers",
    "Abstract": "Inactivation of p53, a tumor suppressor gene, contributes to the genesis and/or progression of a substantial fraction of all human cancers, including > or = 50% of breast, lung, and colon carcinomas. Mutated p53 alleles typically contain missense single-base substitutions within exons 5-8 and encode abnormally stable p53 proteins that accumulate to high levels in tumor cell nuclei. To evaluate the frequency, type, and clinical significance of p53 mutation in human prostate cancer, archival tumor material from 150 prostate cancer patients was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with anti- p53 antibodies. Abnormal nuclear p53 accumulation (IHC) was observed in 19 tumors (12.7%) and was strongly related to disease stage (23% of 69 stage III or IV tumors were IHC+ versus 4% of 74 stage 0-II tumors; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). The methods of polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformational polymorphism, and direct sequencing were used to identify mutations, predominantly missense single-base substitutions in exons 5, 7, or 8 in 9 of 14 IHC+ cases but in none of 20 IHC- cases; 5 of these mutations were G:C-->A:T transitions at CpG dinucleotides. These data indicate that mutated p53 alleles are quite uncommon in early prostate cancers but are found in 20-25% of advanced cancers, suggesting a role for p53 mutation in the progression of at least a subset of prostate cancers",

Alterations of p53, consisting of point mutations, deletions, or overexpression, were detected in one-third (8 of 24) of the sarcomas. MDM2 gene amplification was detected in another 8 tumors, but no tumor contained an alteration of both genes. Monoclonal antibodies reactive with the human MDM2 gene product were developed, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed nuclear localization and overexpression of MDM2 in those tumors with amplified MDM2 genes. These data support the hypothesis that p53 and MDM2 genetic alterations are alternative mechanisms for inactivating the same regulatory pathway for suppressing cell growth",

Mutations were detected in 15 of 32 (47%) tumor samples, in which G:C to T:A transversions were rather frequent (33%). Previously, we reported deletion of chromosome 17p where the p53 gene is located in 45% of Japanese esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and here the relationship between mutation of the p53 gene and loss of 17p was analyzed. Mutations were observed in 12 of 16 patients with loss of 17p, whereas only 2 of 11 without loss were positive for mutations, suggesting that mutations of the p53 gene were closely associated with a 17p deletion. Furthermore, we immunohistochemically analyzed the expression of p53 protein in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tumor tissues using a monoclonal antibody. Five of 6 tumors with missense mutations of the p53 gene were positively stained, while in tumors with nonsense mutations or without mutations of the p53 gene staining was very weak or negative. These results suggest a good correlation between mutations and abnormal expression of the p53 gene",

Enomoto et al., Cancer Res., 51: 5308-5314, 1991) a significant frequency of activating point mutations in codon 12 of the c-K-ras-2 protooncogene in endometrial adenocarcinoma and its premalignant precursor lesions (series 1 and 2). To reveal the role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in the development of endometrial adenocarcinoma and to study the association of p53 alterations with K- ras activation, an additional 28 endometrial adenocarcinomas and an additional 11 premalignant atypical uterine hyperplasias (series 3), as well as 12 cases of endometrial adenocarcinoma (10 having K- or N-ras activation) and 2 cases of atypical hyperplasia from series 1 and 2, were screened for the presence of p53 alterations. Allelic loss, recognized at the polymorphic site in codon 72 of the p53 gene, was detected in 6 of 19 (32%) informative cases of endometrial adenocarcinoma and 1 of 4 (25%) informative cases of endometrial atypical hyperplasia by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA fragments. Mutations in the highly conserved regions of the p53 gene were detected by single- strand conformation polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified DNA fragments. Mutations were found in 9 of 40 (23%) endometrial adenocarcinomas and 1 of 13 (8%) atypical hyperplasias that were studied. Mutations in p53 were significantly more frequently found in clinical grade 3 (G3) cancers (6 of 14, 43%) than in G1-G2 cancers (3 of 26, 12%) (P = 0.033). Mutations were subsequently confirmed by direct sequencing. Single missense base substitutions were detected in 6 cases of endometrial carcinoma and in one case of atypical hyperplasia. Deletions of a single base and of 2 bases were each detected in single cases of endometrial carcinoma, and a single base insertion was found in a third case. Point mutations in K-ras were also identified in tumors of series 3 by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA fragments of exons 1 and 2. Point mutations in codons 12 and 13 in K-ras were detected by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA in 7 of 28 adenocarcinomas in series 3, but none were found in exon 2 (codons 59.63. The spectrum of point mutations in p53 in endometrial adenocarcinomas was almost identical to what we found in K-ras in series 1 and 2 and in series 3, suggesting the possible role of a mutagen that might be responsible for mutations in both K-ras and p53.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "Abstract": "The mutation patterns of the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been shown to reflect the specific carcinogen(s) involved, or the epidemiological background in some cancers. To elucidate the impact of cigarette smoking or bilharzial infection on the p53 gene mutation pattern, 61 cases of urothelial cancer from Japan and 7 cases of bladder cancer with schistosomiasis from Egypt were examined for mutations of the p53 gene. In total, p53 gene mutations were detected in 20 Japanese cases (33%) and 6 Egyptian cases (86%). Although the incidence of p53 gene mutation was not significantly influenced by habitual smoking, a different mutation pattern was observed as follows: 4 of 10 mutations in smokers in Japan were A:T to G:C transitions, whereas such mutations were not detected in any of 10 mutations in nonsmokers, or in any of 6 mutations associated with schistosomiasis. Although no specific mutation pattern was detected for the squamous cell carcinomas with schistosomiasis, all 8 base substitutions observed in tumors with squamous cell carcinomas occurred at G:C sites, whereas base substitutions at A:T sites were observed in 33% (6 of 18) of mutations in transitional cell carcinomas. Our results suggest that cigarette smoking may have a significant impact on the mutations of the p53 gene in urothelial cancers. Furthermore, the distinct spectrum of the p53 gene mutation found in tumors with squamous cell carcinomas may reflect their unique etiological backgrounds",

    "Title": "Mutation of the p53 gene in neuroblastoma and its relationship with N- myc amplification",
    "Abstract": "Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene frequently occurs in a variety of tumors including lung, breast, gastrointestinal, and brain, as well as lymphomas-leukemias. Neuroblastoma, one of the most common solid tumors in childhood, often has amplification of the N-myc gene. We examined for mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene by single- strand conformational polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction products and direct sequencing method in neuroblastoma; in addition, we assessed the relationship between p53 mutation and N-myc gene amplification in the disease. Of 86 DNA samples from patients with neuroblastoma, two mutations (2%) were found in the coding region of the p53 gene. Each mutation caused a substitution of amino acid residues. One mutation was located in exon 5, and another was in exon 6. N-myc gene was amplified in 26% of the samples. No p53 mutations were found in neuroblastoma samples with N-myc amplification. In the two individuals, p53 mutations appeared as their disease became more progressive. The neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) gene is frequently abnormal in another neural disorder, neurofibromatosis type 1; in addition, a potential mutational hot spot of NF1 at lysine at codon 1423 has been identified in several types of tumors. Using single-strand conformational polymorphism, we were unable to detect an abnormality in this region of NF1 in 50 samples of neuroblastoma. The data suggest that p53 mutations occasionally are associated with progression of neuroblastomas, and tumorigenetic influences of mutant p53 may differ from those of N-myc",

    "Title": "p53 abnormalities in different subtypes of human sarcomas",
    "Abstract": "In this report we examined p53 alterations at the DNA, mRNA, and protein levels on tissue from 39 patients with different subtypes of sarcoma. Loss of heterozygosity for the chromosome 17p region was found in 60, 63, and 33% of 10 informative osteosarcomas, 11 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, and 6 leiomyosarcomas, respectively. In addition, 2 of 10 tumors belonging to a heterogeneous group of soft tissue sarcomas showed loss of heterozygosity. Elevated levels of p53 mRNA were found in six tumors, four had a truncated transcript, and in six patients no mRNA was detected. In most cases, elevated transcript levels were accompanied by overexpression of protein as studied by immunohistochemistry, whereas the presence of truncated transcripts was associated with negative immunostaining. Point mutations in exons 5, 7, or 8 of the TP53 gene were detected in seven tumors. Six of these expressed high levels of mRNA and protein, probably reflecting a point mutation in one of the alleles and loss of the other. Three of the mutations have not previously been described. Taken together, p53 abnormalities were found in approximately 65% of the osteosarcomas, malignant fibrous histiocytomas, and leiomyosarcomas examined and in 30% of the other soft tissue tumors. The results indicate that the TP53 gene is involved in the tumorigenesis of several sarcoma subtypes in a higher fraction of cases than was previously recognized",

    "Title": "Tumor progression in hepatocellular carcinoma may be mediated by p53 mutation",
    "Abstract": "Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often contains intratumoral subpopulations of heterogeneous cellular differentiations within each tumor. To analyze the genetic alterations of p53 in the heterogeneous subpopulations, we examined 68 intratumoral nodular lesions within 34 HCCs composed of two distinct subpopulations. The cellular differentiations were determined histologically by Edmondson's grading system. Nine (26.5%) of 34 HCCs examined were found to have genetic alterations in exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene, resulting in amino acid substitutions. Three of these nine HCCs with p53 mutations showed genetic heterogeneity of the p53 gene within each tumor; one HCC had a single missense mutation at codon 210 (asparginine to 210-serine) in an intratumoral lesion of Edmondson Grade II and double missense mutations at codons 210 and 217 (asparginine to 210-serine and valine to 217- alanine) in another intratumoral lesion of Edmondson Grade III. The remaining two HCCs had p53 mutations only in lesions of a higher grade. In total, the p53 mutations were detected in none of eight Edmondson Grade I lesions, in five of 29 Grade III lesions (17.2%), in eight of 26 Grade III lesions (30.8%), and in three of five Grade IV lesions (60.0%). Thus, our data revealed that the p53 mutations were closely related to the progression of HCC and that, in certain cases, malignant cells which acquired the p53 mutations might develop into dedifferentiated subpopulations within individual HCC",

    "Title": "TP53 gene mutation profile in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is a form of cancer occurring most commonly in males, particularly those living in some areas of Asia, Africa, and western Europe. In some of these tumors, a sequence alteration has been identified in the coding region of the TP53 gene which is known to inactivate the tumor suppressor function of its product. Using a GC clamp (i.e., a GC rich domain) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis assay we have been able to identify sequence modifications in 27 of the 32 tumor samples analyzed (84%). Most of the mutations occur in exon 6, a region of the gene which has not previously been reported as being a hot spot for the mutations of other cancers. Twelve of the mutations reported here have not been described in other types of tumors and these consist mostly of frameshift or splice mutations. The distribution of mutations [transitions (45%), transversions (34%), and frameshift (21%)] suggests that the etiological contribution of genotoxic factors might be complex and might associate different exogenous and endogenous mutagen exposures",

    "Title": "Infrequent mutations of the p53 gene in pulmonary carcinoid tumors",
    "Abstract": "Archival specimens of 25 pulmonary carcinoids including 15 cases of typical carcinoid, 9 atypical carcinoids, and 1 large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma were analyzed for mutations in exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene. Mutations were identified in 4 tumors, including 3 out of 15 (20%) typical carcinoids and the single large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, but none of the atypical carcinomas showed a mutation. The mutations were acquired during tumor development since they were not present in the corresponding nontumorous tissue. All mutations in the typical carcinoids, a tumor type without epidemiological link to cigarette smoking, were G to A transitions. The level of p53 protein was investigated by immunohistochemistry with the polyclonal antibody CM-1. None of the pulmonary carcinoids investigated showed a positive reaction, despite the presence of missense mutations in two cases. Negative staining of carcinoids with mutations was also observed with the monoclonal antibodies pAb1801 and DO-1. Our data suggest that point mutations of the p53 gene are infrequent in pulmonary carcinoids thus contrasting the findings in other histological types of lung cancer, in particular small-cell lung cancer. Moreover, negative immunostaining for p53 is no indicator for the absence of p53 missense mutations in typical carcinoids",

    "Title": "p53 mutation does not correlate with radiosensitivity in 24 head and neck cancer cell lines",
    "Abstract": "The molecular basis of tumor response to therapeutic radiation is poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests the p53 tumor suppressor gene may be involved in production of the G1 arrest seen following DNA damage by X-irradiation. It has further been proposed that tumor cells lacking the p53 checkpoint function are likely to be more sensitive to cell killing by X-irradiation because these cells enter S phase despite unrepaired DNA damage. We tested the hypothesis that tumor cells with p53 mutations are more radiosensitive by correlating the in vitro surviving fraction at 2 Gy with the mutational status of 24 head and neck squamous cell cancer cell lines. p53 mutations were present in 15 of 24 (63%) of tumors; all were homozygous changes occurring within exons 5-9. The surviving fraction at 2 Gy for the group with mutations was 0.568 compared to 0.507 for tumors without mutations (P = 0.28, Mann-Whitney test). Furthermore, no association between radiosensitivity and mutational type, codon location, or predicted amino acid alteration was noted. Our data do not support the hypothesis that p53 gene alteration predisposes tumor cells to increased cell killing via radiation",

    "Title": "Role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in cell cycle arrest and radiosensitivity of Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "We have assessed the role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in cell cycle arrest and cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation in 17 Burkitt's lymphoma and lymphoblastoid cell lines. Cell cycle arrest was assessed by flow cytometry of cells 16 h following irradiation. In addition to the usual G2 arrest, the cell lines exhibited three types of responses in G1: Class I, strong arrest in G1 following radiation; Class II, minimal arrest; and Class III, an intermediate response. All Class I cells contained normal p53 genes. Of the ten lines that showed minimal G1 arrest, eight had mutant p53 alleles, and two lines were heterozygous for p53 mutations. Both of the lines showing an intermediate response contained wild-type p53. Our results are consistent with the view that mutations abrogate the ability of p53 to induce G1 arrest following radiation. Studies with the heterozygotes showed that the mutant protein can have a dominant negative influence upon wild-type p53, and the reduced ability of two normal p53 lines to arrest in G1 indicated that p53 function can be impaired by other mechanisms. The radiosensitivity of most of the lines appeared to depend on the ability of p53 to induce a G1 arrest. The mean radiation dose that inhibited proliferation of the Class I lines by 50% was 0.98 Gy. Of the eight p53 mutant cell lines tested, five lines required approximately 2.9 Gy to cause a 50% inhibition of cell proliferation. The two heterozygotes were also more resistant to radiation than the Class I cells (50% inhibitory dose, 2.1 and 2.9 Gy). Our results suggest that radioresistance is afforded by a loss of function of wild-type p53, which would normally induce a G1 arrest and promote cell death in the presence of DNA damage",

    "Abstract": "The p53 gene was examined in a series of formalin-fixed paraffin- embedded astrocytic neoplasms of various types by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP), and direct sequencing of amplified DNA. PCR primers were designed to amplify three DNA fragments encompassing exons 5, 7, and 8 with splice sites, including all four mutational 'hot spots' within this gene. SSCP was performed in a polyacrylamide gel containing 10% glycerol. Two mutations were found among the 20 high and intermediate grade adult astrocytomas studied by this sensitive screening technique and confirmed by sequencing of the PCR product. (1) An anaplastic astrocytoma disclosed a T-A transversion in Codon 246 giving rise to a methionine to lysine amino acid substitution. (2) A giant cell glioblastoma disclosed a G to A transition in Codon 285 resulting in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution. Both mutations were associated with loss of the normal allele. Twenty-three DNA fragments that disclosed no mutation by SSCP analysis were confirmed to be negative by direct sequencing of amplified DNA. No mutations were detected in a series of eight juvenile cerebellar astrocytomas, a biologically distinct form of low-grade astrocytoma. Mutations of the p53 gene may play an important pathogenetic role in a subset of human astrocytomas",

Mutations were detected in 14 cases. The transitions were six G to A and two A to G; the transversions were one C to G and two A to C; the remaining three were frameshift mutations. Immunostaining results were identical with both antibodies. Nuclear immunohistochemical p53-positive cells were found in nine p53 mutated cases and in 12 cases in which no mutation was detected. In most of these latter cases only a minority of cancer cells showed immunohistochemical positivity. Twenty-nine cases, including all p53 mutated cancers, were known to contain codon 12 Ki-ras gene mutations. Also in the light of the demonstrated cooperation of ras and p53 gene alterations in the transformation of cultured cells, our data suggest that p53 mutation is one of the genetic defects that may have a role in the pathogenesis of a proportion of pancreatic cancers",

    "Title": "High levels of p53 protein expression do not correlate with p53 gene mutations in anaplastic large cell lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "Strong immunohistochemical reactivity for p53 tumor suppressor gene product has been reported in a variety of different human malignancies including CD30- (Ki-1) positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Although high levels of p53 protein have been interpreted as abnormal, rapidly proliferating benign and neoplastic lymphoid cells may have increased p53 expression in the absence of structural alterations. On the other hand, mutations in the p53 gene can lead to a lack of p53 protein production. Structural alterations of the p53 gene have not been documented in cases of ALCL and the mechanism for an abnormal pattern of p53 expression in these lymphomas has not been elucidated. Therefore, to determine whether an altered pattern of p53 expression correlates with mutations in the p53 locus in ALCL, we analyzed the expression of p53 protein immunohistochemically, compared it with the proliferation index using monoclonal antibody Ki-67, and assessed the presence of mutations in exons 5 though 9 of the p53 gene using a single-strand conformation polymorphism assay in a panel of 17 ALCLs. Furthermore, we studied the presence of allelic deletions of chromosome 17p by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. We found significant levels of p53 protein expression in 12 of the 15 cases studied, but identified mutations in only one of 17 cases. An allelic deletion in chromosome 17p was identified only in the one case containing a mutated p53 gene. Whereas the case containing structural alterations in the p53 gene did have strong p53 immunoreactivity, 11 cases that lacked p53 mutations in the regions examined also had significant levels of p53. Thus, our studies indicate that strong immunohistochemical reactivity for p53 is not a reliable indicator of the presence of structural alterations of p53 gene exons 5 through 9 in ALCL.",

    "Abstract": "The spectrum of p53 gene mutations was determined in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of small-cell lung cancer derived from 28 patients. By direct sequencing of exons 5, 7, and 8, including their flanking intron sequences, 18 mutations were identified in 17 tumors (61%), and in all but two of these the wild type allele was lost. In 8 cases, the mutation detected in the tumor was absent from the corresponding normal tissue, indicating that these mutations were somatically acquired. In two patients, identical mutations were found in the primary tumor and corresponding metastases. In a further case, an intrapulmonary metastasis did not show the mutation detected in the primary tumor. The local distribution of the mutations resembled that reported in non-small cell lung cancer and gave no indication of distinct bot spot regions. G-to-T transversions were the predominant type of mutation, reflecting a possible genotoxic influence of carcinogens contained in tobacco smoke. Mutations were equally distributed among tumors with intermediate and oat cell histology and did not show a significant association to age and gender of the patients. Also, no significant relationship was observed between the presence of a mutation and tumor stage (T, N, M) or survival. However, transitions at CpG dinucleotides were restricted to tumors without detectable metastases at the time of biopsy, whereas all other mutations occurred in metastasizing small cell lung cancer",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations and MDM2 amplification are uncommon in primary carcinomas of the uterine cervix",
    "Abstract": "The p53 gene is the most frequently altered gene known thus far in a wide variety of human cancers. Inactivation of p53, either through mutation or through interaction with the human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncoprotein, is a characteristic feature of all cervical carcinoma cell lines that have been studied. These findings suggest that p53 inactivation is required for cervical carcinoma development and that HPV infection and p53 mutation may be mutually exclusive. We have studied the p53 gene in 35 primary cervical carcinomas. DNA sequence and single strand conformational polymorphism analyses were used to evaluate p53 in 27 squamous carcinomas (25 HPV-positive) and eight adenocarcinomas (four HPV-positive). A missense mutation of p53 was observed in one HPV 16-positive squamous carcinoma, demonstrating that p53 mutations can occur in combination with HPV infection. The HPV- negative tumors all lacked p53 gene mutations. The absence of p53 mutations in HPV-negative cases prompted an assessment of tumors for MDM2 gene amplification. The MDM2 gene encodes a p53 binding protein and has been found to be amplified in some human tumors lacking p53 mutations. MDM2 amplification was not identified in any of the tumors we examined, including four HPV-negative cases. Our findings show that HPV infection and p53 gene mutation are not mutually exclusive and suggest that many HPV-negative carcinomas may arise via a pathway independent of p53 inactivation",

    "Title": "p53 alterations in human squamous cell carcinomas and carcinoma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "p53 alterations were studied in a group of 22 primary squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the head and neck and in 10 cell lines derived from SCC. Positive immunohistochemical detection of p53 was accomplished in 10 of 22 primary tumors and in 7 of 10 SCC cell lines. Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 17p, were the p53 gene is localized, was seen in five of seven SCC lines studied. DNA sequencing of the p53 gene of these five cell lines that had lost one allele showed p53 mutations in the remaining allele. In addition, from six primary SCC that exhibited loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 17p, three showed missense mutations of the p53 gene. The mutations of primary tumors and SCC cell lines were scattered in the midregion of the gene, affecting codons 151, 155, 174, 194, 220, 248, and 273. Five of these mutations modified guanine residues, a phenomenon that has been associated with the effect of carcinogens contained in tobacco smoke. Collectively these data show that approximately 50% of primary tumors and cell lines derived from SCC of the head and neck showed abnormalities of the p53 gene. In addition, it is of interest to note that the most invasive cell lines, as determined in an in vivo assay using xenotransplantation of tumor cells into denuded rat tracheal grafts, exhibited the most intense staining. Similarly, of five very advanced primary tumors, four showed intense p53 immunostain. These observations support the evidence that alterations in this tumor suppressor gene could be related to late events in tumor progression",

    "Abstract": "Eleven tumors of the ampulla of Vater (5 stage IV and 2 stage II adenocarcinomas, 1 stage II papillary carcinoma, 1 neuroendocrine carcinoma, and 2 adenomas, one with foci of carcinoma) were examined for Ki-ras and p53 gene mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments. Ki-ras mutations were found in one adenocarcinoma and in the adenoma with foci of carcinoma, both involving mainly the intraduodenal bile duct component of the ampulla. Seven cases showed p53 gene mutations: four advanced-stage adenocarcinomas, the papillary carcinoma, the neuroendocrine carcinoma, and the adenoma with foci of carcinoma. Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein was immunohistochemically detected in the morphologically high- grade areas of the five cancers harboring a p53 gene missense point mutation. The adenomas, the two frame shift-mutated cancers, and the adenomatous and low-grade cancer areas of mutated carcinomas were immunohistochemically negative. Our data suggest that in ampullary neoplasia 1) p53 mutations are common abnormalities associated with the transformation of adenomas and low-grade cancers into morphologically high-grade carcinomas, and 2) Ki-ras mutations are relatively less frequent and might be restricted to tumors originating from the bile duct component of the ampulla",

    "Abstract": "Using immunocytochemical and Western blotting techniques we have demonstrated the presence of abnormally high levels of p53 protein in 8/24 (33%) of human squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 9/18 (50%) of SCC cell lines. There was a correlation between the immunocytochemical results obtained with eight SCC samples and their corresponding cell lines. Direct sequencing of PCR-amplified, reverse transcribed, p53 mRNA confirmed the expression of point mutations in six of the positive cell lines and detected in-frame deletions in two others. We also detected two stop mutations and three out-of-frame deletions in five lines which did not express elevated levels of p53 protein. Several of the mutations found in SCC of the tongue (3/7) were in a region (codons 144-166) previously identified as being a p53 mutational hot spot in non-small cell lung tumours (Mitsudomi et al., 1992). In 11/13 cases only the mutant alleles were expressed suggesting loss or reduced expression of the wild type alleles in these cases. Six of the mutations were also detected in the SCCs from which the lines were derived, strongly suggesting that the mutations occurred, and were selected, in vivo. The 12th mutation GTG-->GGG (valine-->glycine) at codon 216 was expressed in line SCC-12 clone B along with an apparently normal p53 allele and is to our knowledge a novel mutation. Line BICR- 19 also expressed a normal p53 allele in addition to one where exon 10 was deleted. Additionally 15 of the SCC lines (including all of those which did not show elevated p53 protein levels) were screened for the presence of human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 and were found to be negative. These results are discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of SCC and the immortalisation of human keratinocytes in vitro",

As Senegal is a country where liver cancer incidence is one of the highest in the world and where people are highly exposed to aflatoxin, we screened 15 liver cancer samples from this country for mutation at codon 249 of the p53 gene. Non-tumoral DNA from the patients showed a wild type genotype. Mutation at codon 249 of the p53 gene was detected in 10 of the 15 tumour tissues tested (67%). This frequency of mutation in codon 249 of the p53 gene is the highest described. These results confirmed that there is an association between countries of high aflatoxin intake and a high frequency of mutation in codon 249 of p53 gene, and that HBV alone does not contribute to these base changes",

    "Abstract": "The expression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in ten human cell lines (nine cancers and one normal) was studied using reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. Using P53U and P53D primers for amplifying a 371-base pair (bp) target fragment spanning exons 7-10 of p53 cDNA, normal-sized PCR products were amplified from 9 cell lines but not from the Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line. An additional larger band (504 bp) was observed for the Molt-4 T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. Employing P531 and P53D primers which flank a 76-bp p53 cDNA fragment, 76 bp as well as 209 bp products were generated by PCR of Molt-4 cDNA. Direct sequencing of the 504 bp and 209 bp bands confirmed the presence of a 133 bp insertion between exons 9 and 10 in the aberrant transcript. This insertion was homologous to a 130-bp sequence within the wild-type p53 intron 9, except for 2 point mutations and 3 base insertions. Sequencing of P53U/P53D PCR products of Molt-4 genomic DNA revealed an 8 bp deletion just downstream to the 133 bp insertion, creating a novel donor splicing site within intron 9. This site, coupled with an inherent acceptor splicing site just upstream to the 133 bp insertion, suggests that the 133 bp stretch represents an alternative exon. The occurrence of a termination signal within this alternative transcript is predicted to culminate in a truncated p53 translational product. The sequences of the 371 bp PCR products of Molt-4, HT-1080, SiHa, CaSki, HeLa and MRC-5 cell lines corresponded with the wild-type p53 cDNA. G-->T transversions at the third base of codon 249 of p53 were detected in Mahlavu and PLC/PRF/5 HCC lines, while a TAC to CAC mutation at codon 234 was observed in an allele of the Raji Burkitt lymphoma line",

    "Title": "p53 expression is associated with a high degree of tumor DNA aneuploidy and incidence of p53 gene mutation, and is localized tot he aneuploid component in colorectal carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "p53 protein expression was studied by immunoblotting in 34 colorectal carcinomas and 28 of the corresponding normal mucosas, and correlated with tumor DNA ploidy as measured by flow cytometry. p53 protein was detected in 35% (12/34) of the tumors; the normal mucosas were negative. Fifty-five percent (12/22) of the tumors examined for mutations within the four hotspots (exons 5-8) of the p53 gene had point mutations. p53 expression correlated significantly with the presence of p53 gene mutations; 67% (8/12) of the tumors with mutations expressed p53, whereas only one of 10 tumors where no mutations were detected expressed the protein (p=0.01). Four tumors with p53 gene mutations did not express p53. Fifty-nine percent (20/34) of the tumors were aneuploid. p53 expression correlated significantly with aneuploidy; a total of 55% (11/20) of the aneuploid tumors were positive for p53 compared to 7% (1/14) of the diploid tumors (p=0.009). All of the 11 highly aneuploid tumors (1.31 less-than-or-equal-to DNA index (DI); less-than-or-equal-to 1.86) expressed p53, whereas all of the 9 moderately aneuploid tumors (1.11 less-than-or-equal-to DI less-than-or-equal-to 1.29) were p53-negative. Flow cytometry was also used to resolve cell cycle- and ploidy specific p53 expression in nuclei in 4 aneuploid tumors. p53 expression in these tumors was confined to the aneuploid component, whereas the diploid component was negative. p53 was seen in nuclei in all phases of the cell cycle of proliferating aneuploid cells. Neither p53 expression nor tumor DNA ploidy were correlated with Dukes' stage (p=1.00 and 0.72, respectively). The data suggest that high levels of mutant p53 may play a causative role in the generation of highly aneuploid tumors.",

    "Abstract": "The frequency of p53 mutations in human primary gastric cancer was analyzed. RNA was extracted from 30 primary cancer tissues and RT-PCR was performed to amplify p53 cDNA. Codons 114 to 325 of p53, where well conserved and frequently mutating areas reside, were amplified using three sets of primers. RT-PCR products were analyzed for the presence of mutations by single strand conformation polymorphism assays. Sixteen of primary cancer samples showed shifted mobility in at least one of the analyzed areas. Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of p53 mutations in all samples with shifted mobility in single strand conformation polymorphism assays. Fourteen of the thirty samples had amino acid substitutions due to point mutations and/or frame shifts. Two samples had only a nonsense point mutation. Mutations were clustered in two different areas of die p53 gene, codons 135 to 185 on exon 5 and codons 261 to 285 on exon 8, with a diversity of mutation patterns. A simultaneously and independently performed immunohistochemical study of p53 expression in these cancer tissues showed a relatively good, but not an absolute, correlation with the presence of the mutated p53. The p53 mutation appears to be the first major alteration of cellular genes in human primary gastric cancer.",

    "Title": "Mutation and expression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in tumor samples and cancer cell lines: comparison of non-isotopic direct DNA sequencing, immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the nuclear phosphoprotein p53 are the most frequent genetic alterations in human solid tumors detected so far. These mutations are clustered in highly conserved domains spanning from exon 4 to 9 of the gene. A very precise method of detecting p53 mutations is to sequence these domains. However, 2 to 3 overlapping PCR-amplifications were needed to span the whole mutation-prone region. We used a very rapid non radioactive solid-phase DNA sequencing method starting from mRNA to sequence the p53 domains in both directions with T7 DNA-polymerase allowing detection of the heterozygous state, where one allele shows the wild-type sequence, the other a mutated one. First we sequenced four colon carcinoma cell lines with known p53 mutations and one T-cell-leukemia cell line with a heterozygous situation to validate our method. Using this method we sequenced the p53 gene (exons four to nine) from 16 primary colon carcinomas. Seven of these 16 (44%) carcinomas showed mutations in the p53 gene resulting in amino acid exchanges. One showed a silent mutation, another one showed two point mutations in the highly conserved domain of the p53 gene. These colorectal carcinomas have been examined for overexpression of the p53 protein using a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against p53 (PAb1801, PAb240, PAb421, PAb1620) by immunohistochemical analysis and immunoblotting. Furthermore, four colorectal cancer cell lines were examined by indirect immunofluorescence technique with the same mAb PAb1801 as used in histological staining. Analysis of 6 out of 15 (40%) tumor specimens revealed markedly positive p53 nuclear staining patterns using monoclonal antibody PAb1801. These data suggest that there is quite a good correlation between point mutation of the p53 gene and nuclear staining with monoclonal antibody PAb1801 detecting overexpressed p53 protein. Moreover, there is no convincing evidence that wild-type protein can be detected using the monoclonal antibodies PAb 1801 and PAb 1620.",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 suppressor -ene are the most common genetic lesion noted in human cancers and appear to be relatively common (30%) as somatic cell mutations in female breast cancer. p53 mutations have also been frequently reported in familial breast cancers as in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Males with breast cancer are far rarer than females. We investigated the mutational spectra of the p53 gene in male breast cancers. Of 10 samples analyzed for p53 mutations in exons 5, 6. 7 and 8, only two showed point mutations corresponding to amino acid residues 248 and 290. One of the point mutations turned out to be a silent change, thus representing only DNA polymorphism. Although the number of male breast cancer samples thus far examined is small, the p53 mutations in male breast cancer (10%), unlike females (30%), does not appear to be as frequent.",

    "Abstract": "Eleven human melanoma cell lines with different metastatic ability (both spontaneous and experimental) in nude mice, were analyzed for p53 mutations. Mutations in the conserved regions of the p53 gene were identified by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 5-9 and were verified by direct DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products. A mutation was detected in only one low metastatic melanoma cell line with a C->G transition at codon 278, resulting in a substitution of arginine for proline. Only this cell line reacted immunohistochemically with mouse monoclonal antibody PAb 1801, which is immunoreactive with human p53 protein. Another cell line with low metastatic potential showed loss of heterozygosity for p53 with the remaining allele being normal. No mutations were detected in the highly metastatic melanoma cell lines' We conclude that p53 mutations are infrequent in human melanomas and are not a prerequisite for the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype.",

    "Title": "A correlative study of p53 protein alteration and p53 gene mutation in glioblastoma multiforme",
    "Abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated in glioblastomas. Mutations within the p53 gene often result in aberrant expression of the p53 protein leading to protein accumulation within the nucleus of the cells which can be detected by immunochemistry. Many studies have correlated alterations of p53 protein expression with p53 gene mutations. Positive staining of tumor cells for p53 protein has been widely assumed, perhaps incorrectly, to signify the presence of p53 gene mutations. This study compared the immunostaining patterns for p53 protein in 37 glioblastomas with the molecular genetic data obtained by the single strand conformation polymorphism assay. p53 gene mutations were detected in 46% (17 of 37) of glioblastomas, while 65% (24 of 37) of glioblastomas were positive for protein accumulation by immunohistochemistry. Although 30 of 37 glioblastomas analyzed showed concordance for p53 protein expression and p53 gene mutations, a subset of seven glioblastomas showed discordant accumulation of the p53 protein in the absence of any detectable p53 gene mutations. The mdm-2 gene was assessed in 17 glioblastomas for gene rearrangements or amplification, but none were found. This result suggests that a mechanism other than p53 gene mutation can result in altered p53 protein expression",

    "Title": "Mutation and expression of the p53 gene in malignant melanoma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against p53 protein (PAb 24o, DO-I and PAb1801) were used to define the immunophenotype of 13 melanoma cell lines. Immunoreactions could be detected in 12 out of 13 cell lines by using the indirect immunofluorescence technique. In 7 of these the majority of cells displayed cytoplasmic staining whereas positive nuclei were detected in only a few cells. Two cell lines had predominantly nuclear reactivity, while the remaining 3 cell lines showed signals in both locations. Despite identical nuclear staining patterns, the 3 MAbs produced qualitatively distinct cytoplasmic immunoreactions. PAb240 and DO-1, which showed similar staining frequencies, appeared more sensitive in the detection of p53 protein than did PAb1801. Immunoprecipitations of lysates from each of the cell lines, with MAbs DO-1 and 1801 (which bind to both wild-type and mutant p53 species) detected 53-kDa proteins, whereas PAb240 (which recognizes the mutant conformation of the protein in this type of assay) detected 53-kDa proteins in only 4 cell lines. Nucleotide sequencing of exons 5 to 9 of TP53 in these latter cell lines showed that each has homozygous point mutations in the locus, whereas in the others no TP53 alterations were found. Three of the 4 mutations were C-to-T transversions, alterations possibly caused by damage from UV-light. Our findings indicate that immunostaining with p53 antibodies, although common in malignant melanoma, results from the presence of mutant p53 protein in about 30% of the cases tested. Neither immunostaining with PAb240 nor the patterns of intracellular distributions of the signals are sufficient to detect TP53 mutations",

    "Abstract": "Abnormalities of the tumor-suppressor p53 gene have been discovered in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is unclear, however, whether HCC related to chronic viral hepatitis is associated with p53 gene alterations. In this study, we have examined p53 abnormalities in HCC associated with hepatitis C and B virus (HCV and HBV) infections. Tissues from 18 HCC patients from several hospitals throughout the United States were collected (9 were HCV-infected, 5 were HBV-infected, 1 was HCV/HBV-infected, and 3 were non-virus-associated). Immunostaining with monoclonal pAb 1801 revealed expression of p53 protein in tumor-cell nuclei in one HCV-associated HCC, and in no case of HBV-associated HCC, while the nuclei of adjacent hepatocytes were negative. Using Hae III-digestion of chromosomal DNA, mutations at codon 249 were not found in any of 18 HCC tissues studied. Direct sequencing demonstrated a mutated codon 244 and a wild-type codon 249 in the conserved regions (exon 5-8) of p53 gene from the tumor tissue with nuclear p53 expression. By reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the expression of p53 mRNA was demonstrated in tumor cells from 10 out of 16 HCC tissues. In conclusion, the specific mutation at codon 249 with G to T transversion was not observed in the HCCs associated with HCV or HBV infections. In HBV or non-virus- associated HCCs studied, no other p53 gene abnormalities were found. A point mutation at codon 244 with G to A transition of p53 gene was detected in only one of 10 HCV-associated HCCs, which suggests that p53 mutations may not play a significant role in HCV- or HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis",

    "Abstract": "Mutation of the p53 tumour-suppressor gene in exons 5 through 8 was examined in 118 cases of gastric cancer (59 early gastric cancers and 59 advanced gastric cancers) using PCR-SSCP (polymerase-chain-reaction- single-strand-conformation polymorphism) analysis and direct sequencing. In early gastric cancer, mutations were found in 15 of 41 (37%) cases of the cohesive type, i.e., papillary adenocarcinoma, well to moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with solid nests or focal tubular structures, but were not detected in 18 cases of the non-cohesive type, i.e., signet-ring-cell carcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma growing in a scattered manner. In advanced gastric cancer, 25 of 59 (42%) cases of the cohesive type had p53 mutation. No significant association was found between p53 mutation and other histopathological parameters such as macroscopic classification, lymph- node involvement and depth of tumour invasion. Fifteen of 25 (60%) mutations in the advanced gastric-cancer group were accompanied by allele loss at the p53 gene locus. Eighty-three percent of mutations in early gastric cancer and 52% of mutations in advanced gastric cancer showed G:C-to-A:T transition, almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotide mutational hot spots, indicating that the spectrum of p53 mutation was similar to that of colorectal cancer. These data suggest that the p53 mutation occurs selectively in gastric cancer of the cohesive type from the intramucosal cancer stage",

    "Title": "Involvement of p53 gene mutations in human endometrial carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 gene are associated with a wide variety of human malignancies. Point mutation in one allele and loss of the remaining one generally lead to inactivation of p53 protein. A high frequency of allelic losses corresponding to the 17p13.3 region that contained the p53 gene sequence was also noted in human endometrial carcinoma. Thus, in order to confirm involvement of the p53 gene in endometrial carcinogenesis, we searched for nucleotide sequence change in this gene in 42 endometrial carcinomas that had been subjected to previous LOH analyses. Using the polymerase-chain-reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method, we detected p53 gene mutations in 4 specimens. Two adenocarcinomas with allelic loss on 17p contained a mutant p53 gene in the allele that was retained. One specimen with a p53 gene mutation contained a 17q deletion but was uninformative for LOH on 17p. p53 gene mutation was also noted in the remaining stage-I carcinoma, though the 17p deletion was not detected in the previous LOH examination. However, 5 specimens with the LOH on 17p retained the wild-type p53 gene. In the remaining 33 specimens, both alleles of p53 gene seemed to be normal. The mutations observed in 2 specimens (cases 10 and 24), involving C-to-T and T-to-G substitutions, were located in a highly conserved region. However, the mutations identified in the remaining 2 cases (29 and 35) were at regions positioned outside conserved stretches",

Point mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61 in H-ras, K-ras and N-ras proto-oncogenes were similarly assessed by direct DNA sequencing. Three out of 15 primary adrenocortical carcinomas (20%) contained a mis-sense point mutation in the conserved regions (exons 5 and 8) of the p53 gene. Mutations were located in codon 157 (GTC-->TTC; Val-->Phe), codon 163 (TAC-->AAC; Tyr-->Asn), and codon 273 (CGT-->TGT; Arg-->Cys). The mutation in codon 157 was detected in the primary tumor as well as in brain and lymph-node metastases. Among 18 adrenocortical adenomas, there was only a single non-miscoding mutation in codon 295 (CCT-->CCC; Pro-->Pro). These data suggest that mutational inactivation of the p53 gene occurs in a minority (20%) of sporadic adrenocortical carcinomas and that these mutations constitute a late event in the multi-step process of malignant transformation. No ras mutations were detected in any of these tumors, suggesting that these genes are not involved in the development of tumors originating from the adrenal cortex",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in, and aberrant expression of, the p53 tumor suppressor gene were assessed in 17 cell lines derived from human malignant brain tumors (glioblastoma multiforme). Exons 5 through 8 were screened by single strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP), followed by direct DNA sequencing. Mutations were found in 6 of 17 glioma cell lines, i.e., at a frequency similar to that found in primary malignant gliomas. Loss of the wild type allele was observed in 4 of the mutated cell lines. Two cell lines had the same mutation (CGG-->TGG; Arg-->Trp) in codon 248. Five of 6 mutations were transitions, 4 of which occurred at CpG dinucleotides. In one cell line a 10-bp deletion at the intron 4/exon 5 junction was found. Five of 6 glioma cell lines contained a mutation identical to that in the respective primary tumor despite prolonged in vitro culture (140-221 passages). Thus, the acquisition of p53 mutations during culture appears to be infrequent. Two cell lines derived from heterozygous tumors maintained the wild type p53 allele during long term culture. p53 protein levels were assessed by immunofluorescence cytochemistry and immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis and revealed elevated levels of the p53 protein, although to a variable extent, in all cell lines with p53 mutations. A marked p53 protein accumulation was also observed in two cell lines lacking p53 mutations in exons 5 through 8, indicating that a prolonged half life of the gene product is not solely dependent on an aberrant coding sequence. The remaining cell lines had either low levels or no detectable p53 protein; one of the latter contained a gross rearrangement of the p53 gene. Our results suggest that with respect to p53 gene status, glioma cell lines usually resemble the original tumors and may, therefore, be suitable for studying the biological changes associated with p53 mutations in glial tumors",

    "Abstract": "A variety of neoplasms of the human nervous system were analyzed for the presence of mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. DNA was extracted from frozen or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis for exons 5-8 was followed by direct DNA sequencing. Mutations leading to an amino acid change were found in three of 11 (27%) low-grade (World Health Organization (WHO) Grade II) astrocytomas. They were located in codon 183 (TCA-->TGA) of exon 5, codon 237 (ATG-->ATA) of exon 7, and codon 273 (CGT-->CAT) of exon 8. In one of these cases, the sequence indicated loss of the wild-type allele. Of 12 juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO Grade I), none contained a p53 mutation, suggesting a different molecular basis for this childhood neoplasm. Except for a mutation in one of seven (14%) meningeal hemangiopericytomas (codon 238; TGT-->TTT, Cys-->Phe), no mutations were observed in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene in any of the following tumors of the nervous system and its coverings: 13 schwannomas, 12 central neurocytomas, 22 meningiomas, 10 choroid plexus papillomas and carcinomas, and 30 neuroblastomas of the sympathetic nervous system. These and published data support the view that p53 mutations are frequently involved both in low-grade and progressive (anaplastic) astrocytomas, including glioblastomas multiforme. Oligodendrogliomas, medulloblastomas, meningiomas, and hemangiopericytomas rarely (< 15%) show p53 mutations in exons 5-8, whereas none of the remaining nervous system neoplasms revealed evidence of an involvement of the p53 gene in their development",

Mutations were identified by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing in 12 of 24 (50%) of the samples; almost half of the mutations were at A:T base pairs. Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein, determined by immunohistochemistry with the CM-1 polyclonal antibody, was observed in all cases in which a missense mutation in the p53 gene was detected. None of the 24 carcinomas had amplification of the mdm2 gene, an alternate pathway to p53 loss of function. Alterations involving three other cancer-related genes associated with human esophageal carcinogenesis, c-erbB-1/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c- myc, and retinoblastoma (Rb), were examined by Southern blot or immunohistochemical analysis in the same sample set to explore the possibility of a link between oncogene activation and loss of tumor suppressor function. While no associations were observed between amplification of the c-myc or EGFR genes and p53 abnormalities, a significant correlation (P < 0.01) was seen between the presence of p53 mutation and EGFR overexpression. Absence of Rb protein, measured immunohistochemically, was observed in four tumors, none of which had aberrations of the p53 gene",

    "Title": "Alterations of the Rb gene and its association with Ki-ras activation and p53 inactivation in endometrial adenocarcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Alterations of the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene were evaluated in nine primary endometrial adenocarcinomas that we had previously analyzed for the presence of Ki-ras activations and p53 alterations and in three endometrial carcinoma cell lines. Loss of mRNA expression in the Rb gene was detected in two of the 12 tumors. Internal deletions of Rb cDNA were observed in two tumors; one was a deletion of exon 21 in a primary carcinoma, and the other was a deletion of exon 8 in one allele in one cell line. Loss of heterozygosity of the Rb gene, which was detectable by polymorphisms in introns 1 and 17, was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 29 endometrial carcinomas. Of 13 heterozygous cases, two cases (15%) showed loss of heterozygosity. We therefore suggest that alteration of the Rb gene, as well as activation of the Ki-ras gene and alterations of the p53 gene, plays a significant role in the etiology of endometrial adenocarcinoma",

    "Title": "Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and the ras gene family in intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinomas in Japan and Thailand",
    "Abstract": "The incidence and pattern of mutations of the ras oncogenes and the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been shown to differ among different cancer types and even among the same cancer types with different etiological backgrounds. For example, in a previous study we showed that not only the etiology but also the incidence of point mutation of the c-Ki-ras oncogene in cholangiocellular carcinomas (CCCs) differ between Japanese and Thai patients. In the study presented here, we examined the incidence of mutations in the ras gene family and the p53 gene in CCCs of both Japanese and Thai patients by single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing analyses and compared the pattern of p53 mutation between these two CCC groups. Although the incidence of ras mutation differed markedly between Japanese (seven of 12, 58%) and Thai (two of 26, 8%) cases, the incidence of p53 mutation was similar: four of 12 (33%) and nine of 26 (35%), respectively. Except for one case in which deletion-insertion was detected in the second exon of the N-ras gene, all ras mutations occurred at codon 12 or 13 of the c-Ki- ras gene. All p53 mutations but one were detected in a highly conserved region, and the predominant form of the mutations was G:C-->A:T transition at CpG sites in both Japanese and Thai cases, similar to that reported for colorectal cancers. Therefore, in contrast to the ras oncogenes, mutation of the p53 gene was frequently involved in the development of CCCs in both Japanese and Thai patients, irrespective of any difference in etiology",

    "Title": "Absence of p53 mutations in childhood central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumors",
    "Abstract": "The primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the central nervous system is one of a number of tumors in which deletions on chromosome 17p have been identified. The tumor suppressor gene, p53, is located in the region of the deletion. To determine if the p53 gene is involved in the development of primitive neuroectodermal tumors, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) blot analysis, ribonucleic acid blot analysis, and p53 complementary DNA sequencing were performed on 34 primitive neuroectodermal tumors removed from children. No rearrangement in the gene was detected in 21 tumors. The p53 messenger ribonucleic acid was of the expected size in all 18 tumors for which ribonucleic acid was available. Sequencing of p53 Exons 5 through 9 revealed a mutation in the cell line DAOY and in only 1 of 14 tumors examined. A DNA rearrangement was detected in the DNA from one tumor with a probe mapping to the distal portion of 17p. Taken together, these data suggest that the p53 gene is not involved in the development of most primitive neuroectodermal tumors. In addition, a gene of interest may be present on distal 17p",

    "Title": "Frequency of p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations in human primary brain tumors",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most common genetic alterations found in diverse types of human cancer, including the primary malignant brain tumor, glioblastoma multiforme. To estimate the frequency of p53 mutations in human brain tumors, we screened 120 human primary brain tumors (59 astrocytic; 61 nonastrocytic) by the polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. Six astrocytic tumors (one anaplastic astrocytoma and five glioblastoma multiforme) were found to have putative p53 mutations. Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified deoxyribonucleic acid from these six tumors confirmed the presence of different point mutations in the conserved regions of the p53 gene. Allelic losses on chromosome 17p were detected in four (67%) of the six tumors with p53 mutations. p53 mutations were not detected in any of the 61 nonastrocytic brain tumors. Also, polymerase chain reaction- single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of 74 leukocyte deoxyribonucleic acid samples from patients with astrocytic and nonastrocytic brain tumors failed to detect any germ-line p53 mutations. We conclude from these findings that p53 gene mutations in brain neoplasms are primarily limited to tumors of astrocytic origin and that the p53 gene mutations in sporadic astrocytomas are somatic in origin (i.e., nonprenatally determined)",

    "Title": "The relation between p53 mutation and p53 immunostaining in non- melanoma skin cancer",
    "Abstract": "Extensive study of the p53 gene has established its role as a tumour- suppressor gene, and the involvement of mutant p53 in a wide spectrum of human malignancy. Many mutations of p53 result in a protein product that is abnormally stable, so that it becomes readily detectable by immunocytochemistry. In contrast, under normal conditions, it has been considered that levels of wild-type p53 were too low to be detectable. Although positive immunocytochemistry has been used as a marker of mutation, recent evidence suggests that this assumption may not always be valid. We have carried out both PCR-sequencing of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene in 20 basal cell carcinomas (BCC), and immunocytochemistry of these tumours with the anti-p53 antibody DO7. Twenty cases of Bowen's disease, in which we had previously documented mutations, were also immunostained. We report a low rate of p53 mutation in the BCCs we examined (2/20), and a discrepancy between tumours with positive immunostaining and those with mutation in both Bowen's disease and BCC. Of eight tumours in which we detected mutation, only four were immunopositive: of 19 immunopositive samples, only four showed detectable mutation. We discuss the implications of our results for the use of positive immunostaining in clinical diagnosis, and the involvement of p53 in skin carcinogenesis",

    "Abstract": "The frequency of simultaneously detecting N-ras and p53 gene mutations was studied in leukaemia cells of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Using in vitro DNA amplification followed by oligonucleotide hybridization analysis, 45 AML and six MDS patients were screened for activating mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61 of N-ras. Ten of them (eight AML and two MDS) were found positive. These 10 patients and 10 others without activating N- ras mutation were further analysed by direct sequencing of the amplified exons for p53 mutations and for atypical N-ras mutations. Beside the activating mutations in the N-ras gene, no additional transforming or nontransforming mutations could be detected in the N- ras. However, exon 7 of p53 was mutated in two AML patients without activating N-ras mutation. These data show that p53 mutations occurred with half the frequency of N-ras mutations in AML and that no positive correlation could be found between the onset of mutations in N-ras and p53 genes",

We examined eight established cell lines derived from cervical carcinomas for the presence of mutations of the p53 antioncogene in relation to the presence of HPV DNA sequences. Of these eight cell lines, seven were positive for HPV DNA and the remaining one was negative for HPV DNA. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analyses revealed a point mutation of the p53 gene in the cell line in which HPV DNA was absent. Sequencing analysis revealed a single-base mutation at codon 273 from CGT to CAT(Arg-->His) and immunocytochemical studies provided evidence that the p53 protein was overexpressed in this cell line. Our observations suggest that the loss of normal p53 gene function may be linked to the oncogenesis of cervical carcinoma",

    "Title": "Timing of p53 mutations during astrocytoma tumorigenesis",
    "Abstract": "Using a combination of polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism techniques (PCR-SSCP) we have analyzed 78 brain tumor samples (70 primary and 8 metastatic) for the presence of mutations in the conserved regions of the Tp53 (tumor p53) gene. We have found that only two groups, gliomas (exclusively in astrocytomas) and metastases, displayed Tp53 mutations. Three of eight (37.5%) metastases showed a mutant Tp53 allele accompanied by loss of the normal one. In contrast, the frequency of Tp53 mutations in the primary brain tumors examined was lower (5.7%). Although we have examined different types of primary brain tumors, Tp53 mutations were exclusively observed in both, low and high-grade astrocytomas (four of 24). The Tp53 mutations detected in astrocytic tumors appear to be correlated with the malignancy grade. The low-grade astrocytomas were heterozygous for the mutation, whereas the high-grade astrocytomas had affected the two Tp53 alleles, suggesting a two-steps model for inactivation of the p53 gene in astrocytomas. Thus, single p53 mutation seems to occur in initial stages of astrocytoma tumorigenesis; the later lost of the remaining wild-type allele appears associated with the progression towards a more malignant stage",

    "Title": "P53 mutation in acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia is of somatic origin and is stable during establishment of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Samples donated by patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T- ALL) were screened for mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Peripheral blood cells of T-ALL relapse patient H.A. were found to possess a heterozygous point mutation at codon 175 of the p53 gene. To determine whether this was an inherited mutation, a B cell line (HABL) was established. Leukemic T cell lines (HATL) were concurrently established by growing peripheral blood leukemic T cells at low oxygen tension in medium supplemented with IGF-I. Previously we had shown that > 60% of leukemic T cell lines possessed mutations in the p53 gene (Cheng, J., and M. Hass. 1990. Mol. Cell. Biol. 10:5502), mutations that might have originated with the donor's leukemic cells, or might have been induced during establishment of the cell lines. To answer whether establishment of the HATL lines was associated with the induction of p53 mutations, cDNAs of the HATL and HABL lines were sequenced. The HATL lines retained the same heterozygous p53 mutation that was present in the patient's leukemic cells. The HABL line lacked p53 mutations. Immunoprecipitation with specific anti-p53 antibodies showed that HATL cells produced p53 proteins of mutant and wild type immunophenotype, while the HABL line synthesized only wild-type p53 protein. The HATL cells had an abnormal karyotype, while the HABL cells possessed a normal diploid karyotype. These experiments suggest that (a) p53 mutation occurred in the leukemic cells of relapse T-ALL patient HA; (b) the mutation was of somatic rather than hereditary origin; (c) the mutation was leukemia associated; and (d) establishment of human leukemia cell lines needs not be associated with in vitro induction of p53 mutations. It may be significant that patient HA belonged to a category of relapse T-ALL patients in whom a second remission could not be induced",

    "Title": "High prevalence of mutations of the p53 gene in poorly differentiated human thyroid carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "The development and progression of thyroid tumors is signaled by phenotype-specific mutations of genes involved in growth control. Molecular events associated with undifferentiated thyroid cancer are not known. We examined normal, benign, and malignant thyroid tissue for structural abnormalities of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Mutations were detected by single-strand conformation polymorphisms of PCR- amplified DNA, using primers bracketing the known hot spots on either exons 5, 6, 7, or 8. The prevalence of mutations was as follows: normal thyroid 0/6; follicular adenomas 0/31; papillary carcinomas 0/37; medullary carcinomas 0/2; follicular carcinomas 1/11; anaplastic carcinomas 5/6; thyroid carcinoma cell lines 3/4. Positive cases were confirmed by direct sequencing of the PCR products. All five anaplastic carcinoma tissues and the anaplastic carcinoma cell line ARO had G:C to A:T transitions leading to an Arg to His substitution at codon 273. In both tumors and cell lines, examples of heterozygous and homozygous p53 mutations were identified. The only thyroid carcinoma cell line in which p53 mutations were not detected in exons 5-8 had markedly decreased p53 mRNA levels, suggesting the presence of a structural abnormality of either p53 itself or of some factor controlling its expression. The presence of p53 mutations almost exclusively in poorly differentiated thyroid tumors and thyroid cancer cell lines suggests that inactivation of p53 may confer these neoplasms with aggressive properties, and further loss of differentiated function",

    "Abstract": "The p53 gene was analyzed in tumor specimens obtained from 52 patients with various types of carcinoma of the thyroid gland by a combined molecular and immunocytochemical approach. The histologic types included 37 well-differentiated papillary and follicular carcinomas, 8 poorly differentiated, and 7 undifferentiated carcinomas. The p53 gene was shown to be unaffected in all differentiated tumors by single- strand conformation polymorphism analysis. However, in two out of eight (25%) of poorly differentiated carcinomas and five out of seven (71%) undifferentiated carcinomas, p53 mutations were identified and subsequently characterized by DNA sequencing. One undifferentiated carcinoma displayed two areas with varying degrees of differentiation. The comparative analysis of the p53 gene, in both the more and the less differentiated area of this tumor, clearly showed that the p53 mutation was confined to the latter component of the tumor specimen. These results indicate that mutations of the p53 gene are associated with the most aggressive histologic types of thyroid tumors, such as the undifferentiated carcinoma and, to a certain extent, the poorly differentiated carcinoma, and that the alterations of this gene represent a late genetic event in human thyroid carcinogenesis",

The observed loss of heterozygosity of the marker on chromosome 17p was 36% of the informative cases, while 58% of the tumors contained a mutation in p53. This might be an indication that the mutation in p53 precedes the loss involving p53 on the homologous chromosome. Four tumors showed the presence of two different missense mutations in the p53 gene; in one of them the mutations involved the first two nucleotides of one and the same codon, while in a second case they were found within the same exon. In the remaining two cases the assessment of their situation, cis or trans, was not feasible.

    "Abstract": "Mutations affecting the p53 gene are associated with many human malignancies, but little is known about changes in p53 in unknown primary tumors (UPTs), which are characterized as tumors with advanced stages of malignancy. We therefore investigated the frequency of p53 mutations in a series of 15 unknown primary tumor biopsies and eight cell lines established from UPTs. Mutations in the conserved regions of the p53 gene were verified by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 5-9 and were verified by direct DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products. A point mutation leading to an amino acid change in the p53 protein was found in six cases, and a mutation causing a change to termination was found in one case. A frameshift mutation was observed in one cell line. In one patient and one cell line we observed more than one mutation in the p53 coding sequence. Overall, the frequency of mutations that changed the p53 coding sequence in the UPTs we studied was 26% (6/23). Mutations were distributed in eight codons of the p53 gene. Seven of these tumors showed a reduction to homozygosity at the p53 allele, but one tumor apparently retained heterozygosity. We conclude that although UPTs represent highly metastatic advanced tumors that are expected to have a high incidence of p53 mutations, the frequency of p53 mutations is relatively low, suggesting that p53 mutations may not play a major role in the development and progression of this unique tumor type",

It is unclear whether phenacetin acts through chronic tissue damage (phenacetin nephropathy) or via a genotoxic metabolite causing promutagenic DNA lesions. In the present study, we investigated 15 urothelial carcinomas from 13 patients with evidence of phenacetin abuse. Tumors were screened for p53 mutations in exons 5-8 by single- strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, followed by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA. p53 Mutations were detected in 8/14 primary tumors (57%). All except one were missense mutations located in exon 5 (three mutations), exon 6 (one), exon 7 (two) and exon 8 (one). The type of mutation varied, with a preference for CpG sites. A frameshift mutation resulting from the insertion of a single cytosine at codons 151/152 was detected in a bladder tumor and its lung metastasis. Urothelial carcinomas located in the renal pelvis and in the ureter of the same patient exhibited two different mutations, strongly suggesting that they developed independently. Another patient had tumors in the renal pelvis and bladder, both of which contained the same p53 mutation, indicating intracavitary metastatic spread. This demonstrates that screening of p53 mutations allows the clonal origin of tumors in patients with multiple primary and metastatic lesions to be determined. None of the tumors investigated contained mutations in codons 12, 13 or 61 of H-ras or K-ras protooncogenes",

    "Abstract": "Allele losses and mutations have been examined in 38 cases of primary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) from different geographic areas of China by Southern, single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and direct DNA sequencing analyses. Two of 12 samples from Qi-Dong and six of 18 HCCs from Shanghai showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the loci on chromosome 17p13.3. All of the nine mutations in the p53 gene detected in HCC from Qi-Dong were clustered at the third base of codon 249, i.e. G:C to T:A, leading to an arginine to serine change. In contrast, 18 HCC samples from Shanghai contained three mutations at codons 249, 255 and 279. These results suggested a relationship between the spectrum of p53 aberration and environmental risk factors in these two geographic areas. Since no correlation between the state of HBV DNA and p53 aberration was observed, other factors such as dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) might be responsible for the mutational hotspot at codon 249 in HCCs from Qi-Dong area",

    "Abstract": "Although rodent cells have been immortalized following transfection with a mutant p53 gene, the role of p53 in the immortalization of human cells is unknown. Therefore, human epithelial cell lines were examined for p53 mutations in exons 4-9 which include the evolutionarily conserved regions. A spontaneously immortalized skin keratinocyte cell line, HaCat, and three ras-transfected clones, have a p53 mutational spectrum that is typical of ultraviolet light induced mutations. A normal finite lifespan cell strain (184) and two benzo[a]pyrene immortalized mammary epithelial cell lines derived from 184 (184A1 and 184B5) contain wild type p53 sequences in exons 4-9, although elevated levels of nuclear p53 indicate an alteration in the stability of the normally transient protein. Wild type p53 was found in human bronchial, esophageal and hepatic epithelial cells immortalized by SV40 T antigen gene and human renal epithelial cells immortalized by adenovirus 5. BEAS-2B, an SV40 T antigen immortalized bronchial epithelial cell line and two subclones, have a germline polymorphism at codon 47. Inactivation of p53 by mechanisms such as mutation or complexing with proteins of DNA tumor viruses appears to be important in the immortalization of human epithelial cells",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutation and integrated hepatitis B viral DNA sequences in human liver cancer cell lines",
    "Abstract": "A G:C-->T:A mutational hotspot at codon 249 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene has previously been identified in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of patients from Qidong, China and southern Africa in which aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are known synergistic risk factors. We have examined p53 mutation patterns of HCC from geographic areas in which the risk factors vary. Nine HCC lines and four hepatoblastoma lines (HB) were examined for p53 gene mutations and the relationship with HBV infection. Five of the nine HCC lines had homozygous mutation or deletion randomly distributed in exons 6-8, whereas none of the four HB cell lines had p53 mutations. One of the four HB lines (HepG2) had an N-ras mutation at codon 61 position 2. The p53 point mutations in the three HCC cell lines from Japan resulted in the amino acid changes of cysteine for tyrosine in cell line HuH 7 at codon 220 (A:T-->G:C), alanine for glycine in cell line HLF at codon 244 (G:C-->C:G), and serine for arginine in cell line HLE at codon 249 (G:C-->C:G). In addition, the deletion of 18 base pairs from codon 264 position 3 to codon 270 position 1 has resulted in the deletion of Leu- Gly-Arg-Asn-Ser-Phe from the amino acids sequences 256-270 in the Japanese cell line HuH 4. The cell line PLC/PRF/5 that showed p53 mutation at codon 249 (G:C-->T:A) with substitution of serine for arginine was derived from a South African patient. Our results indicate that whereas the p53 gene is not mutated in the HB cell lines, the HCC cell lines frequently contain an abnormal p53 gene. In addition, p53 point mutations were not detected in the four Japanese HCC cell lines that were positive for genomic integration of HBV X-gene and surface antigen gene. The three Japanese HCC cell lines with p53 mutations did not contain HBV sequences, indicating that hepatocarcinogenesis associated with p53 mutation does not require the genomic integration of HBV sequences",

    "Title": "Mutations of the p53 gene in carcinomas of the urinary system",
    "Abstract": "Deletion of p53, which is an anti-oncogene located on chromosome 17p, was reported to be present at a high incidence in tumor cells of colorectal carcinoma, as well as osteosarcoma of the familial cancer syndrome. Mutations of the p53 gene were investigated in 59 surgical specimens of primary carcinomas of the urinary system from 57 patients, using the polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. The PCR products were sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method or the DNA sequencer. The tumors examined were 20 transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) and 39 renal cell carcinomas (RCC). Mutations of the p53 gene were detected in 20.0% (4/20) of TCC and were present in 16.7% (1/6) of the tumors invading the muscular layer. In two patients with simultaneous double bladder TCC, the mutations were found only in the larger tumors. In RCC, mutations were detected in 7.7% (3/39) of patients. No significant correlation between the presence of the mutation and the clinicopathologic parameters was found in RCC except that the three tumors with p53 gene mutations were clear cell carcinomas. These results suggest that p53 gene mutations play a possible role in both carcinogenesis and progression of TCC, but the p53 gene mutations may not be significant in development of RCC",

    "Abstract": "Accumulation of p53 protein resulting in levels detectable by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been proposed as an indicator of mutation of the p53 gene. We have investigated a panel of 23 fresh- frozen breast cancers by IHC (PAb 1801), Southern and Northern blot analysis, and direct sequencing of the mutation hot spot regions (exons 5-8) of the p53 gene. Three tumors (13%) showed an intense nuclear staining in the majority of malignant cells, but only one of these showed a mutation of the p53 gene (codon 237, Arg to His). Furthermore, a mutation (5-bp deletion) was identified in a tumor that showed no p53 immunoreactivity. Our results indicate that accumulation of p53 protein, as detectable by IHC, is not a reliable indicator for p53 gene mutation in human breast cancer",

    "Abstract": "We examined five cases of verrucous carcinoma (VC) and two cases of giant condyloma of Buschke-Lowenstein (GCBL) associated with invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ISCC), by immunocytochemistry and molecular techniques. Neither human papillomavirus (HPV) footprints nor p53- altered expression and/or mutation were observed among the cases of VC. By contrast, both cases of GCBL with ISCC turned out to be HPV 6 or 11 positive, showed overexpression of p53 and, one of the two, a mutation in the nucleotide sequence of this tumor suppressor gene. The results point out that VC and GCBL with ISCC, in spite of some morphologic similarities, are two distinct entities, the former being unrelated to both HPV and p53 inactivation and the latter related to both. Regarding p53, immunocytochemical and molecular data on GCBL with ISCC suggest a role of mutant p53 in the progression of malignancy into invasion",

    "Abstract": "Overexpression and point mutation of the p53 protein/gene was investigated in a series of chondrosarcoma by an immunohistochemical approach, and direct sequencing of the genomic DNA, respectively. In 2 of the 16 cases studied, both of which were high grade chondrosarcomas (grade III), immunodetectable p53 was identified. Histologically, one was ordinary type and the other a clear cell variant. However, no positivity was observed in the other cases including nine of low grade, ordinary type, three of low grade, clear cell type, and two of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma. Direct sequencing, following polymerase chain reaction amplification of exons 5-9 of the p53 gene in 14 cases, in which fresh materials were available, successfully demonstrated base substitution mutations in only two cases with detectable p53 overexpression on immunohistochemistry. Their details were GTC (valine) to TTC (phenylalanine) at codon 157 in exon 5, and CGT (arginine) to CAT (histidine) at codon 273 in exon 8. No mutation was detected in the other 12 cases which were negative for p53 immunostaining. These findings strongly suggest that p53 mutation plays a crucial role in the biologically aggressive subtype, and possibly in the process of tumor progression in human chondrosarcoma",

    "Title": "p53 point mutations in dysplastic and cancerous ulcerative colitis lesions",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The molecular basis of colorectal dysplasia and carcinoma arising in ulcerative colitis is poorly understood. Loss of heterozygosity involving the tumor suppressor gene p53 occurs frequently in neoplastic ulcerative colitis lesions. Point mutation affecting p53 is associated with loss of heterozygosity in other cancers. Therefore, it was determined whether p53 point mutation occurs in ulcerative colitis-associated neoplasia. METHODS: Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, DNA sequencing, and loss of heterozygosity studies were performed on 45 patients with ulcerative colitis-associated dysplasia and carcinoma. RESULTS: Point mutations were detected in 26 lesions from 20 patients, including 18 carcinomas, 6 dysplasia-associated masses, 1 flat dysplasia, and 1 lymph node metastasis. In two cases, identical p53 mutations were observed in both carcinoma and adjacent dysplasia. Missense mutations causing amino acid substitutions as well as nonsense mutations resulting in premature stop codons were seen. Tandem mutations, in which more than 1 sequence alteration occurred on the same allele of p53, were also detected. Point mutation was accompanied by loss of the other p53 allele in 8 of 10 patients informative for both loss of heterozygosity and mutation assays. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that inactivation of p53 by mutation and loss of heterozygosity is a common mechanism of malignant transformation in ulcerative colitis. They also imply that in contrast to sporadic colorectal carcinoma, ulcerative colitis-associated neoplastic progression may involve p53 inactivation at relatively early, noninvasive stages",

    "Title": "Aberrant expression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV-I-infected cells",
    "Abstract": "By immunoprecipitation analysis, enhanced p53 expression was detected in 3 of 4 adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cell lines, 1 of 3 HTLV-I- infected cell lines and 1 of 5 fresh ATL samples, compared with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Among these 5 high expressers, p53 missense mutations were indicated in 2 ATL cell lines and 1 fresh ATL sample by extensive p53 cDNA and genomic DNA polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. No mutation was found throughout the entire coding region of the remaining 2 high expressers (1 ATL and 1 HTLV-I-infected cell lines) and low expressers of p53 (2 HTLV-I-infected cell lines). Tax oncoprotein expression was found in these 2 high p53 expressers in which p53 mutation was not present, but not in low p53 expressers or cells carrying this mutation. The levels of p53 mRNA were similar among the samples regardless of p53 levels. Posttranscriptional mechanisms other than missense mutation would thus appear to increase p53 in the Tax-expressing cells but not in cells containing undetectable levels of Tax. No complex formation between p53 and Tax was observed",

    "Abstract": "Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosomes 1p, 4q, 5q, 8p, 13q, 16q, 17p, and 22q, and mutation of the p53 gene were simultaneously analyzed in 63 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) with distinct histopathological grades, 80% of the tumors being from patients who had been exposed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). The frequencies of LOH on 8 chromosomes were 0-25% in 10 well differentiated HCCs, LOH being observed on 4q, 5q and 17p, 21-53% in 26 moderately differentiated HCCs, LOH on 8p and 17p being high, and 29-75% in 27 poorly differentiated HCCs, LOH on 17p, 4q and 8p being the most frequent. p53 gene mutation was detected in moderately and poorly differentiated HCCs at 15% and 52%, respectively, but not at all in well differentiated HCCs. Of the mutations detected, 42% were transition mutation and only 5% were CpG transition, in contrast to the high frequencies of these types of mutations in colon tumors (78% and 54%, respectively). LOH on every chromosome and p53 mutation were more frequent in more advanced tumors, and accumulation of genetic changes increased with increase of the histopathological grade. Frequency of genetic changes in HCCs from HBV-positive patients was comparable to that from HCV-positive patients. The present results suggest that accumulation of genetic changes in multiple tumor suppressor genes, especially LOH on 17p, 4q and 8p, and mutation in p53 gene, are involved in the progression of liver cancer, and LOH on 17p and 4q precedes other genetic changes. Differences in the direction of p53 mutation between HCC and colon carcinoma suggest that liver carcinogens are distinct from colon carcinogens. Furthermore, mechanisms affecting the frequency of LOH in HCCs in HBV-infected patients may be similar to those in HCV-infected patients",

    "Abstract": "In order to clarify the clinical significance of mutations of the p53 gene and amplification of the c-erbB-2 gene in breast carcinoma, these gene alterations were examined in 101 invasive, seven predominantly intraductal and 10 intraductal breast carcinomas by single-strand conformation polymorphism-direct sequencing or Southern blot- hybridization analysis. p53 mutations were detected in 32 (32%) of the invasive cases and two (12%) of the 17 intraductal/predominantly intraductal cases, whereas c-erbB-2 amplification was detected in 14 (14%) of the invasive and six (35%) of the intraductal/predominantly intraductal cases. Irrespective of differences in the positions and types of the mutations, cases carrying p53 mutations were almost always Grade 3 histologically and with a low hormone-receptor value. Since p53 mutations as well as c-erbB-2 amplification were detected almost selectively in Grade 3 cases but were not associated with lymph nodal status in invasive breast cancer, these two gene alterations could be indicators of prognosis of disease independent of lymph nodal status. Even in intraductal/predominantly intraductal carcinoma, these gene alterations were almost always detected in tumors of higher histologic grade. Thus, it is suggested that these gene alterations occur in breast cancers showing a high proliferation rate irrespective of the presence of invasion, and that other molecular alterations are involved in the process of breast cancer invasion",

We have previously reported positive p53 immunostaining in Bowen's disease and actinic keratosis. To determine if this abnormal immunostaining reflects p53 mutation or alternative pathways of p53 protein inactivation we have performed direct sequencing of p53 in 20 further cases of Bowen's disease. We found eight mutations in 20 cases, seven of which would produce alterations in the p53 protein product. Our results suggest that p53 mutation is an early event in malignant conversion, frequently preceding invasion in squamous cell neoplasia of the skin.

    "Title": "Spectrum of mutation and frequency of allelic deletion of the p53 gene in ovarian cancer",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The p53 gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein present in low levels in normal human cells. The wild-type form of this protein functions to restrain inappropriate cellular proliferation. Approximately one half of human epithelial ovarian cancers have mutations in the p53 gene and overexpress the mutant protein product. Deletion of one allele of the p53 gene also frequently occurs in these cancers. PURPOSE: We sought to define the spectrum of mutations in the p53 gene in epithelial ovarian cancer with respect to both the specific codons involved and the type of mutations observed. We also examined the frequency of allelic deletion of the p53 gene in cancers containing p53 gene mutations. METHODS: Tissue samples from the epithelial ovarian cancers of 62 patients were obtained during initial laparotomy. Histologic examination was done to ensure that the experimental samples used in this study contained more than 75% cancer cells. Total RNA was extracted from these samples and separately from matched control noncancerous regions of the surgical specimen or white blood cells. The purified RNAs were reverse transcribed to generate cDNA copies of exons 4-10 of the p53 gene. Two rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were conducted to produce enough template for DNA sequence analysis of the regions of interest within the p53 gene. Dideoxy sequencing of at least two independent productions of each amplified DNA template was done to confirm the validity of the mutations found. Allelic deletions were identified by PCR and gel electrophoretic techniques to examine three polymorphisms within the p53 gene in cancer-normal DNA pairs. RESULTS: We identified 45 mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene, where mutations frequently have been found in other cancer types. An additional mutation was identified in exon 4. Overall, 72% of the mutations were transitions, 24% transversions, and 4% microdeletions. Allelic deletion of the other p53 allele was seen in 67% of ovarian cancers in which a p53 mutation was present. Germ-line p53 mutations were not found in any patients whose cancers had p53 mutations. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Like p53 mutations in other types of human cancers, those in epithelial ovarian cancers are diverse and occur frequently in exons 5-8. The predominance of transition mutations suggests that p53 mutations in ovarian cancer arise because of spontaneous errors in DNA synthesis and repair rather than the direct interaction of carcinogens with DNA. These molecular data are consistent with data from epidemiologic studies that have failed to demonstrate a convincing relationship between exposure to environmental carcinogens and the development of ovarian cancer",

    "Title": "p53 protein accumulation and gene mutation in the progression of human prostate carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein has been shown to be strongly associated with missense p53 mutations. Studies of nuclear accumulation of p53 protein in prostate carcinoma cells have to date been confined to material from primary tumors. PURPOSE: We studied the accumulation of p53 protein in specimens obtained from primary and metastatic sites of prostate carcinoma. By examining the accumulation of this protein as a function of stage, histologic grade, and androgen responsiveness of the tumor, we hoped to determine the role of p53 mutation in the progression of prostate carcinoma. METHODS: The accumulation of the p53 protein in the cell nuclei was determined by immunohistochemical methods using polyclonal antibody to human p53 CM- 1. The material studied consisted of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue obtained from primary tumors and metastases of 92 patients with prostate carcinoma. Twelve samples from 11 patients were analyzed for the presence of mutations within exons 5-8 of the p53 gene (also known as TP53) by polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. Sequence analysis was subsequently performed on DNA obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of PCR-SSCP reactions produced from six different specimens. The chi- square test, Fisher's exact test, and the Freeman Halton test were used for statistical analyses of the results. RESULTS: All tumors with p53 accumulation were metastatic (stage D), poorly differentiated, and androgen independent. Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein was strongly associated with stage (D2 versus D1 versus A-C, P < .0001), grade (Gleason score 8-10 versus 5-7, P < .003), and androgen sensitivity (androgen independent versus dependent, P < .0001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that androgen sensitivity predicted p53 outcome better than did stage (P < .0001) or grade alone (P < .006). There was a perfect concordance between the results obtained by PCR-SSCP analysis and the p53 protein accumulation determined by immunohistochemistry in the 12 samples studied. Mutation of the p53 gene was confirmed by sequencing DNA obtained from six specimens positive in the PCR-SSCP assay. CONCLUSIONS: p53 gene mutation is a late event in the progression of prostate cancer and is associated with advanced (metastatic) stage, loss of differentiation, and the transition from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent growth. IMPLICATION: Testing of prostate cancer biopsy specimens from metastatic sites for p53 protein accumulation and gene mutation may provide useful prognostic information and could influence the recommended course of treatment",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mutation and overexpression of the p53 gene occur in approximately 20% of endometrial carcinomas. To determine whether alteration of the p53 gene is an early event in endometrial carcinogenesis, we examined the p53 gene in endometrial hyperplasias. STUDY DESIGN: Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from 117 endometrial hyperplasias (36 simple, 40 complex, 41 atypical) and 30 endometrial cancers. Exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene were amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction. Mutations in the p53 gene were sought with single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis and confirmed by direct deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing. RESULTS: None of 117 endometrial hyperplasias were found to have mutations in the p53 gene, whereas mutations were seen in three of 30 (10%) endometrial cancers (p < 0.02). The p53 mutations seen in three cancers were confirmed by direct sequencing (codons 157, 180, 272). CONCLUSION: Because it does not appear to be a feature of endometrial hyperplasias, mutation of the p53 gene may represent a relatively late event in endometrial carcinogenesis",

However, p53 mutations were not detected in fresh lymphocytes and B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from four BS patients carrying high sister chromatid exchange (SCE) levels, using Southern blot and DNA sequencing of exons 5-9.

    "Abstract": "Sixty-five tumors of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast were examined for p53 alteration by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (RT-PCR-SSCP) method and sequencing analysis. In total, 16 samples (24.6%) showed p53 gene alteration. Sixteen of these alterations were evaluated by sequencing analysis, and 15 showed missense point mutations while one showed a 9-base pair deletion. In the 15 point mutations, G:C to A:T transitions constituted the majority (53%), and five tumors (33%) had a transition at the CpG site, which are mutational patterns not commonly found in breast tumors from Europe and America. On the other hand, there were no G:C to T:A transversions in our cases, which were frequently observed transversions in Europe and America. These p53 mutation patterns in breast cancer in Japan are not similar to those in Europe and America reported by Hollstein et al. and Coles et al..

    "Title": "William L. McGuire Memorial Symposium. The role and prognostic significance of p53 gene alterations in breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "Alterations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most frequent genetic changes found in breast cancer, with an incidence reported in a range of 15 to 50%. The incidence of p53 alterations is approximately 15% for in situ carcinoma, while for invasive node-positive disease it is 2 to 3 times higher. This high rate of alteration suggests that the gene plays a central role in the development of breast cancer. The p53 gene functions as a negative regulator of cell growth. Alterations in the gene lead to loss of its usual negative growth regulation and more rapid cell proliferation. Since p53 alteration can reflect a more advanced state of progression and a higher rate of proliferation, breast tumors that have a p53 alteration could have a greater probability of having micrometastasis. p53 alterations could therefore be a prognostic factor for recurrence after primary local therapy. Consistent with this hypothesis, several independent studies using different methodologies have found that breast tumors with altered p53 have a worse prognosis and are also more likely to have other poor prognostic factors",

    "Abstract": "In order to know the involvement of multiple gene alterations in the pathogenesis of human lung cancer, we examiend the genes of K-, H-ras (codons 12, 13, 61), p53 (exons 5-9) and the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (B) (exons 20-22) using the polymerase chain reaction/singlestrand conformation polymorphism method in 32 human lung cancer cell lines (5 squamous-cell carcinomas, 10 adenocarcinomas, 3 large-cell carcinomas, 1 small-cell carcinomas).  In 18 non-small-cell lung cancer lines, gene alterations were found in 4 for K-ras (22%), none for H-ras (0%), 4 for p53 (22%) and none for the RB (0%) gene.  In 14 small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) lines, no gene alterations were found in K-ras (0%), or H-ras (0%) but 6 were found for p53 (43%) and 3 for the RB (21%) gene. Coincident abnormalities of K-ras and p53, or K-ras and RB genes were not found in any cell lines, and those of the p53 and RB genes were found in only 2 SCLC lines.  No association was observed between these three gene alterations and N-myc amplification.  Although the above three genes may be involved to some extent in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, more factors are required for its development.",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in all stages of thyroid carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "The p53 gene has been implicated as a tumor suppressor gene whose inactivation by mutations has been noted in a variety of human malignancies. Using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of cDNA fragments amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we analyzed 57 thyroid tumor specimens (8 follicular adenomas and 49 carcinomas) for the presence of mutations in exons 5, 6, 7, and 8 of p53 gene. Twelve of 49 (24.5%) of the thyroid carcinomas tested presented a mutated p53 allele, but none of the 8 benign thyroid tumors did. Mutations were found in 1 of 5 anaplastic carcinomas and 11 of 44 differentiated carcinomas. Three of these 11 differentiated tumor specimens showed foci of solid tissue with evidence of dedifferentiation. Two samples (1 with anaplastic carcinoma, the other with papillary carcinoma) had double mutations on the same allele resulting in a frameshift. Most mutations were point mutations, and 50% of those were G:C to A:T transitions. Seventy-five percent of the mutations were in exons 7 and 8. The presence of p53 mutations was not associated with tumor stage or histological type. Our data suggest that p53 mutations are involved in thyroid carcinogenesis and may play an important role in the malignant transformation of thyroid cells as well as thyroid tumor progression",

    "Title": "Comparative study of p53 gene and protein alterations in human astrocytic tumors",
    "Abstract": "The p53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene involved in many common malignancies, including astrocytomas. Genetic analysis of the p53 gene and immunohistochemistry of the p53 protein have each been used to screen astrocytomas. To compare these methods, we performed immunohistochemistry with the monoclonal antibody PAb 1801 and single- strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) with sequence analysis on 34 astrocytic tumors (WHO grades II, III and IV). Seven cases had detectable p53 protein and gene mutations, while twelve cases had neither detectable protein nor gene mutations. Four tumors had frameshift mutations in the p53 gene that were not revealed by immunohistochemistry. One tumor had a genetic polymorphism and no detectable p53 protein. Ten tumors had p53 protein accumulation but no mutations by SSCP; these cases may represent p53 mutations outside of the conserved exons or elevated levels of wild-type p53 protein. Thus, some p53 mutations are missed with PAb 1801 immunohistochemistry alone. p53 immunohistochemistry, however, may reveal p53 accumulation independent of mutations in the conserved portions of the gene. Finally, we suggest that glioblastomas with p53 mutations in the conserved region of the gene may be a subset that are more common in women and in younger patients",

    "Abstract": "Brain stem gliomas are pediatric astrocytomas that histologically resemble adult supratentorial astrocytomas such as glioblastomas multiforme (GBM). Our molecular genetic studies have suggested that adult GBM can be divided into two genetic subsets: tumors with p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations and chromosome 17p loss that occur more commonly in younger patients; and tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification that occur more commonly in older patients. Brain stem gliomas have not been studied since biopsies of these tumors are rare and extremely small. We investigated the molecular genetic composition of seven brain stem glioblastomas (two small biopsies, five autopsies) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for chromosomal loss, gene mutation and gene amplification. Four cases lost portions of chromosome 17p that included the p53 gene. These four cases and one additional case had mutations in the p53 gene. None of the cases showed amplification of the EGFR gene. Allelic losses of the long arm of chromosome 10 were noted in four cases. These results suggest similarities between pediatric brain stem glioblastomas and those GBM that occur in younger adult patients, and confirm the utility of PCR-based means of studying small and archival brain tumor specimens",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations and protein accumulation in human ovarian cancer",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 gene on chromosome 17p are a common genetic change in the malignant progression of many cancers. We have analyzed 38 malignant tumors of ovarian or peritoneal mullerian type for evidence of p53 variations at either the DNA or protein levels. Genetic studies were based on single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing of exons 2 through 11 of the p53 gene; mutations were detected in 79% of the tumors. These data show a statistically significant association between mutations at C.G pairs and a history of estrogen therapy. Two of 20 patients whose normal tissue could be studied carried germ-line mutations of p53. Immunohistochemical analysis of the p53 protein was carried out using monoclonal antibody PAb1801. Ninety-six percent of the missense mutations were associated with abnormal accumulation of p53 protein, but nonsense mutations, a splicing mutation, and most deletions did not result in p53 protein accumulation. A statistically significant association between p53 protein accumulation in poorly differentiated stage III serous carcinomas and small primary tumor size at diagnosis was found, perhaps suggesting that p53 protein accumulation accelerates the metastatic spread from a primary tumor. Overall, our findings indicate that alterations of p53 play a major role in ovarian cancer, including predisposition to the disease in some patients, and suggest a possible mechanism for somatic mutations leading to this cancer",

    "Title": "Mutation of p53 in primary biopsy material and cell lines from Hodgkin disease",
    "Abstract": "The p53 tumor-suppressor gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that arrests cell cycle progress at G1. It may facilitate DNA damage repair and is frequently mutated in many human tumors. Hodgkin disease, a malignant condition of the lymphoid system, is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells and mononuclear variants (Hodgkin cells), whose etiology remains unknown. The large multinucleated Reed- Sternberg cells often comprise < 1% of the total cell population within a biopsy specimen and are thought to be the neoplastic component in an admixture of reactive cells. It has been shown in the large majority of cases that up to 60% of these multinucleated cells react with CM-1, an anti-p53 antibody. However, whether this 'overexpression' of p53 protein reflects abnormality at the DNA level can no longer be assumed by immunocytochemistry alone. p53 from six Hodgkin disease-derived cell lines was examined by immunoprecipitation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and sequencing. In one cell line, point mutations were identified in exons 5 and 8 of p53. Sequencing of cloned PCR products confirmed the mutations to be on different alleles. A strategy involving extraction of nuclei followed by enrichment by flow cytometry was used to determine whether p53 overexpression in the Reed-Sternberg cells from patient biopsy material was due to mutations in this gene. Single-strand conformation polymorphism revealed additional bands in the polyploid nuclear preparations, suggesting abnormalities, and sequence analysis confirmed the presence of point mutations",

    "Abstract": "To identify the sites in the p53 tumor suppressor gene most susceptible to carcinogenic mutation by sunlight, the entire coding region of 27 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) of the skin was sequenced. Fifty-six percent of tumors contained mutations, and these were UV-like: primarily CC-->TT or C-->T changes at dipyrimidine sites. Such mutations can alter more than half of the 393 amino acids in p53, but two-thirds occurred at nine sites at which mutations were seen more than once in BCC or in 27 previously studied squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. Seven of these mutation hotspots were specific to skin cancers. Internal-cancer hotspots not located at dipyrimidine sites were not mutated in skin cancers; moreover, UV photoproducts were absent at these nucleotides. The existence of hotspots altered the process of inactivating p53 in BCC compared to other cancers: allelic loss was rare, but 45% of the point mutations were accompanied by a second point mutation on the other allele. At least one of each pair was located at a hotspot. Sunlight, acting at mutation hotspots, appears to cause mutations so frequently that it is often responsible for two genetic events in BCC development",

    "Title": "Specific UV-induced mutation spectrum in the p53 gene of skin tumors from DNA-repair-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum patients",
    "Abstract": "The UV component of sunlight is the major carcinogen involved in the etiology of skin cancers. We have studied the rare, hereditary syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), which is characterized by a very high incidence of cutaneous tumors on exposed skin at an early age, probably due to a deficiency in excision repair of UV-induced lesions. It is interesting to determine the UV mutation spectrum in XP skin tumors in order to correlate the absence of repair of specific DNA lesions and the initiation of skin tumors. The p53 gene is frequently mutated in human cancers and represents a good target for studying mutation spectra since there are > 100 potential sites for phenotypic mutations. Using reverse transcription-PCR and single-strand conformation polymorphism to analyze > 40 XP skin tumors (mainly basal and squamous cell carcinomas), we have found that 40% (17 out of 43) contained at least one point mutation on the p53 gene. All the mutations were located at dipyrimidine sites, essentially at CC sequences, which are hot spots for UV-induced DNA lesions. Sixty-one percent of these mutations were tandem CC-->TT mutations considered to be unique to UV- induced lesions; these mutations are not observed in internal human tumors. All the mutations, except two, must be due to translesion synthesis of unrepaired dipyrimidine lesions left on the nontranscribed strand. These results show the existence of preferential repair of UV lesions [either pyrimidine dimers or pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts] on the transcribed strand in human tissues",

A total of 15 mutations were detected in 8 cases, of which 5 revealed multiple or tandem mutations. The mutations included 6 G:C-A:T and 4 A:T-G:C transitions and 4 G:C-T:A and 1 A:T-T:A transversions. There was only 1 transition at the CpG site. Normal tissues of the same patients revealed no mutation, suggesting that these mutations were somatic, but not of germ line, in nature. The pattern of mutation characterized by frequent multiple or tandem occurrence, predominancy of transition at non-CpG sites and relatively frequent transversions suggested that pontine glioma might be related with some mutagenic or carcinogenic agents",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to determine the incidence of p53 and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene mutations and human papillomavirus infection in squamous cell carcinoma and adjacent normal mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract. The secondary objective was to associate these findings with clinical and histopathologic features. DESIGN: Point mutations of p53 were identified by single- strand conformation polymorphism analysis and confirmed by direct DNA sequence analysis. Polymerase chain reaction-based methods were used to identify loss of heterozygosity of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene and the presence of human papillomavirus sequences. SETTING: University-based tertiary care center. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five consecutive cases of upper aerodigestive tract squamous cell carcinoma. RESULTS: Eleven point mutations of p53 were identified in tumor samples (24%). No functional p53 mutations were detected in adjacent normal tissue from eight of these individuals nor was there evidence of p53 alteration in normal tissue adjacent to 12 of 30 additional tumors tested that demonstrated conformational alterations by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. The p53 mutations were significantly associated with local invasion. Loss of heterozygosity (which has a 20% chance of random occurrence in tumors) was detected at the retinoblastoma locus in 15% of the tumors tested. Five of the specimens (11%) were positive for human papillomavirus sequences (two of which also contained p53 mutations). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that p53 but not retinoblastoma or human papillomavirus is an important prognostic factor and is involved as a late event in the pathogenesis of upper aerodigestive tract squamous cell carcinoma",

Three (30%) of the ten gastric adenomas had p53 gene mutations, one adenoma showing a frameshift mutation and two others showing silent mutations. In addition, two missense mutations occurred in the carcinoma arising in an adenoma. Histologically, the adenomas containing silent mutations revealed moderate dysplasia. Immunoreactivity to p53 protein was also examined in 61 gastric adenomas, 19 carcinomas arising in adenomas and 48 early well-differentiated adenocarcinomas of the stomach (these included the tumors analyzed by deoxynucleotide sequencing). No staining for p53 was seen in the pure adenomas, but positive immunoreactivity was observed in 27% of the adenocarcinomas and 10.5% of the carcinomas arising in adenomas. These results suggest that p53 gene mutation is an early event in gastric carcinogenesis and missense mutation may play a crucial role in the conversion from adenoma to adenocarcinoma",

The sensitivity of this approach was validated by testing mutations previously identified by direct sequencing. Applying this assay, 40 samples of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors, including 33 gastrointestinal carcinoids and seven endocrine pancreatic tumors, were screened. Only one mutation (codon 283, CGC to CCC) was identified in a single clinically benign rectal carcinoid. This mutation occurred during the development of the tumor and was accompanied by loss of the wild-type gene. Our data indicate, that, in contrast to gastrointestinal carcinomas, alterations of the p53 gene are infrequent events in the development of gastrointestinal and pancreatic carcinoids. In addition, there was no evidence for the involvement of p53 in the malignant metastatic progression of carcinoids",

    "Title": "Alterations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in diffuse large cell lymphomas with translocations of the c-MYC and BCL-2 proto-oncogenes",
    "Abstract": "Diffuse large cell lymphomas are aggressive tumors of B-cell origin. In some cases they arise from low-grade follicular lymphomas carrying the t(14;18) translocation, an event that leads to the overexpression of the BCL-2 gene product. More frequently, however, they lack the t(14;18) translocation. Rearrangements of the c-MYC proto-oncogene and mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene have also been documented in these lymphomas. This study examines the extent to which alterations in the BCL-2, c-MYC, and p53 genes co-exist within individual lymphomas. Eight diffuse large cell lymphoma cell lines and 11 diffuse large cell lymphoma tumors were assessed for genetic alterations in these three genes. Our results indicate that there is a heterogeneity in the oncogene/suppressor gene profile among diffuse large cell lymphomas. Two cell lines and one tumor carried alterations in all three genes, one cell line carried alterations of c-MYC and p53, and one primary tumor and one cell line carried p53 mutations and the t(14;18). Single alterations of BCL-2 and p53 were also observed. Another cell line had no alterations in any of these genes. The heterogeneity indicates that varied mechanisms may be involved in the generation of diffuse large cell lymphomas",

    "Title": "Nonhereditary p53 mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia are associated with the relapse phase",
    "Abstract": "We have previously reported that greater than 60% of human leukemic T- cell lines possess mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. To determine whether T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patient samples possess p53 mutations, we screened peripheral blood-and bone marrow-derived leukemia samples, taken at diagnosis and at relapse, for p53 mutations. Exons 4 through 9 and selected intron regions of the p53 gene were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. p53 mutations were found in 0 of 15 T-ALL diagnosis samples, as compared with 10 of 36 (28%) T-ALL relapse samples. To determine whether p53 mutations play a role in the recurrence (relapse) of T-ALL, two special groups of T-ALL patients were studied: (1) a group of 8 relapse patients whose disease was refractory to chemotherapeutic treatment, and (2) a group of 6 'paired' T-ALL cell samples from patients for whom we possess both diagnosis and relapse samples. Three of 8 relapsed patients (37.5%) whose disease was refractory to the reinduction of remission by chemotherapy possessed missense mutations of the p53 gene. All 3 cases had mutations in exon 5. Among the paired samples, 3 of 6 patients harbored p53 mutations at disease recurrence, but possessed only wild- type p53 alleles at diagnosis. One case had mutation on exon 4, 1 case in exon 5, and 1 case in exon 8 with loss of heterozygosity. These data clearly indicate that recurrence of T-ALL is associated with missense mutations in p53. Our results indicate that (1) mutations of p53 do occur in T-ALL in vivo, and such mutations are associated with the relapse phase of the disease; and (2) p53 mutation is involved in the progression of T-ALL. This conclusion is supported by our observation that the introduction of T-ALL-derived mutant p53 expression constructs into T-ALL cell lines further increases their growth rate in culture, enhances cell cloning in methylcellulose, and increases tumor formation in nude mice",

    "Title": "Frequent p53 gene involvement in splenic B-cell leukemia/lymphomas of possible marginal zone origin",
    "Abstract": "A phenotypic and molecular evaluation was made of 15 patients with mature B-cell leukemia/lymphoma showing exclusive spleen and bone marrow involvement. According to French-American-British criteria, these cases could not be classified as classical B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia and its variant forms, splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, or leukemic phase non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; follicular or intermediate type). The immunophenotype pattern (high surface Ig and CD25 expression, and little or no reactivity with CD5, CD23, and CD11c) and cytomorphologic features of these neoplasms suggested an origin in the marginal zone of the spleen. Molecular analysis did not show any involvement of the dominantly acting oncogenes generally associated with lymphoid malignancies (c-myc, bcl-2, bcl-1, Ras), but mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene involving exons 5, 6, and 8 were found in 6 cases (6 of 15, 40%). In 4 cases, the p53 alterations consisted of a point mutation leading to amino acid substitution. In the remaining 2 cases, an insertion or deletion resulting in a frame-shift of the protein was observed. In all but 1 of the cases, the wild-type sequence at the mutation site was barely visible, implying the loss of the normal p53 allele in leukemic cells. All of the cases showed a clinical course compatible with that of low-grade NHL, regardless of the p53 loss/mutation. Overall, our data suggest the existence of a form of splenic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma of possible marginal zone origin in which p53 inactivation may play an important pathogenetic role",

    "Title": "Clinical significance of p53 mutations in relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia",
    "Abstract": "In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), p53 gene mutations were found in 12 of 51 patients in first relapse (24%). In a retrospective study, bone marrow samples at diagnosis were obtained from 9 of the 12 relapsed patients with p53 mutation; only one patient was found to harbor a p53 mutation at diagnosis. No further p53 mutations were identified in 18 unpaired diagnosis T-ALL samples. This is the first report of a p53 mutation in T-ALL at diagnosis. p53 mutations in relapsed T-ALL were clinically relevant. Patients with p53 mutations experience a shorter duration of survival than those patients without p53 mutations. Additionally, patients with p53 mutations were significantly less likely to have achieved a complete second remission from reinduction therapy than those patients without p53 mutations and experience a shorter duration of survival from relapse even when a second reinduction is obtained. Though primarily identified only at relapse, p53 mutations were also associated with a decreased duration of first remission and overall decrease in survival from diagnosis. Patients with p53 mutations had a 3.8-fold increase in risk of death than those patients without p53 mutations. These findings suggest that p53 mutation is associated with poor clinical outcome that is characterized by (1) a shortened duration of survival after first relapse; (2) a reduced response to reinduction therapy; (3) a shortened duration of first remission; and, hence, (4) an overall decreased duration of survival and increased risk of death",

    "Abstract": "We analyzed the prognostic value of p53 mutations for response to chemotherapy and survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Mutations were detected by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 4 to 10 of the P53 gene, and confirmed by direct sequencing. A p53 mutation was found in 16 of 107 (15%) AML, 20 of 182 (11%) MDS, and 9 of 81 (11%) CLL tested. In AML, three of nine (33%) mutated cases and 66 of 81 (81%) nonmutated cases treated with intensive chemotherapy achieved complete remission (CR) (P = .005) and none of five mutated cases and three of six nonmutated cases treated by low-dose Ara C achieved CR or partial remission (PR) (P = .06). Median actuarial survival was 2.5 months in mutated cases, and 15 months in nonmutated cases (P < 10(-5)). In the MDS patients who received chemotherapy (intensive chemotherapy or low-dose Ara C), 1 of 13 (8%) mutated cases and 23 of 38 (60%) nonmutated cases achieved CR or PR (P = .004), and median actuarial survival was 2.5 and 13.5 months, respectively (P < 10(-5)). In all MDS cases (treated and untreated), the survival difference between mutated cases and nonmutated cases was also highly significant. In CLL, 1 of 8 (12.5%) mutated cases treated by chemotherapy (chlorambucil and/or CHOP and/or fludarabine) responded, as compared with 29 of 36 (80%) nonmutated cases (P = .02). In all CLL cases, survival from p53 analysis was significantly shorter in mutated cases (median 7 months) than in nonmutated cases (median not reached) (P < 10(-5)). In 35 of the 45 mutated cases of AML, MDS, and CLL, cytogenetic analysis or SSCP and sequence findings showed loss of the nonmutated P53 allele. Our findings show that p53 mutations are a strong prognostic indicator of response to chemotherapy and survival in AML, MDS, and CLL. The usual association of p53 mutations to loss of the nonmutated P53 allele, in those disorders, ie, to absence of normal p53 in tumor cells, suggests that p53 mutations could induce drug resistance, at least in part, by interfering with normal apoptotic pathways in tumor cells",

    "Title": "Pattern of mutant p53 expression in human astrocytomas suggests the existence of alternate pathways of tumorigenesis",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. Clinical observations suggest that malignant astrocytomas may arise from well-differentiated, low-grade tumors that have undergone anaplastic progression or may develop de novo. Mutations that alter the function of the p53 gene product are thought to play a critical role in astrocytoma tumorigenesis. The authors studied the pattern of mutant p53 expression in astrocytomas to define its role in the formation of malignant tumors by these different pathways. METHODS. Tissues from 44 astrocytomas corresponding to Grades I-IV of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification were analyzed for the presence of mutations in exons 5, 7, and 8 of the p53 gene using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequence analysis of DNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. Immunostaining for mutant p53 proteins was performed on tissues fixed in formaldehyde solution and embedded in paraffin; the tissues were from these 44 astrocytomas and another 103 astrocytomas obtained from archival material. RESULTS. Tumors with mutant p53 genes were reliably identified by immunostaining for mutant p53 proteins. A higher percentage of astrocytomas of histologic Grades II-IV stained positively for p53 than were identified by mutational analysis. The average ages of patients with Grade III/IV astrocytomas with prominent (> 10%) p53 staining and those with sparse (< 10%) or no p53 staining were 44.5, 64.3, and 67.9 years, respectively (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. The pattern of mutant p53 expression is consistent with a role in driving the progression of low- grade astrocytomas to more malignant tumors. These results provide a genetic basis for the clinical observation that malignant astrocytomas resulting from anaplastic progression occur in a younger patient population than do malignant astrocytomas arising de novo",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations and steroid receptor status in breast cancer. Clinicopathologic correlations and prognostic assessment",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. There is increasing evidence linking development and progression of cancer to an accumulation of mutations at the genomic level. The most frequently mutated gene known to date in sporadic breast cancer appears to be the tumor suppressor gene p53. This study was designed to determine the frequency of p53 gene mutations in primary breast cancer, to correlate the presence of p53 mutations with established clinicopathologic parameters, including the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status, and to assess the prognostic significance of p53 mutations regarding patient survival. METHODS. We examined the p53 gene in genomic DNA samples from 192 primary breast cancers. Using denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis, the authors analyzed exons 5-9 in all tumors for mutations and performed DNA sequencing in 20 tumors to identify the exact nature of the p53 mutations. RESULTS. p53 gene alterations were identified in 43 of the 192 tumors (22%), the majority localized in exons 5 and 6. DNA sequencing showed mostly missense mutations resulting from G or C substitutions. p53 mutations were found more often in tumors of younger women (P = 0.002), Afro-American women (P = 0.05), and in tumors lacking ER (P = 0.03), PR (P = 0.04), or both (P = 0.06). There were no significant correlations with family history, tumor size, histologic grade or type, nodal status, or disease stage. The overall survival rates showed no significant difference between patients with mutant and wild-type p53 tumors. The same was true when the comparison was limited to node-negative patients or patients with ER-positive or ER-negative tumors. Finally, there was no significant difference in survival between patients with tumors harboring mutations in exons 5 and 6 versus exons 7-9. CONCLUSIONS. The results of this and other studies demonstrate a consistent relationship between ER-positive tumors and wild-type p53 on one hand and ER-negative cancers and p53 mutations on the other. Our data do not support a significant prognostic role for p53 mutations in predicting survival",

    "Title": "Low frequency of the p53 gene mutations in neuroblastoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. The p53 gene frequently is affected by point mutations, rearrangements, or deletions that contribute to the genesis or progression of a wide variety of human adult solid tumors; however, to the authors' knowledge, this gene alteration has not been analyzed in neuroblastoma. METHODS. Genomic DNA samples from 20 children with neuroblastoma, including 16 patients with advanced disease, were screened for the presence of mutations in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene, where over 90% of mutations have been reported to be located in human cancer. The screening technique employed polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS. Heterozygous mutations were detected in 2 of the 20 cases. A silent mutation (T to G transversion) at codon 172 and a missense mutation (G to T transversion) at codon 259 were found in patients with Stage II and Stage IV disease, respectively. Thus, p53 mutations were found to occur in neuroblastoma, but at a low frequency (2 of 20). CONCLUSIONS. Our data suggest that in a minority of neuroblastomas, p53 gene mutations may play a contributing role in tumorigenesis, but other genes presumably play a major role in this tumor",

One sample had P53 staining by immunohistochemistry, one sample was positive for a p53 mutation by SSCP, and one sample was positive by both techniques. Mutations in the two samples that were positive by SSCP were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. In a separate study of ten lymph nodes that contained prostate cancer metastases, one had detectable P53 protein by immunohistochemical staining.

The 16 mutations detected differed from those of other populations. In particular, the black women had an excess of A:T-->G:C transitions compared with rural white US midwest women. While the causes of the different pattern of acquired mutation remain to be determined, this molecular epidemiological approach detects the consequences of mutagenic processes in specific populations.

    "Title": "Sunburn and p53 in the onset of skin cancer",
    "Abstract": "Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC) can progress by stages: sun- damaged epidermis, with individual disordered keratinocytes; actinic keratosis (AK), spontaneously regressing keratinized patches having aberrant cell differentiation and proliferation; carcinoma in situ; SCC and metastasis. To understand how sunlight acts as a carcinogen, we determined the stage at which sunlight mutates the p53 tumour- suppressor gene and identified a function for p53 in skin. The p53 mutations induced by ultraviolet radiation and found in > 90% of human SCCs were present in AKs. Inactivating p53 in mouse skin reduced the appearance of sunburn cells, apoptotic keratinocytes generated by overexposure to ultraviolet. Skin thus appears to possess a p53- dependent 'guardian-of-the-tissue' response to DNA damage which aborts precancerous cells. If this response is reduced in a single cell by a prior p53 mutation, sunburn can select for clonal expansion of the p53- mutated cell into the AK. Sunlight can act twice: as tumour initiator and tumour promoter",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are among the most common genetic alterations found in many different human malignancies, including those of the colon, lung, and breast. Alterations in wild- type p53 lead to loss of the suppressor function and thus contribute to tumorigenesis. The potential role of p53 mutations in a sampling of B- cell lymphomas, the majority of which were associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), was investigated. Twenty-six biopsy specimens from immunocompromised patients, including allograft recipients and patients with AIDS, Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome, and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 infection, in comparison with three Burkitt lymphomas and four Burkitt lymphoma cell lines were analyzed. Mutation in p53 was detected in all four Burkitt lymphoma cell lines as well as the three Burkitt lymphoma biopsy specimens. In patients with AIDS, 5 of 10 lymphomas were EBV positive, and 1 had a mutation in p53. Mutation in p53 was not detected in 14 EBV-positive lymphomas which arose in transplant recipients. These data indicate that with the exception of Burkitt lymphomas, p53 mutations are not involved in the majority EBV-positive B-cell lymphomas which develop in immunocompromised patients",

    "Abstract": "Using the polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and direct nucleotide sequence determination, the p53 gene was analyzed in six fresh leukemia samples from which cell lines with p53 mutations were established. Mutations of the p53 gene which were identical to those in the cell lines were observed in three of the fresh samples. In the other three samples, p53 gene mutations were not detected by the conventional PCR- SSCP method. However, when analyzed using allele-specific gene amplification, less than 10% of the leukemic cell population of the three samples, which were below the detection threshold of PCR-SSCP, were shown to have p53 gene mutations. Two samples taken at the initial presentation of two patients, whose relapse samples were shown to contain p53 mutant clones, were also available for analysis. A small population of clonal cells, comprising less than 1% of the population, was shown to have p53 gene mutations in both of these initial samples. These observations provide a potential biologic basis for the frequent findings of p53 mutations in leukemia cell lines and also suggest a potential role for p53 mutations in the clonal overgrowth of cells responsible for relapse of the disease",

In the present study, the loss of Rb1 protein expression, and the presence of Rb1 gene rearrangements as well as the presence of p53 somatic mutations (exons 5 through 9) were investigated in a panel of plasma cell dyscrasias, including 15 monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS), 63 multiple myelomas (MM), and 18 plasma cell leukemias (PCL). In the same panel of cases, we established the frequency of ras oncogene mutations, the main genetic lesion associated with MM. We report that loss of Rb1 protein and p53 mutations are detectable in 34.7 and 9.8% of MM and PCL primary cases; no lesion was found in MGUS. In advanced stage MM, and PCL cases, Rb1 and p53 inactivation, as well as ras mutations were detected. Our findings show that Rb1 and p53 inactivation are associated with aggressive plasma cell dyscrasias, suggesting a role for these lesions in tumor progression rather than initiation",

Using Southern blot analysis and complementarity determining region III polymerase chain reaction (CDRIII PCR), 18 cases of B-lineage ALL and 11 cases of T-ALL were studied. Of 20 specimens from 18 B-lineage ALLs, two of four with p53 mutation and two of 16 without mutation had an unrearranged Ig and TCR genotype (p = 0.16; Fisher's exact test). Of 11 cases of T-ALL, the one case with p53 mutation had a rearranged TCR and Ig genotype and a case without mutation was unrearranged. The study indicates that p53 mutation is an infrequent feature of ALL found, nonetheless, in every genotypic subset. The p53 mutations in cases that do not further rearrange may support p53 involvement in lymphoid differentiation, but the heterogeneity in differentiation stages in cases both with and without p53 mutations suggests that regulation of early lymphoid maturation is multifactorial",

We looked for circulating p53 antibodies in 83 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), by an ELISA technique. Detection of p53 mutations was made by single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 4 to 10 of the P53 gene and confirmed by direct sequencing. Circulating antibodies to p53 were seen in three of the 83 (3.5%) patients analyzed, and a p53 point mutation was found in ten cases. Two of the three patients with p53 antibodies had a p53 mutation, but the remaining case had no detectable mutation. The other eight mutated cases had no detectable p53 antibodies. Our findings show that serological analysis of p53 antibodies is rarely positive in MDS and AML. This could be due to the relatively low incidence of p53 mutations seen in those disorders, but also to the immune depression to which they are often associated",

    "Title": "Detection of p53 mutations in hematological malignancies: comparison between immunocytochemistry and DNA analysis",
    "Abstract": "The wild type p53 protein has a short half-life and cannot be detected by immunohistochemistry on tissue sections. Mutated p53, on the other hand, has a prolonged half-life and becomes detectable by this method, so that its detection by immunohistochemistry in solid tumors is almost synonymous with mutation. We assessed the value of immunocytochemical analysis of p53 protein on blood or bone marrow slides in the detection of p53 mutation in hematological malignancies, by comparison with single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 4 to 10 of the P53 gene. One hundred and twenty eight patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were studied by both methods. Immunocytochemistry showed detectable levels of intracellular p53 in 19 cases (including 2/19 AML, 2/21 ALL, 11/48 MDS, 4/40 CLL). Staining by p53 antibodies was restricted to the nucleus of blasts in AML, ALL, and MDS, and of lymphocytes in CLL. In 16 of the 19 cases, SSCP analysis, followed by direct sequencing, showed a p53 missense mutation in exons 4 to 8 of the gene. In the remaining three cases, where the number of cells stained by p53 antibodies was small, no p53 mutation could be detected. On the other hand, SSCP and sequence analysis identified a p53 mutation in two patients who had negative immunocytochemical findings. Both cases had a nonsense mutation, presumably leading to reduced levels of truncated p53. Thus, overall, immunocytochemistry and SSCP gave concordant results in 123 of the 128 (96%) patients analyzed. Our findings show that immunocytochemistry on blood and bone marrow smears is a sensitive method of p53 mutation detection in hematological malignancies, except in the rare patients with chain-terminating mutations. Positive immunocytochemistry is found in some patients with normal SSCP findings, and could correspond to overexpression of a non-mutated p53, but also to p53 mutation in a minor proportion of the malignant cells, undetectable by SSCP",

    "Abstract": "To examine the significance of mutation of the p53 tumour suppressor gene in the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma in a high- prevalence area for hepatitis B viral infection but a low-exposure area for aflatoxin B1, the spectrum of p53 gene mutations was examined in 21 tumour samples from Hong Kong Chinese patients, all of whom were HBsAg positive. DNA sequencing covering exons 5 to 9 of the p53 gene and Hae III restriction enzyme digestion for preliminary assessment of mutation at codon 249 were performed. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies was done on both tumour and nontumour liver tissues. Six tumours (28.6%) showed a p53 mutation and all were point mutations. Of the six point mutations, two (9.5%) were at codon 249 and both were G to T transversions (AGG-->ATG and AGG-->AGT transversions). The remaining point mutations were transversions scattered at codon 172 (exon 5), 214 (exon 6), 273 (exon 8) and 330 (exon 9). Mutated p53 protein was detected in five of these six cases with demonstrable point mutations by DNA sequencing, in contrast to none detected in all of the 15 cases without demonstrable point mutations. The presence of p53 mutations, including those at codon 249, did not show a significant association with tumour size, sex, age, tumour invasiveness in terms of liver invasion, microsatellites and venous permeation, cirrhosis and encapsulation, but tumours with low cellular differentiation tended to have a higher incidence (71%) of point mutations than those with high cellular differentiation (8%). In conclusion, both the overall p53 mutation rate and that a codon 249 in HCC in Hong Kong Chinese are lower than those reported in tumours from China and sub-Saharan Africa. The low mutation rate at codon 249 is compatible with a low aflatoxin exposure. A special type of p53 mutation has not been found to be associated with hepatitis B viral infection. Mutations of p53 gene tends to occur in tumours with low cellular differentiation, suggesting a late occurrence in the event of tumour progression",

    "Title": "Carcinoma of the vulva: HPV and p53 mutations",
    "Abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva may have more than one etiology, with only some tumors associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). Cells infected with HPV produce a viral protein (E6) which binds to and causes rapid degradation of p53, possibly contributing to cellular transformation. In several human malignancies, point mutations of p53 alter activity of the p53 protein contributing to cellular transformation. We tested, for the first time, the possibility that HPV-negative tumors of the vulva may have a high incidence of inactivating mutations of p53; while HPV-containing vulvar tumors rarely would have p53 mutations. Twenty-one tumors of the vulva were evaluated for the presence of HPV sequences by amplication with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blotting. These were evaluated for p53 mutations by single strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing of PCR products. HPV DNA sequences were found in 12 of 21 (57%) cancers of the vulva; only one of these 12 (8%) HPV-positive samples had a missense mutation of p53. In contrast, four of nine (44%) HPV-negative vulvar tumors had point mutations of p53. The p53 mutations were found in only metastatic lesion and the only recurrent tumor samples suggesting that the acquisition of p53 mutations may be associated with neoplastic progression. In conclusion, alterations in p53 activity appear to be important in the development of carcinoma of the vulva",

Because p53 mutations have in a number of human cancer types, been related to a negative outcome of the disease and the importance of pre-symptomatic diagnosis in cancer-prone families, screening for p53 mutations is becoming more and more widely used. In order to avoid sequencing of the complete coding sequence, several pre-screening methods have been developed and applied to the p53 gene. Among them, Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) appear to be highly sensitive. In this work, we used 52 different p53 variants to compare the two methods. In our conditions, DGGE is more sensitive than SSCP since 100% of the variants were detected. SSCP detected 90% of the variants, but efficiency of the method can still be improved by additional optimization experiments",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in HPV-negative cervical carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been strongly linked to the development of cervical carcinoma. Two viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, produced by HPV, have been shown to immortalize primary human genital epithelial cells by interacting with the protein products of cellular tumor suppressor genes p53 and Rb, respectively. E6 binds to the cellular p53 protein promoting p53 degradation and inactivity. This mechanism has been suggested to contribute to the oncogenesis of HPV- positive anogenital cancers. In HPV-negative cervical carcinoma, p53 mutation is thought to be the possible mechanism of oncogenesis. We have studied 257 cervical carcinoma specimens for HPV infection by Southern blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of 257 samples, 39 were HPV-negative. We have further studied 21 HPV-negative specimens for p53 mutations utilizing PCR amplification of genomic DNA followed by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. We found only two missense point mutations of p53 gene. In summary, although inactivation of p53 mediated either by E6 or by mutations may be an important key step in the development of cervical carcinoma, our study suggests that other mechanisms may also be involved in development of cervical cancer",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 tumour suppressor gene have been recently described in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) from high risk areas such as China and South Africa. Our study was designed to assess the importance of p53 aberrations in HCCs from Europe, where the major risk factors in hepatocarcinogenesis, aflatoxin exposure and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, do not play a dominant role. We investigated 22 HCCs and, as controls, their corresponding tumour-free liver tissues, seven livers with primary biliary cirrhosis and four morphologically normal livers. p53 overexpression, which is usually associated with point mutations of the p53 gene, was detected in 10 of the 22 HCCs by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. p53 expression was restricted to the nucleus in the positive cells, while all cells in the control tissues were negative. There was no obvious etiological preference in the p53 positive tumours. Particularly, underlying chronic HBV infection did not appear to be associated with an increased rate of p53 overexpression in European HCCs. SSCP and sequence analysis of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene revealed point mutations in six out of eight tumours with increased steady state levels of p53. In conclusion, our study demonstrates increased p53 levels due to point mutations in a significant proportion of European HCCs. The codon 249 mutation, which was detected in one of the cases, is not predominant in these tumours",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations in breast cancers in midwestern US women: null as well as missense-type mutations are associated with poor prognosis",
    "Abstract": "We determined the pattern of mutations in exons 2-11 and adjacent intronic regions in breast cancers from Midwestern US white women. Twenty-one mutations were detected in 53 tumors (39.6%). Comparisons of the pattern of mutations within exons 5-9 showed that the frequency of missense mutations (44%) was lower in breast cancers of US Midwestern women than in most tumor types including breast cancers in other populations. Compared to breast cancers reported in a Scottish population, US women had a high frequency of G:C-->T:A transversions (P = 0.046). These findings suggest that environmental or endogenous factors contribute to p53 mutagenesis in mammary tissue to different extents among different populations. With a median follow-up of 19 months, the presence of a mutation was associated with shorter time to disease recurrence (P = 0.05) and shorter survival (P = 0.003). Putative dominant negative missense-type mutations (missense and in- frame microdeletions; P = 0.001) and null mutations (hemizygous nonsense and frameshift mutations; P = 0.007) were equally ominous. Thus, tumors with missense p53 mutations resulting in over-expression of a dysfunctional but otherwise intact protein have a clinical outcome similar to tumors with null mutations resulting in a truncated or garbled protein",

    "Title": "A study of stabilisation of p53 protein versus point mutation in colorectal carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Abnormalities of the p53 tumour suppressor gene occur in many types of cancer including approximately 60% of colorectal carcinomas. This study investigates in 47 colorectal carcinomas the relationship between stabilised p53 protein detected by immunocytochemistry (ICC), and p53 mutation. 27 cases stained positively with the antibody PAb1801. Sequencing of exons 5-8 revealed 19 mutations in 18 of these cases (one tumour contained two different mutations). A rapid, non-radioactive method was developed to screen for mutations in this region of the gene involving Single Strand Conformational Polymorphism analysis (SSCP) and a MspI restriction digestion. This screen detected 17/19 (89%) of the sequenced mutations, and a further four mutations in 20 PAb1801 negative cases that were confirmed by sequencing. Reproducibility of ICC in detecting stabilised protein was assessed by restaining the 47 cases with the antibody DO7 after pre-treatment to optimise detection. Fewer cases were negative with DO7 although overall concordance with PAb1801 was good. A substantial proportion of carcinomas with stabilised p53 as detected by ICC do not contain mutations in exons 5- 8, whilst some mutations (the majority in exon 6) are not associated with stabilisation",

    "Abstract": "We analysed 31 non-glioblastoma astrocytomas for alterations in p53 protein expression and for mutations in the p53 gene. Immunohistochemistry detected p53 protein accumulation in 71% (five of seven) of juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I), 63% (five of eight) of astrocytomas (WHO grade II), and 63% (10 of 16) of anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO grade III). The single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay of exons 2-11 of the p53 gene and direct DNA sequencing identified p53 mutations in 14% (one of seven) of grade I, 25% (two of eight) of grade II, and 19% (three of 16) of grade III astrocytomas. This is the first report of a p53 mutation in grade I juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas. Immunohistochemistry and SSCP analyses gave concordant results in 55% (17 of the 31) of the tumors. A total of 14 tumors, 60-80% within each grade, showed p53 protein accumulation in the absence of detectable mutations of the p53 gene. No mdm-2 gene amplification was found in these tumors. The similar frequency of p53 alterations in tumors of grades I-III suggests that the p53 gene plays a significant role early in the formation of astrocytomas rather than late in tumor progression to higher grade. The data suggest that mechanisms other than p53 gene inactivation by mutation or mdm-2 complex formation result in the accumulation of P53 protein in > 70% of non-glioblastoma astrocytomas",

    "Abstract": "To determine if the MCC, DCC or p53 gene is associated with susceptibility to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), these genes in normal cells from 12 HNPCC patients were analysed by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. No changes which may alter the amino acid sequences of these genes were detected, suggesting that these genes are not associated with the susceptibility to HNPCC. Only one of nine HNPCC cancers showed mutations in the MCC and p53 genes on the same analysis. Loss of heterozygosity in chromosomes 5q, 17p, 18q and 22 was detected in four of the nine cancers, all of them being positive as to metastasis to lymph nodes. Abnormalities of the (CA)n repeat were found in six cancers, including all four without metastasis. These data indicate that tumor suppressor genes in chromosomes 5q, 17p, 18q and 22 are associated with the late stage of colorectal tumorigenesis in HNPCC, whereas the (CA)n repeat abnormalities are an early event of tumorigenesis and more essential to HNPCC",

    "Title": "Occurrence of human papillomavirus and p53 gene mutations in Kaposi's sarcoma",
    "Abstract": "Epidemiological evidence indicates that a sexually transmitted agent might be involved in the etiopathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). The prevalence of human papillomaviruses (HPV) in KS has been the focus of several investigations that have reported conflicting data. In addition, mutations of the p53 gene, which are the most frequent genetic changes found in human tumors, are absent in HPV-positive cervical carcinomas leading to the hypothesis that the function of p53 in HPV-positive tumors is inactivated through binding to the E6 viral gene product. Thus, the present study was designed to investigate the presence of HPV and p53 gene mutations in 17 formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded KS [7 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-KS (AIDS-KS) and 10 classic KS] specimens. HPV 6 DNA was detected in an AIDS-KS specimen, and HPV 16 DNA was found in 3 classic KS specimens. Heterozygous mutations of the p53 gene were detected in five (24%) KS samples. No p53 mutations were detected in HPV-positive KS. The p53 mutations were mainly transversions (four of five). These data indicate that HPV may contribute to the pathogenesis of some cases of KS and that p53 alteration may represent a key event in the progression of the malignancy",

    "Abstract": "Mutations at the p53 tumor suppressor gene locus are a frequent genetic alteration associated with human ovarian carcinoma. Little information exists regarding whether mutational events occur other than point mutations and large deletions, causing loss of heterozygosity. Small intragenic deletions and insertions in the p53 gene have been observed in various human neoplasias. We developed a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) screening assay to amplify the complete p53 coding region from genomic DNA in a single step. Deletions and/or insertions were found in six out of 11 newly established ovarian carcinoma cell lines. MPCR detected deletions as small as 2 bp, as confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. Most of the observed alterations (6/7) were homozygous or hemizygous. Structural aberrations of the p53 gene possibly leading to loss of p53 cell cycle control may be a consequence of a slipped-mispairing mechanism in rapid DNA replication during repetitious ovulation and wound repair of ovarian epithelial cells. MPCR may be a valuable tool for screening for possible p53 deletion and insertion mutations not only in ovarian cancer but also in other malignancies",

    "Abstract": "To investigate genetic features in small and flat colorectal carcinomas that arise de novo, we searched for genetic alterations in six sporadic tumors by examining their APC, K-ras, and p53 genes. Two of the six tumors carried detectable mutations within the mutation cluster region (MCR) of the APC gene; both mutations were predicted to cause truncation of the gene product. Four tumors carried mutations of the p53 gene; three were missense mutations in exon 5, and the other was a 3-bp deletion in exon 6. However, neither codon 12 nor codon 13 of K- ras contained detectable mutation in any tumors. Hence, as 'adenoma- carcinoma sequence' model of development of colorectal carcinoma, inactivation of the APC and p53 genes appear to be involved in development of the de novo type of colorectal carcinoma even though the adenoma stage is not observed",

When histopathology reports were available, p53 mutations were present in eight of eleven anaplastic WTs, a tumour subtype associated with poor prognosis. Amplification of MDM2, a gene whose product binds and sequesters p53, was excluded. Our results indicate that p53 alterations provide a molecular marker for anaplastic WTs",

    "Abstract": "Point mutations and deletions in the p53 tumor suppressor gene occur frequently in advanced stage bladder tumors. To extend these observations to an in vitro model of bladder tumorigenicity, we have evaluated the presence of p53 mutations in a panel of bladder carcinoma cell lines. p53 alleles were cloned using the reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction method, and exons 2-11 were sequenced. Of 11 cell lines examined, 5 cell lines had missense point mutations, and each overexpressed p53 protein on western blot analysis. Except for the HT-1197 cell line, these point mutations occurred in evolutionarily conserved domains, which are characteristic hot spots for mutations. HT- 1197 encodes an unusual C-terminal point mutation in codon 365, within the basic motif tetramerization domain, suggesting a linkage between induction of a mutant p53 conformation and alterations in protein oligomerization. Six of 11 cell lines had wild-type levels of p53 expression, with 4 producing p53 proteins having either internal deletions or truncations, and 2 producing wild-type p53. Presence of wild-type p53 was found only in cell lines derived from either a low- grade, papillary tumor (RT4) or fetal bladder (FHs 738Bl). The T24 cell line was found to contain a novel p53 mutant having an in-frame deletion of tyrosine 126. This p53 mutant does not bind SV40 large T antigen, yet is expressed at low levels, comparable to cell lines containing wild-type p53 alleles. Our findings characterize p53 mutations in a panel of bladder carcinoma cell lines, and provide a model for testing the role of wild-type or mutant p53 cDNA to suppress or induce tumorigenic properties",

No germline mutations were found, suggesting that the genetic basis of familial glioma is distinct from that of gliomas occurring in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and that inherited mutations of the catalytic domain of neurofibromin do not predispose affected glioma families to these tumors",

    "Abstract": "With the goal of identifying a potential intermediate biomarker in the multistep process of head and neck cancer development, we conducted immunohistochemical analyses for p53 expression in 33 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas whose tissue sections contained adjacent normal epithelium, hyperplastic, and/or dysplastic lesions. Fifteen of 33 (45%) squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck expressed p53, but none of four normal control patients (cancer-free nonsmokers) expressed detectable p53 in oral mucosa specimens. To determine when p53 expression is initiated during head and neck tumorigenesis, we examined the normal and premalignant lesions adjacent to the tumors. Five of 24 (21%) samples of normal epithelium adjacent to tumors, 7 of 24 (29%) samples of hyperplasia, and 9 of 20 (45%) samples of dysplasia expressed p53. Quantitative image analysis demonstrated not only a gradual increase in the amount of p53 expression as tissue abnormalities progressed but also a topological change in expression. Whereas p53 expression, when present, was limited to the basal layer in normal epithelium adjacent to tumor, the expression of p53 expanded into the parabasal and superficial layers in hyperplasia and dysplasia. We conclude that p53 expression can be altered in very early phases of head and neck tumorigenesis. Thus, it may be an excellent candidate for risk assessment and may serve as an intermediate biomarker in chemoprevention trials",

    "Abstract": "Aflatoxin B1 has been suggested as a causative agent for a G to T mutation at codon 249 in the p53 gene in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) from southern Africa and Qidong in China. The objective of the present work was to test the hypothesis that exposure to aflatoxin B1 either alone or coincident with other environmental carcinogens might be associated with allelic losses occurring during development of human hepatocarcinogenesis in China. The HCCs were obtained from two different areas in China: Qidong, where exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and aflatoxin B1 is high; and Beijing, where exposure to HBV is high but that of aflatoxin B1 is low. We analyzed the tumors for mutations in the p53 gene and loss of heterozygosity for the p53, Rb, and APC genes and at marker loci on chromosomes 4, 13, and 16. Frequencies of mutation, loss, and aberration (mutation and loss) of the p53 gene in 25 HCCs from Qidong were 60, 58, and 80%, respectively. The frequencies in 9 HCCs from Beijing were 56, 57, and 78%. However, the frequency of a G to T transversion at codon 249 in HCCs from Qidong and Beijing were 52 and 0%, respectively. These data indicate that mutation and/or loss of heterozygosity in the p53 gene, independent of the 249 mutation, play a critical role in the development of hepatitis B virus-associated HCCs in China. Loss of the Rb and APC genes was observed in 44 and 7% of HCCs from Qidong, respectively. Allelic losses on chromosome 4 and especially on chromosome 16 were frequent in HCCs from Qidong but were not observed in HCCs from Beijing, while loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 13 occurred at similar frequency in both Qidong and Beijing. These results show a distinct difference in the pattern of allelic losses between HCCs in Qidong and Beijing and suggest that aflatoxin B1 and/or other environmental carcinogens may contribute to this difference",

    "Title": "p53 gene abnormalities are closely related to hepatoviral infections and occur at a late stage of hepatocarcinogenesis",
    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accumulates a mutation of the p53 gene with a common substitution of nucleotide in a particular site. It is hypothesized that infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or exposure to aflatoxins could induce it. In Japan, the concentration of aflatoxins in the environment is low; however, infection of HBV and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) is frequently seen in patients with HCC. The purpose of our studies was to determine whether these hepatoviral factors influence p53 alterations. In our results, p53 abnormalities, which were composed of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and/or point mutation, were shown in 39% of patients. We postulated that they occurred at late stages in tumor growth based on the following two results. LOH analysis on p53 showed that most of the tumor nodule consisted of two phenotypes, LOH and non-LOH cancer cells. The p53 abnormalities correlated with the grade of cancer cell atypia which advanced with tumor growth. HBV and HCV infections were identified by polymerase chain reaction using DNA extracted from cancerous and noncancerous regions of the liver. By these methods, the patients who had been infected with either HBV or HCV showed an incidence of p53 abnormalities (45%) higher than those infected by neither (13%). However, the detection rate of these viruses was lower in the HCC region (33%) than that in the noncancerous region (56%) in cases with mutated p53. The low rate of HCV detection (22%) in the HCC region with altered p53 was attributable to these different viral detection rates. There was a difference in pattern of p53 mutational changes in patients depending upon whether they were infected by HBV or by HCV. Two of three HBV-infected patients had a transversional change of nucleotide at the G:C site to T:A. However, in cases with HCV, four of eight patients had a transitional change of nucleotide of p53. These results showed that HBV and HCV infections affect carcinogenic pathways causing p53 abnormalities independently",

Unlike squamous carcinoma of the skin, BCC is generally indolent, noninvasive, and rarely metastatic. To study the involvement of tumor suppressor genes in these neoplasms, we analyzed 36 BCCs for p53 mutations and a subset of these tumors for loss of chromosomes 17p and 9q. Sixty-nine % of sporadic BCCs had lost a 9q allele, with the common area of loss surrounding the putative gene for nevoid BCC or Gorlin's syndrome. Forty-four % (16 of 36) of BCCs had a mutated p53 allele, usually opposite pyrimidine tracts, which is consistent with UV-induced mutations. Surprisingly, only one tumor had lost a 17p allele, and in all BCCs only one p53 allele was inactivated. This is in direct contrast to other epithelial tumors, which usually progress by the inactivation of both p53 alleles",

    "Title": "Analysis of the p53 gene and its expression in human glioblastoma cells",
    "Abstract": "Chromosome 17p has been shown to be an early and frequent target for loss of heterozygosity through mitotic recombination in astrocytomas. These losses are frequently accompanied by point mutations in the p53 gene of the remaining allele, resulting in loss of wild type p53 function. However, a fraction of astrocytomas retain constitutional heterozygosity and do not have p53 mutations; some of these lose wild type p53 activity through binding to the protein product of amplified mdm2 genes. To test whether loss of wild type p53 biological function is a necessary step in astrocytoma progression we analyzed p53 expression and biological function in 13 glioma cell lines. All the cell lines expressed a 2.8-kilobase p53 transcript and showed various amounts of p53 protein by immunoprecipitation, except for cell line LN- Z308 which had only a small truncated p53 mRNA and no protein expression. To test whether the p53 expressed in these cell lines was functionally wild type or mutant we transfected them with a plasmid construct harboring a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene under the control of transcriptional elements that are induced by wild type but not mutant p53. Four lines were shown to retain wild type p53 function. Sequencing of the p53 gene in two of these cell lines confirmed the wild type genotype. These results show that inactivation of the p53 gene is not an obligatory step in glioblastoma genesis. This suggests either that two pathways (p53 inactivation dependent or independent) may lead to a tumor group classified histologically as glioblastoma or that in some cases p53 mutations are bypassed due to the presence of mutations in downstream effector genes",

Wilms' tumor, a common solid tumor of childhood, can be associated with mutations of the WT1 gene. Alterations of the p53 gene have been shown to modulate the ability of WT1 to transactivate its targets. Although positive p53 immunostaining has been demonstrated in Wilms' tumors, the correlation to p53 gene mutations is not clear. We examined Wilms' tumor samples for p53 mutations utilizing polymerase chain reaction- single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and single-strand DNA sequencing. Mutations in the coding region of the p53 gene were demonstrated in 2 of 21 (9.5%) Wilms' tumors. Each mutation yielded a substitution of amino acid residues. One mutation was located in exon 6 and the other in exon 7. Both mutations were found in tumors from patients with advanced stage disease. Focal anaplasia was demonstrated in one of these tumors. Our data suggest that although p53 mutations occur infrequently in Wilms' tumor, they may be associated with advanced disease",

    "Abstract": "Glial tumors of all grades and histological types from 72 adults and 48 children were analyzed for mutations of the TP53 gene, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for 17p, and accumulation of TP53 protein to determine whether the incidence and type of TP53 alterations differ among tumors of different histological type and between tumors from adults and children. These tumors were also evaluated for LOH for chromosome 10 and for amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor, C-MYC, N-MYC, GLI, platelet-derived growth factor receptor- alpha, and murine double minute 2 genes to determine the patterns of molecular alterations involved in the progression of these neoplasms. Seventeen of the 120 tumors contained mutations of the TP53 gene. One of the tumors with TP53 gene mutation was from one of the 48 patients less than 18 years of age. Twelve of the 17 tumors with mutations occurred among the 27 patients in the 18-45-year age group, while 4 tumors with mutations were among the 45 patients more than 45 years old. There was also an increased incidence of TP53 mutation in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma histology. However, no significant association between presence of TP53 mutation and patient survival was observed. These studies demonstrate that TP53 gene mutations are a common mechanism for glial cell neoplasms in the 18-45-year age group but are unrelated to progression and advanced histological grade. LOH for chromosome 10 and gene amplification, however, occurring in 82 and 40%, respectively, of glioblastoma multiforme, whether seen alone or along with TP53 gene alterations, are related to advanced histological grade of the tumor. In childhood gliomas, in contrast, TP53 gene alterations, LOH for 17p and 10q, and gene amplification are uncommon in tumors of all grades, suggesting that presently unknown mechanisms are responsible for the genesis and progression of these tumors",

    "Title": "K-ras and p53 gene mutations in pancreatic cancer: ductal and nonductal tumors progress through different genetic lesions",
    "Abstract": "We studied K-ras and p53 gene mutations in a panel of 57 primary pancreatic cancers including ductal and nonductal tumors. DNAs were obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material. Target sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. Both K-ras and p53 genes were frequently mutated in ductal cancers (25 of 35, 71.4%; 18 of 35, 51.4%, respectively). K-ras mutations were confined to the second position of codon 12 where base transitions and transversions were equally observed. p53 changes were mainly missense mutations. Transitions and transversions were found equally with a prevalence of G:C-->A:T changes among transitions. No gene alterations were present in the 6 exocrine nonductal tumors and (with one exception) in the 12 endocrine tumors analyzed. Our results indicate that mutated K-ras and p53 genes can cooperate in the establishment of ductal pancreatic cancers, whereas other genetic events have to be present in nonductal tumors. Moreover, K-ras alterations may represent an early event in ductal tumorigenesis, as suggested both by the high gene mutation frequency and by the presence of mutations in low-grade tumors. On the contrary, p53 gene changes seem to represent an event required for the malignancy progression of ductal tumors from lower to higher grades",

    "Title": "Loss of heterozygosity and p53 gene mutations in breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "Immunopositivity for the p53 tumor suppressor gene product was evaluated in 133 breast cancers and compared to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at various chromosomal loci. The validity of p53 immunopositivity as an indicator for p53 mutations was verified using two molecular assays of p53 mutations: single stranded conformational polymorphism (32 cases) and/or direct sequencing (14 cases). Immunopositivity was highly specific for mutations, since all of 15 strongly immunopositive tumors (> 10% of the cells are positive) and seven of nine cases with borderline immunopositivity had mutations by molecular analysis but were somewhat lower in sensitivity, p53 mutations being also detected in three of 23 (13%) immunonegative cases. LOH was measured at loci on the following chromosomes (1p,q; 2p; 3p; 7q; 11p,q; 13q; 16q; 17p; 18p,q; and 22q) by Southern blotting, polymerase chain reaction amplification of restriction fragment length polymorphisms, or repetitive cytidine and adenine stretches (CA repeats). There was no association between p53 mutations and one measure of genomic instability, namely, high incidence of overall LOH. In contrast, p53 mutations strongly associated with LOH at two specific loci, 3p24-26 (P < 0.001) and 7q31 (P < 0.05). There was no association between p53 mutations and LOH at 17p (site of the p53 gene), suggesting that breast cancers often have only one defective allele of the p53 gene",

    "Abstract": "The Johns Hopkins Lung Project developed an archive of sputum specimens during a randomized trial of lung cancer screening (1974-1982).  We identified 15 patients from that trial who later developed adenocarcinoma of the lung.  The primary lung carcinomas from 10 of these 15 patients contained either a ras or a p53 gene mutation.  Using a polymerase chain reaction-based assay,stored sputum samples obtained prior to clinical diagnosis were examined for the presence of these same oncogene mutations.  In 8 of 10 patients, the identical mutation identified in the primary tumor was also detected in at least one sputum sample.  The earliest detection of a clonal population of cancer cells in sputum was in a sample obtained more than 1 year prior to clinical diagnosis.  These results provide the basis of a novel approach for detection of lung cancer based on the evolving molecular genetics of this disease.",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in pancreatic carcinoma and evidence of common involvement of homocopolymer tracts in DNA microdeletions",
    "Abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a major cause of cancer death, and yet little is known about its molecular pathogenesis. We identified p53 mutations in 19 (70%) of 27 primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Most were missense point mutations, and the mutations were distributed primarily within the evolutionarily conserved domains. Transitions predominated over transversions, and many of the transitions were at CpG dinucleotides. Intragenic deletions accounted for 32% of mutations and were associated with decreased survival (P = 0.0016). A review of 1937 published p53 mutations revealed that the occurrence of small (1-2 base pairs) microdeletions varied among different types of human neoplasms and that pancreatic adenocarcinoma had one of the highest frequencies (13% of 47 mutations, P = 0.0036). Many small deletions occurred in iterations of single bases, but this did not fully account for their pattern of distribution, and there was evidence for the involvement of homocopolymer (polypurine:polypyrimidine) tracts. This may represent a more widespread phenomenon, because microdeletions occur in similar sequence patterns in reports of somatic and germ line mutations among genes other than p53",

No mutations were noted for H-, K-, and N-ras genes and only 2 of all the samples (5.6%) showed mutations at exon 8 of the p53 gene. Differences in unrelated microsatellites for tumor and normal DNA were detected in 9 (25.0%) of the cases examined. Somatic alterations in seven microsatellites, D3S1228, D3S643, D5S107, LPL5GT, D9S63, D17S261, and DCC, were found in 1 (2.8%), 3 (8.3%), 2 (5.7%), 5 (14.7%), 3 (8.3%), 3 (8.3%), and 3 (8.3%) cases, respectively. Five of 26 (19.2%) clear cell type and 4 of 10 (40.0%) non-clear cell type patients showed DNA instability. Two of 11 (18.2%) grade 1, 5 of 20 (25.0%) grade 2, and 2 of 5 (40.0%) grade 3 patients showed abnormal patterns. One of 2 (50.0%) stage pT1, 4 of 24 (16.7%) stage pT2, and 4 of 10 (40.0%) stage pT3 patients were shown to have microsatellite instability. In 4 of 9 alteration-positive cases (44.4%), mutations in multiple microsatellites were observed. Alterations in microsatellite instability may be more common in non-clear cell type, high-grade, and high-stage renal cell carcinoma patients",

    "Title": "p53 tumor suppressor gene mutation in early esophageal precancerous lesions and carcinoma among high-risk populations in Henan, China",
    "Abstract": "To understand whether p53 gene mutation is an early or late event in esophageal carcinogenesis, biopsy samples of esophageal epithelium from symptom-free subjects in a high incidence area, Huixian county of Henan Province, China, were analyzed. Mutations in exons 5, 6, 7, and 8 of p53 were analyzed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. Among the 37 biopsy samples showing accumulation of p53 protein in immunohistochemical staining, missense mutations of p53 gene were detected in 1 of 3 samples with normal epithelia, 3 of 23 samples with basal cell hyperplasia, and 4 of 11 samples with dysplasia. All mutations occurred at exon 5 with 3 at codon 175, 2 at codon 176, and 1 each at codons 159, 135, and codon 132. Of the 8 mutations, there were 3 G to A transitions and 3 G to T transversions. To understand the mutation spectrum and possible causative factors of esophageal cancer in this area, surgically resected human primary esophageal carcinomas from Linxian county were analyzed for p53 gene mutations in exons 5, 6, 7, and 8. Mutations were detected in 16 of 29 samples (55%). Twelve samples contained different missense point mutations, with 75% transitions (7 G to A and 2 A to G) and 25% transversions (2 G to T and 1 G to C). Most of the mutations were located at either exon 5 or exon 7. A deletion and an insertion of nucleotides leading to frame-shift mutations were detected in each of two other samples. The results demonstrate that p53 protein accumulation and gene mutation may occur at very early stages of esophageal carcinogenesis. In carcinomas, there was a higher frequency of p53 gene mutations, which accounts for most of the cases with p53 protein accumulation",

Seven of 18 FHBC tumors contained the same G to C transversion in codon 156. Novel alleles of altered length were seen in one or more loci on chromosome 17 in 15 of 18 patients with FHBC but only in a single locus in 8 of 14 patients with sporadic breast cancer. The frequency of tumors with mutations in p53, often multiple, accompanied by the appearance of multiple altered-length alleles suggest that DNA replication or repair defects may presage genomic instability in cases with FHBC",

    "Title": "Mutations in the conserved regions of p53 are infrequent in betel- associated oral cancers from Papua New Guinea",
    "Abstract": "Seventy-five % of the world's oral cancers arise in developing countries. In high incidence areas of Southeast Asia such as Papua New Guinea (PNG) the major region-specific risk exposure is betel quid chewing. While it has been shown that p53 gene mutations in the conserved midregion (exons 5-9) are a common feature of oral cancers in the developed world, there is no information on this type of genetic lesion in betel quid-associated oral cancers. We examined 50 oral squamous cell carcinomas, 20 from Baltimore, MD and 30 from PNG, for mutations in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene. DNA extracted from frozen biopsies was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, the purified product was sequenced directly, and mutations were confirmed by repeating the entire procedure. Mutations were found in 3 of 30 tumors from PNG (10%), whereas 9 mutations were detected among the 20 tumors (45%) from Baltimore, MD. This difference in frequency is statistically significant (P < 0.01) by chi 2 analysis. Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein, determined by immunohistochemistry with the CM-1 antiserum, was observed in the PNG cases harboring a missense mutation of the p53 gene. In agreement with the low number of PNG cancers with mutations, only 17% of the cases from PNG were immunostain positive. To explore whether less conserved regions of the gene are preferential targets for alterations in this patient group, sequence analysis in tumors from PNG was extended to outlying regions of the gene (all of exons 4 and 10, and splice sites), but mutations in only two additional tumors were identified. The presence of human papillomavirus DNA in PNG cases was examined with a polymerase chain reaction-based procedure, and viral sequences (human papillomavirus strains 11/16) were detected in two tumors. Human papillomavirus-triggered degradation of the tumor suppressor protein is thus unlikely to be a typical pathway to p53 dysfunction in tumors from PNG",

    "Title": "Evidence for a gene on 17p13.3, distal to TP53, as a target for allele loss in breast tumors without p53 mutations",
    "Abstract": "In breast cancer, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 17p is a frequent event and a likely target is the p53 gene on 17p13.1. However, several LOH mapping studies have indicated that, in some breast tumors, LOH affects only the most distal 17p markers, suggestive of a second tumor suppressor locus in 17p13.3. In order to distinguish which gene has most probably served as the target for LOH on 17p, we have screened 141 breast tumors for somatic mutations in the p53 gene in conjunction with detailed LOH mapping on the short arm of chromosome 17. A total of 32 mutations were detected in 31 tumors, 15 of which have never been reported in breast cancer before. The majority are point mutations leading to an amino acid change in the protein. In addition, we have stained a subset of 87 tumors for the p53 protein by immunohistochemistry. In 21 of these tumors (24%), nuclear staining was detected in over 25% of the tumor cells with the anti-p53 antibody DO7. A positive correlation was found between p53-positive staining and p53 mutation (P < 0.001). A strong association was observed between p53 mutation and LOH at the TP53 locus but not between p53 expression and LOH on 17p. In breast tumors without a detectable p53 mutation but with LOH on 17p, the 17p13.3 region is always involved and, in some cases, even exclusively involved. These results suggest that a second tumor suppressor gene, located distal to TP53, is targeted by LOH on 17p in some breast tumors and that a substantial number of breast tumors stabilize p53 through mechanisms other than mutation",

    "Title": "p53 mutations and microsatellite instability in sporadic gastric cancer: when guardians fail",
    "Abstract": "Genetic instability may underlie the etiology of multistep gastric carcinogenesis. The altered microsatellites observed in tumors with the ubiquitous somatic mutation (USM) phenotype may represent the expression of such instability. Similarly, p53 mutations may allow the accumulation of genetic alterations caused by multiple mechanisms. In 40 sporadic gastric adenocarcinomas, nine tumors (22.5%) with p53 mutations in exons 5-8, and six tumors (15%) with the USM+ phenotype, were detected. None of the tumors had both alterations. The tumors with p53 mutations were predominantly in the proximal stomach whereas the USM+ tumors were predominantly in the distal stomach. The mutant p53 alleles were homogeneously distributed throughout the primary tumors, but usually absent from adjacent normal or dysplastic epithelium, indicating that p53 mutations are typically acquired before the bulk of clonal expansion. The loss of mutant p53 alleles during progression was also rarely observed in metastatic foci. Altered microsatellites were homogeneously present in the USM+ primary and metastatic tumors and one synchronous tubular adenoma, but were not detected in adjacent normal and metaplastic epithelium. These findings also demonstrate that the USM+ phenotype is expressed before the bulk of clonal expansion. In most (5 of 6) USM+ tumors, the sizes of the altered microsatellites differed between regions, indicating that the instability usually persists during clonal expansion. These findings indicate that both p53 mutations and the USM+ phenotype are present prior to the bulk of tumor growth and therefore may contribute to, rather than be a late consequence of, malignant transformation",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutation and mdm2 gene amplification are uncommon in medulloblastoma",
    "Abstract": "Loss of heterozygosity is common for the short arm of chromosome 17 in medulloblastomas, and putative medulloblastoma suppressor loci have been localized to 17p13. The colocalization of the p53 tumor suppressor gene to 17p13 raises the possibility that its mutant alleles may play a role in the malignant transformation of 'medulloblasts.' Mutations and deletions of the p53 gene have been described in many tumor types and in the germline of some individuals with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, but reports on the status of the p53 and mdm2 (a gene coding for a p53- associated protein reportedly amplified in human sarcomas) genes in medulloblastomas are few and an indication of their roles, if any, in the etiology of this important childhood tumor has yet to emerge. Here we have analyzed polymerase chain reaction-amplified products of exons 4-9 (95% of reported p53 mutations occur within this region) of the p53 gene in 9 medulloblastomas for potential mutations using the technique of single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. We found only one mutation, an A-T to T-A transversion involving the second base of codon 285 and resulting in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid, amplification of the mdm2 gene could be detected in zero of eight of these tumors. These findings suggest that genetic events associated with the inactivation of p53 gene occur in only a minor subset of medulloblastomas",

Aneuploid cell populations from Barrett's adenocarcinomas have a high prevalence of 17p allelic losses, and there is substantial evidence that the target of these losses is the p53 gene. If 17p allelic losses lead to aneuploidy in Barrett's esophagus, then they should be present in diploid cells from patients who develop aneuploidy. We detected 17p allelic losses in diploid cells from 10 of 11 patients (91%) with Barrett's esophagus who developed aneuploid cell populations. Our data strongly suggest that 17p allelic losses precede the development of aneuploidy during neoplastic progression in Barrett's esophagus in vivo and, therefore, support in vitro evidence for the role of p53 in genetic instability",

To investigate whether MASA can be applied to sensitive detection of lymph node metastasis, we screened 22 colorectal cancers for K-ras and p53 mutations and examined corresponding regional lymph node at the genetic level by the MASA method. Six of the primary tumors were found to certain K-ras mutations, and nine exhibited mutations of the p53 gene. In seven of the 14 cases in which genetic alterations were identified (mutations in both genes were found in one tumor), we found discrepancies between the genetic and the histopathological diagnoses with respect to the presence or absence of cancer cells in lymph nodes, in that these patients were histologically diagnosed lymph node negative, hn(-) but genetically diagnosed lymph node positive, gn(+). Because disease recurs in 20-30% of cancer patients whose lymph nodes are histopathologically negative after surgery, genetic evaluation of lymph nodes for metastasis may become a useful prognostic indicator",

    "Title": "A frequent alteration of p53 gene in carcinoma in adenoma of colon",
    "Abstract": "In general, colorectal carcinoma is thought to originate mainly from adenoma, and this pathway is called the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Carcinoma in adenoma is an appropriate model for analysis of this mechanism, because adenoma and carcinoma tissues coexist in the same polyp and the carcinoma is thought to have originated from the surrounding adenoma. Expression of the p53 protein was analyzed in 36 cases of carcinoma in adenoma in the colon by immunohistochemistry using an anti-human p53 monoclonal antibody (PAb1801). Alterations of the p53 gene were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction for microanalysis of normal mucosa, adenoma, and carcinoma from histological slides. Mutations were assessed by the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and identified by DNA sequencing in some cases. Loss of heterozygosity was studied by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Positive staining for p53 was detected in three (8%) of 37 adenomas and 20 (53%) of 38 focal carcinomas. One (7%) of 15 adenomas with mild dysplasia, three (14%) of 22 adenomas with moderate dysplasia, and 16 (42%) of 38 focal carcinomas had a mutation in exon 5 through exon 8 of the p53 gene. As for allelic loss in the p53 gene locus, only one adenoma with moderate dysplasia had loss of heterozygosity, whereas six (40%) of 15 focal carcinomas had loss of heterozygosity. Of those tumors (3 of 37 adenomas and 20 of 38 focal carcinomas) that reacted with PAb1801, 78% (18 of 23) showed genetic alterations. Among 52 tumors which showed negative staining, five tumors had a p53 mutation and four of them were nonsense mutations. Putting all of these results together, 71% (24 of 34) of the cases underwent p53 gene and protein alterations during the conversion from adenoma to focal carcinoma. These data clearly indicate that genetic alterations of p53 are involved mainly in the malignant transformation from adenoma to focal carcinoma in colon carcinogenesis. In addition, some cases show heterogeneity of the p53 gene in carcinoma in adenoma of the colon. There may be other pathways than p53 responsible for malignant change in the colon",

    "Abstract": "Genetic alterations in the p53 and mdm2 genes have been reported to occur in soft tissue sarcomas. This study was designed to determine the prevalence and potential clinical value of detected molecular abnormalities and altered patterns of expression of mdm2 and p53 genes in adult soft tissue sarcomas. A cohort of 211 soft tissue sarcomas from adults that were both clinically and pathologically well characterized was analyzed. Monoclonal antibodies directed against mdm2 and p53 proteins were used to measure overexpression of these proteins in the nuclei of cells from sections of these tumors. Seventy-six of 207 tumors had abnormally high levels of mdm2 proteins and 56 of 211 tumors overexpressed p53 protein. Twenty-two cases had abnormally high levels of both mdm2 and p53 proteins based upon immunoreactivity with these antibodies. There was a striking statistically significant correlation between the overexpression of p53 and mdm2 proteins in the same tumor and poor survival (P < 0.05) of the patients. A group of 73 soft tissue sarcomas was chosen for analysis using Southern blots, single strand conformation polymorphisms, and direct DNA sequencing to confirm mdm2 gene amplifications and p53 mutations and correlate these with the results of the immunoreactivities. The overexpression of p53 and mdm2 proteins in the nuclei of tumor cells did not always correlate well with gene amplification at the mdm2 locus or mutation at the p53 gene. The possible reasons for these discrepancies are discussed",

    "Title": "p53 mutations are confined to the comedo type ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast. Immunohistochemical and sequencing data",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been identified in breast and many other carcinomas. It is not clear, however, when these mutations occur during breast carcinogenesis. Overexpression of 53 protein has been reported in some ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions. To further study the overexpression of p53 in DCIS of the breast and correlate these findings with changes at the molecular level, we performed p53 immunostaining and direct sequencing in noncomedo and comedo DCIS. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Archival blocks were obtained on cases of noncomedo DCIS, (including encysted, noninvasive papillary carcinoma) and comedo DCIS. Immunohistochemical staining with the p53 antibody DO7 was performed on all cases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of exons 5, 6, and 7 of the p53 gene was performed and the PCR products were directly sequenced. Four comedo DCIS cases that were p53 immunopositive were further screened for p53 mutations by PCR/single strand conformation polymorphism in exons 8 and 9 of the p53 gene. One of these cases showing a mobility shift was directly sequenced. RESULTS: We examined 39 lesions including comedo DCIS (N = 12) and noncomedo DCIS (N = 27), the latter including 17 encysted noninvasive papillary carcinomas. Immunostaining with DO7 was positive in 4 of 12 comedo DCIS lesions (33%) while all noncomedo lesions including encysted noninvasive papillary carcinomas were negative. Direct sequencing of PCR products confirmed wild-type DNA in exons 5 and 6 in all noninvasive papillary carcinomas, 3 randomly selected noncomedo DCIS lesions, and 4 p53 antibody-positive comedo DCIS lesions. In these latter 4 cases, wild-type DNA sequences were preserved in exon 7 for all cases. A single case had a conformational shift in exon 8 within the four cases screened in exons 8 and 9. Direct DNA sequencing of this exon revealed a G to A point mutation resulting in an arginine-to-histidine substitution at codon 273 of the protein. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that mutant p53 protein accumulation in preinvasive lesions is limited to comedo (high grade) DCIS and that p53 positivity by immunohistochemistry does not correlate in all cases with specific p53 mutations in exons 5 to 9, the most highly conserved regions of this gene",

    "Title": "The association of p53 immunopositivity with tumor proliferation and other prognostic indicators in breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "Abnormal accumulation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene product was analyzed in 198 primary invasive human breast carcinomas. In 47 of these cases, single-strand conformational polymorphism was used to detect mutations in the highly conserved exons 5-9 of the gene. Mutations as determined by single-strand conformational polymorphism were found in 15 of 15 strongly immunopositive cases (100%) and 3 of 23 immunonegative cases (13%). There were also nine cases with < 1% immunopositive cells (borderline immunopositivity); p53 mutations were detected in seven of these cases. The results suggest that p53 immunopositivity is a highly specific, albeit somewhat insensitive surrogate for p53 mutations. p53 accumulation, detected by immunohistochemical methods using antibody PAb 1801, was noted in 29.8% of the cases and was associated with estrogen receptor (ER) negativity (P = 0.0003), progesterone receptor (PR) negativity (P = 0.008), and high histological grade (P = 0.037) by univariate analysis. Incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine was used to determine the percentage of cells synthesizing DNA (proliferative fraction). When bromodeoxyuridine was administered either in vivo (n = 93) or in vitro (n = 79), p53 accumulation was only marginally related to proliferative fraction (P = 0.067 by chi 2; P = 0.055 by Mann-Whitney). When tumors were segregated by ER status, the aforementioned associations of p53 immunopositivity with PR negativity, high histological grade, and increased proliferation rate lost their significance. p53 accumulation did not correlate with tumor size, clinical stage, axillary node metastases, or age at diagnosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "Title": "c-k-ras and p53 mutations occur very early in adenocarcinoma of the lung",
    "Abstract": "The topographical distribution of a mutation provides insight into past patterns of tumor evolution. This approach was applied to two loci commonly mutated in adenocarcinoma of the lung--p53 and c-K-ras. In 41 primary adenocarcinomas, c-K-ras codon 12 point mutations were detected in 8 (19.5%) tumors and p53 point mutations were detected in 10 (24.4%) tumors, with one tumor harboring both mutations. These mutations were only detected in malignant cells and with a homogeneous topographical distribution throughout 16 tumors, including metastasis. Intratumor heterogeneity was detected in only one tumor in which a small portion lacked the specific p53 mutation. Based on this topographical analysis, it is likely that when these mutations occur in adenocarcinoma of the lung, they are usually acquired during the very earliest phases of tumor formation before the bulk of clonal expansion, and in very small precursor lesions",

    "Title": "Ultraviolet-induced p53 mutations in atypical fibroxanthoma",
    "Abstract": "Atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) is an uncommon neoplasm of the superficial soft tissue occurring in actinically damaged skin of elderly patients. Sun-exposed skin also represents the main site of squamous and basal cell carcinomas and malignant melanoma, and a key role for ultraviolet (UV) radiation in their pathogenesis has long been suspected. UV- related mutations of the p53 gene have been identified in human skin cancers. To verify whether the pathogenesis of AFX is related to the effect of sunlight, p53 protein and gene status have been investigated in a series of 10 cases of AFX. Seven of 10 showed p53 immunoreactivity in most of the neoplastic cells. Molecular analysis of the p53 gene revealed an abnormal single strand conformation polymorphism pattern in all the p53 positive cases. Polymerase chain reaction direct sequencing revealed that all the mutations involved cytosine bases. Four cases showed C to T transitions (including two CC-TT double base substitutions) and two cases showed C to G transversion. All but one mutation took place at dipyrimidine sites. These findings provide the first objective evidence for the central role of UV radiation in the development of AFX and also represent the first in vivo demonstration of solar UV-induced mutations in a human mesenchymal neoplasm",

    "Abstract": "This study was designed to determine the frequency of structural genetic abnormalities of chromosome 17 and the incidence of TP53 mutations as they relate to the biological behavior of adult soft tissue sarcomas. We analyzed a group of 73 soft tissue sarcomas of adults that were clinically and pathologically well characterized using molecular genetic techniques and expression studies. We then correlated genotype and phenotype with pathological parameters. Overall, allelic loss of 17p and 17q was identified in 53 and 29% of informative cases, respectively. p53 nuclear overexpression was detected in 34% of the tumors analyzed. We observed an association between 17p deletions and tumor presentation being more frequent in recurrent and metastatic tumors than primary lesion. p53 nuclear overexpression was associated with tumor grade, size, and more frequently detected in metastatic than primary sarcomas. The 11 intragenic mutations characterized included 10 cases of single base substitution and one single base deletion; 8 were of the missense type and 3 were nonsense. It is concluded that 17p deletions and TP53 mutations are common events in adult soft tissue sarcomas and that due to the trends observed with the cohort of patients analyzed they may become prognostic markers for patients affected with these tumors",

    "Title": "Patterns of p53 mutations in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Acquisition at a relatively early age",
    "Abstract": "Squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) of the lung is thought to arise after the accumulation of multiple mutations, including p53. To better characterize when p53 mutations are acquired, 37 SQCC of the lung were examined by polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Somatic p53 mutations were detected in nine tumors (24.3%). There were no significant differences in the stage, sex, or race between patients with or without p53 mutations. However, the patients with SQCC and p53 mutations were significantly (P = 0.0006) younger (mean age, 54.3 years) compared with patients without p53 mutations (mean age, 65). The topographical tissue distributions of the p53 mutations were examined by selective ultraviolet radiation fractionation. In all nine cases, the specific p53 mutant alleles were homogeneously present throughout the primary tumors, in all three examples with in situ carcinoma, and in all four cases with metastases. In one case, squamous metaplasia contiguous with the primary tumor also contained the same p53 mutation. Normal or hyperplastic and metaplastic or dysplastic epithelium not contiguous with the primary tumors lacked the specific p53 mutations. These findings suggest that p53 mutations are commonly acquired at a relatively early age, before the bulk of clonal expansion, and usually persist throughout the progression of SQCC of the lung",

    "Abstract": "We have investigated the involvement of the p53 and RB1 tumor- suppressor genes in 26 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis, including 17 myeloid, eight lymphoid, and one megakaryoblastic crisis. The presence of p53 mutations in exons 5 through 9 was tested by the PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay, followed by PCR-direct sequencing; in addition, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 17p13, the site of the p53 gene, was assayed by Southern blot. Given the variability of the mechanisms of inactivation of the RB1 gene in human tumors, a combination of Southern blot and mutational analysis by PCR-SSCP was used. p53 mutations were restricted to one case of myeloid blast crisis, showing a CGC-->TGC (Arg-->Cys) mutation at codon 283; two additional cases displayed LOH at 17p13 in the absence of p53 mutations. No molecular lesions of the RB1 gene were detected in any of the cases analyzed. These data indicate that inactivation of p53 and RB1 is a rare event in the molecular pathogenesis of CML acute transformation",

    "Abstract": "p53 alterations at the DNA, mRNA and protein levels were studied in tumour metastases sampled from 30 patients with malignant melanoma. Paraffin-embedded sections from these and an additional 12 patients were examined for the presence of p53 protein. TP53 gene aberrations were found in 7 of 30 (23%) of the patients, six of which showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Point mutations were detected in only two cases, one of which had LOH whereas the other was non-informative. Increased levels of p53 mRNA were present in only one tumour with, but in six cases without, detectable DNA abnormalities. Four of the latter and six tumours with normal transcript levels had immunohistochemically detectable levels of p53 protein. In 25 cases in which corresponding primary and metastatic lesions could be compared, closely similar immunoreactivity patterns were observed. Increased expression of the MDM2 gene was found in only one tumour in parallel with overexpression of p53. Altogether, the data indicate that inactivation of the p53 regulatory pathway is not of major significance in the tumorigenesis of malignant melanoma. However, a significant association was found between p53 immunoreactivity and the relapse-free period in patients with superficial spreading melanoma. That increased protein expression was predominantly found in tumours without DNA alterations might suggest a role for the wild-type p53 protein in restricting malignant cell proliferation in these cases",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in cervical carcinogenesis--low frequency and lack of correlation with human papillomavirus status",
    "Abstract": "p53 gene aberrations are common in human malignancies, and recent studies suggest that in cervical carcinoma p53 function is inactivated either by complex formation with human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 product or by gene mutation. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), we examined the mutational status of the four 'hotspot' regions of the p53 gene in 47 primary cervical carcinomas. HPV status was determined, also by PCR. In 20 of these cases, we examined for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 17p13. In the 47 carcinomas, and in a further 68 biopsy specimens from normal, premalignant and malignant cervix, we investigated aberrant immunocytochemical expression of p53. Immunocytochemically, abnormal p53 expression was detected in 13 of 115 cases (8/57 carcinomas). Somatic mutation in p53 was detected in 1 of 47 cervical carcinomas; 36 were positive for HPV 16, 18 or 33. A low level of allele loss (3 out of 20 cases) was detected on chromosome 17p, occurring in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative cases, and in cases with and without p53 mutations. We conclude that somatic mutation in the hotspot regions of the p53 gene occurs infrequently in cervical carcinomas; that immunocytochemically detectable levels of p53 are also infrequent; and that there is no consistent correlation between p53 mutational status, LOH on chromosome 17p or HPV status in these cancers",

    "Title": "p53 mutations and overexpression in locally advanced breast cancers",
    "Abstract": "Alterations in the p53 gene were analysed in 39 patients with locally advanced breast cancers (LABCs) (stage III-IV) with inflammatory signs in most cases (UICC stage T4d = 32 patients) by molecular and immunohistochemical (IHC) approaches. All patients were included in the same therapy protocol. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a single-strand conformational polymorphism migration technique (SSCP), the presence of mutations in exons 2-11, covering the entire coding sequence of the p53 gene, was evaluated. Using the mouse specific anti- human p53 monoclonal antibody (PAb 1801), we also looked for overexpression of the p53 protein in tissue sections. In 16 cases shifted bands were reproducibly identified by PCR-SSCP, and all but one (localised to exon 10) were in exons 5-8, the usual mutational hotspots. Fifteen of these 16 samples were sequenced and 14 of the suspected mutations (36%) were confirmed. Most of them (12) were single nucleotide substitutions, and transitions were more frequent (eight cases) than transversions (four cases). Fourteen of the tumour samples were positively stained with the monoclonal antibody PAb 1801, 11 with nuclear staining only, two with mixed cytoplasmic and nuclear staining and one with cytoplasmic staining only. Staining patterns were very heterogeneous in terms of the percentage of positive cells (10-75%) and their distribution in the tissue section (isolated foci or dispersed cells). In 11 of the 14 mutated cases a positive immunostaining was observed. The presence of a p53 mutation was significantly associated with larger tumour diameter (chi 2 = 7.490, P = 0.0062) and the presence of clinical metastases (stage IV) (chi 2 = 10.113, P = 0.0015). A non-statistically significant trend of association was observed between p53 mutation, negative oestrogen receptors and lower response rate to therapy. Our results in this group of patients and the heterogeneity of the staining of tumour cells in tissue sections suggest that p53 mutations could be a late event in this non-familial form of breast cancer",

    "Abstract": "In this study we have screened a series of 29 primary leiomyosarcomas for abnormalities of both the p53 gene and the MDM2 gene, which encodes a p53-associated protein. SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism) analysis and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA were used to establish that 6/29 tumours possessed point mutations of the p53 gene. Using a monoclonal antibody that recognises the p53 protein in immunohistochemical staining experiments, we observed overexpression of the p53 protein in five of the six tumours containing point mutations in the p53 gene. Southern analysis of tumour DNA revealed that 2/29 tumours demonstrated amplification of the MDM2 gene. When considered together, these results indicate that alterations in both the p53 gene and MDM2 gene are important in the development of a significant minority of leiomyosarcomas. In addition, we have demonstrated a significant association between the presence of abnormalities of the p53 gene or MDM2 genes in leiomyosarcomas and a more advanced clinicopathological stage (P = 0.03). We have also examined the role of the DCC tumour- suppressor gene in the development of human soft-tissue tumours in a variety of histological types. Except for evidence of a rearrangement in a single leiomyosarcoma cell line, SK-UT-1, we have found no direct evidence to support a role for mutation of the gene in the development of human soft-tissue tumours",

    "Title": "p53 mutations have no additional prognostic value over stage in bladder cancer",
    "Abstract": "Evidence is accumulating that the tumour-suppressor gene p53 is involved in the development of bladder cancer. Therefore we studied p53 mutations in 47 bladder cancers obtained from 45 patients using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR- SSCP) analysis. Eight out of 24 invasive tumours appeared to have a p53 mutation, while no p53 mutations were found in the superficial tumours. All the p53 mutations were found in grade 3 tumours. The tumours with altered p53 showed a higher frequency of allelic loss (FAL) than the tumours without a mutation (55.8% vs 21.1%, P < 0.05, chi 2 test). This increase in FAL suggests a correlation between p53 mutations and genetic instability. A significant correlation between mutated p53 and poor survival in the whole group studied was found (P < 0.001, log-rank test). However, within the group of muscle-invasive tumours the occurrence of p53 mutations had no additional prognostic value. Therefore, even though p53 mutations were found in aggressive tumours, the clinical usefulness of its detection seems limited. Nevertheless, these results imply that p53 is involved in the clinical behaviour of bladder cancer; its role in the progression of superficial cancer to invasive disease merits further attention",

    "Title": "The p53 status of cultured human premalignant oral keratinocytes",
    "Abstract": "Around 60% of oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) have been shown to harbour p53 mutations, and other studies have demonstrated mutant p53 genes in normal and dysplastic squamous epithelium adjacent to these SCCs. In line with these earlier studies we show here that DOK, a keratinocyte cell line derived from a dysplasia, displays elevated levels of p53 protein and harbours a 12 bp in-frame deletion of the p53 gene spanning codons 188-191. In contrast, the coding region of the p53 gene was normal in a series of six benign recurrent laryngeal papillomas and a series of four premalignant oral erythroplakia biopsies and their cell cultures. All but one of these lesions were free of malignancy at the time of biopsy, in contrast to the premalignant lesions studied by previous investigators, but keratinocytes cultured from these lesions all displayed a partially transformed phenotype that was less pronounced than that of DOK. Since three out of four of the erythroplakia patients developed SCC within 1 year of biopsy, these lesions were by definition premalignant. The availability of strains of partially transformed keratinocytes from premalignant erythroplakias which possess normal p53 genes should enable us to test the role of mutant p53 in the progression of erythroplakia to SCC. The premalignant tissues and cultures were also tested for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is known to inactivate p53 function in some cases. Only the benign papillomas were shown to contain high levels of either HPV 6 or HPV 11 E6 DNA, but not both, and none of the samples contained detectable levels of HPV 16, HPV 18 or HPV 33 E6 DNA or L1 DNA of several other HPV types. There was therefore no evidence to suggest that p53 was being inactivated by a highly oncogenic HPV in these samples",

The underlying assumption has been that positive staining indicates a mutation in the p53 coding sequence. Recently, however, discordancy has been observed and the accuracy of ICC as a marker of p53 gene mutation has been questioned. In this study of 109 colorectal adenocarcinomas, we compared ICC staining with p53 gene mutations detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Concordancy between the two techniques was found in 69% of tumours. ICC-positive/SSCP-negative cases accounted for 20% of tumours and ICC-negative/SSCP-positive cases for the remaining 11%. These results caution against the assumption that p53 protein overexpression is always associated with a gene mutation.

    "Title": "Alteration of p53 gene in ovarian carcinoma: clinicopathological correlation and prognostic significance",
    "Abstract": "Inactivation of the tumour-suppressor gene p53 has been demonstrated in a variety of human tumours. We extracted DNA from paraffin-embedded tissues of 67 ovarian carcinoma samples (54 primary tumours, seven metastases and six tumours obtained after chemotherapy), and analysed allelic losses and mutations of the p53 gene using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of DNA fragments amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Allelic loss was observed in 24 of 32 informative cases. The mutation was detected in 14 of 54 primary ovarian carcinomas: eight serous cystadenocarcinomas (SCA), 42%), five endometrioid adenocarcinomas (EA, 42%) and one mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (14%). The incidence of the alteration was higher in SCA and EA than in other histological types, but the difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of p53 gene abnormalities in ovarian carcinomas tended to be increased in patients with disease advanced (over FIGO stage II). Mutations were found in exons 5 and 7 only and consisted mainly of single nucleotide substitutions [9 or 14 (64%) in exon 7; 4 of 14 (29%) in exon 5]. In 13 of 14 cases, p53 gene mutations occurred concomitantly with losses of the normal allele. The status of the p53 gene in metastases and the tumours obtained after chemotherapy was identical to that in the primary tumours. The presence of p53 gene mutation did not correlate with histological grade, response to primary therapy and survival. These findings suggest that mutational alterations of the p53 gene are involved in the development of a significant proportion of some ovarian carcinomas (SCAs or EAs), especially in advanced stages. However, they may not be a marker predicting the biological behaviour or the outcome of the disease",

    "Title": "Immunohistochemical detection of mutant p53 protein in epithelial ovarian cancer using polyclonal antibody CMI: correlation with histopathology and clinical features",
    "Abstract": "Approximately 30-50% of cases of ovarian adenocarcinoma harbour mutations in the p53 tumour-suppressor gene associated with elevated levels of the protein detected by immunohistochemical staining. To investigate any relation between the presence of mutant p53 and clinicopathological features of disease, we examined a series of 50 cases of epithelial ovarian adenocarcinoma for expression of p53 by immunohistological staining on fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections using the polyclonal antibody CM1, and by direct nucleotide sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA from selected cases. Of the 50 cases examined, 28 (56%) were p53 positive and there was no significant correlation between p53 status and differentiation stage, clinical (FIGO) stage, multidrug resistance (mdr-1 P-glycoprotein) expression or response to treatment. However, we observed a statistically significant difference between the high prevalence of p53- positive serous tumours (18 out of 23) and the lower prevalence of p53- positive cases in mucinous tumours (3 of 12) suggesting that factors related to disease aetiology, associated with these histological subtypes, may determine the prevalence of functional inactivation of the p53 tumour-suppressor gene in ovarian adenocarcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 gene were investigated in 116 surgically removed primary brain tumor tissues by PCR-SSCP analysis. The mutations did not follow a random distribution among the various different subtypes, but occurred in 21.0% (13/62) of astrocytomas, 13.0% (3/23) of oligodendrogliomas and 35% (7/20) 35% (7/20) of PNETs. No mutation was found in the ependymomas. The majority of mutations identified in this study were G:C to A:T or C:G to T:A transitions (56.0%, 14 of 25) and occurred most frequently (56.0%, 14 of 25) at sites of CpG dinucleotides. Interestingly, codon 158 is a new hot spot which occurred with a frequency of 16.0% (4 of 25) in the samples analyzed",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the accumulation of p53 proteins after heat stress and their association with HSP72/HSC73 using four human glioblastoma cell lines. Human glioblastoma cell lines U-87MG and A-172 exhibited no mutation in the region between the 2nd and 11th exons of the p53 gene, whereas A-7 and T98G had mutations in exon 5 and exon 7 of the p53 gene, respectively. In U-87MG and A-172, the levels of wild-type p53 protein were slightly increased by heat stress. Levels of mutant p53 protein were apparently increased by heat stress in A-7, but not in T98G. Furthermore, wild-type p53 proteins in both U-87MG and A-172 co- immunoprecipitated with anti-HSP72/HSC73 antibody and HSP72 and HSC73 in them co-immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 antibody as did the mutant p53 proteins. These findings suggest that p53 proteins accumulated by heat stress are associated with HSP72 and HSC73",

DNA sequencing was carried out to confirm the occurrence of p53 mutation. While 92% of the tumor specimens were found to carry EBV DNA, only 1/25 showed the incidence of a homozygous mutation at codon 248 of the p53 gene. The data showed that despite a high association of EBV infection with Saudi NPC, the frequency of p53 mutations was very low. Our results are consistent with the worldwide observation of infrequent p53 mutations in NPC",

    "Abstract": "A biomarker of skin cancer would be beneficial in evaluating the efficacy of potential cancer chemoprevention agents. To this end, we investigated the tumor suppressor gene p53 in precancerous actinic keratosis lesions (AK) and malignant squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) using polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP) techniques. In addition, p53 protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistical analysis with the PAB 1801 monoclonal antibody. Nine out of 13 (69%) SCCs and 8 of 15 (53%) AKs were positive for p53 mutations. In contrast, normal skin samples were negative for p53 mutations. Sequence analysis of AKs and SCCs showed primarily C to T transition mutations. Nuclear immunochemical staining for p53 was observed in 12/15 (80%) AK and 12/13 (92%) SSCs. These results suggest that p53 mutations may be involved in the malignant conversion of AKs to SCCs and that p53 may be useful as a biomarker to study the potential modulatory effects of cancer chemopreventive agents against skin cancer",

Two inner nodules revealed distinct mutations while the surrounding early HCC lesion was negative for mutation.

    "Abstract": "Reports of cases of flat-type colorectal tumors are increasing in Japan, but almost nothing has been elucidated about the genetic abnormalities of these tumors. In this study, we have examined p53 mutations in six cases of colon cancer cell lines, 22 cases of flat- type colorectal tumors, and 27 cases of polypoid-type colorectal tumors using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE); the latter has recently been developed as a screening method for gene mutations. p53 mutations were observed in four colon cancer cell lines, six flat-type colorectal tumors, and three polypoid-type colorectal tumors, all of which were analyzed by direct sequencing. These mutations were observed only in adenomas with high-grade dysplasia and in colorectal cancers but not in adenomas with low-grade dysplasia. These observations suggest that p53 gene mutations are involved in flat-type as well as polypoid-type colorectal tumors at relatively later stages of carcinogenesis and that TGGE seems to be useful as one of the rapid screening methods",

    "Title": "Frameshift and nonsense p53 mutations in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck: Non-reactivity with three anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies",
    "Abstract": "p53 mutations in human tumors are often associated with overexpression of p53, and immunohistochemical detection of p53 has frequently been chosen as a simpler method than genetic analysis to access p53 mutations. In this study, we analyzed the p53 gene by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing, and correlated findings to Ab staining results. In a series of 58 squamous cell carcinoma, 15 showed mutations in exons 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 by SSCP. Of these 15 cases, 11 were positive by antibody staining, and DNA sequencing showed missense mutations but no frameshift or nonsense mutations. In contrast, the antibody-negative cases had frameshift or nonsense mutations, but no missense mutations. SSCP analysis of these 4 cases showed mutations in exon 6 (2 cases), exon 7 (1), and exon 8 (1), respectively. In case 1, sequencing data revealed a single-base addition in exon 6, leading to a truncated gene product of 207 amino acids (aa), in contrast to 393 aa in wild-type p53. Similar frameshift mutations were shown in case 2 and case 3. Case 4, instead of a frameshift mutation, carried a nonsense mutation, and a truncated peptide of 235 aa. All these mutations thus shared the feature of producing truncated p53 products nonreactive with antibodies. We conclude that frameshift mutations as well as nonsense mutations can lead to altered p53 undetectable by available monoclonal antibodies. Our finding indicates that the absence of Ab reactivity does not rule out genetic alterations of the p53 gene in human tumors.",

    "Title": "Mutations of p53 gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) correlate with tumor progression and patient prognosis: a study of 138 patients with unifocal HCC",
    "Abstract": "The mutation spectrum of p53 gene and its biological significance were studied in 138 patients with unifocal primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Taiwan. The p53 mutations were detected in 51 cases (37%); 36 (71%) were missense mutations. The others (29%) included mutations at the intron-exon junctions (5 cases), deletion or insertion (4 cases), nonsense mutations (4 cases), and silent mutations (2 cases). The mutation sites were scattered from exons 4 to 10, predominantly (75%) in exons 5, 7, and 8. Of these mutations, 72% were transversions, mostly G:C --> T:A change (46%); while only 28% were transitions. Mutation occurred at codon 249 only in 14 cases (10%), but accounted for 27% of the mutations. The p53 mutations correlated with allele loss of p53 locus (52% vs 17% p<0.02), alpha-fetoprotein elevation (45% vs 28%, p<0.04), and poorly differentiated HCC (46% vs 10%, p<0.0001). The p53 mutation rate was two times higher in large than in small HCC (48% vs 26%, p<0.008), and in more advanced tumor (stage 3 vs stages 1 and 2: 49% vs 21%, p<0.0007). HCC patients with mutated p53 gene had a worse outcome (5-year survival; 18% vs 38%, p<0.008). We conclude that p53 gene mutation is common in advanced HCC, occurs as a late event in HCC growth, correlates with tumor progression and aggression, and is a useful molecular prognostic parameter of HCC. The p53 mutation patterns did not correlate with HBV or HCV infection. The frequency of p53 mutations did not differ between Taiwanese patients and mainland Chinese in Taiwan. However, mutation at codon 249 was more common in Taiwanese patients (p<0.05), while mutations of other types more frequent in the mainlanders (p<0.03). Hence endogenous and exogenous factors other than aflatoxin may also play a role in p53 mutation in HCC.",

    "Abstract": "GADD45 (growth arrest and DNA damage) is a DNA-damage-inducible gene regulated in part by the tumor suppressor p53. A role in negative growth control has recently been suggested based on significant (more than 75%) reduction of colony formation following over expression of Gadd45. To better understand the role of Gadd45, we have developed specific rabbit and murine antibodies raised against the human recombinant protein. Using these antibodies, we have found that in ML-1 cells Gadd45 is predominantly a nuclear protein. MyD118, a protein induced by terminal differentiation sharing 57% homology with Gadd45, does not cross-react with any of the antibodies produced. As expected, the induction of Gadd45 protein by ionizing radiation (IR) was also found to be dependent on a wild type p53 phenotype. Interestingly, WI- L2-NS, a human lymphoid cell line, showed very high basal levels of Gadd45 mRNA and protein in addition to a high constitutive level of a mutated p53 protein. In this cell line, the high levels of GADD45 did not inhibit cellular growth in spite of the fact that no mutations were found in GADD45 sequence. These results indicate that some cell line(s) can tolerate high levels of Gadd45 and abrogate its growth suppression function",

    "Abstract": "Tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas (a total of 14) were examined both for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA and for p53 alterations. General primer-mediated HPV polymerase chain reaction (GP-PCR) revealed the presence of HPV DNA in 12/14 cases.  Subsequent typing by HPV type-specific PCR and sequence or hybridization analysis of GP-PCR products revealed DNA from HPV 16 in seven cases, from HPV 33 in two cases, and from HPV 7, HPV 16/33 and HPV 33/59 each in a single case. p53 immunohistochemistry performed on nine HPV containing tonsillar carcinomas using polyclonal serum CM-1 showed elevated p53 levels in four cases.  These included 3/5 HPV 16 containing carcinomas and the HPV 33/59 containing carcinoma.  Analysis of p53 mutations using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of GC-clamped PCR products of exons 5 to 8 showed p53 gene alterations in 3/13 cases, including 2/11 HPV positive cases and 1/2 HPV negative cases. The alterations included a silent point mutation within exon 8 of an HPV 16 containing carcinoma, a 1 bp deletion within exon 8 of an HPV 33 containing carcinoma, and a missense mutation within exon 7 of one of theHPV negative carcinomas. There was evident discrepancy between p53 immunohistochemistry and gene analysis. Four HPV containing cases showing elevated p53 levels did not reveal the presence of exon 5 to 8 alterations affecting the amino acid code, suggesting the presence of mutations occurring in other exons or non-mutational p53 stabilization. The data indicate that HPV and elevated p53 can coexist in tonsillar carcinomas and that despite the low frequency of p53 mutations the presence of HPV is not exclusively related to the absence of mutated p53.",

    "Abstract": "We have previously reported the absence of mutations within exons 5-9 of the p53 gene in a panel of 30 cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which represent the M3 FAB type of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the present report, we extend our analysis of p53 gene mutations to 70 cases of AML representative of the other FAB types of the disease, including M1 (16 cases), M2 (20 cases), M4 (17 cases), M5 (12 cases), and M6 (5 cases). DNAs were analyzed for p53 gene mutations in exons 5 to 9 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and direct sequencing of PCR-amplified products. Mutant p53 alleles were detected in 5 of 70 cases; 1 case in exon 5, 2 cases in exon 6, and 2 cases in exon 7. The alterations of the p53 gene were represented by point mutation leading to an amino acid substitution in four cases, and deletion in the remaining case. In four of the five cases, direct sequencing indicated the loss of the normal p53 allele; in the remaining case, two mutations were detected, presumably involving both p53 alleles. Three cases showed mutations at diagnosis; in the remaining two, the mutations were observed in clinical relapse but not at diagnosis. Our results confirm the relatively low incidence of p53 mutations in AML and further support the evidence that p53 plays a role in leukemogenesis through a recessive mechanism (two-hit model) of inactivation of tumor suppressor activity",

    "Abstract": "We report a 64-year-old Japanese man with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who expired with myelomonocytic crisis. Cytogenetic analyses of chronic phase (CP) and accelerated phase (AP) cells revealed a Philadelphia chromosome and an isochromosome for the long arm of chromosome 17, i(17q). This karyotype was replaced by another karyotype in blast crisis (BC), resulting in near triploidy with t(5;17) (p15;p11) and loss of chromosome 17 pter-->p11. Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization studies with a chromosome 17 specific alpha satellite DNA probe confirmed the presence of a clonal change in BC. In addition, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and PCR- direct sequencing of BC cells revealed a point mutation at codon 203 of the p53 gene, GTG to GAG (Val to Glu), and loss of the normal allele. In contrast, no alterations of the p53 gene were found in CP and AP cells. Therefore, progression of CML in this patient appeared to be related to loss of 17p, as well as a mutation in the p53 gene",

The investigated material consisted of 20 primary- tumor tissue specimens, obtained by transurethral resection and tissue specimens of 15 lymph-node metastases, obtained at total prostatectomy. The applied methods encompassed immunohistochemistry on frozen sections, using the monoclonal antibody PAb 1801, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, after amplification of single exon sequences by PCR, on exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene. The mutations, leading to aberrantly migrating bands in the PCR-SSCP analysis, were identified by direct sequencing of the PCR product. Immunohistochemical and PCR-SSCP analysis were completely confirmative. In the primary tumors, mutations were found in 10% of the specimens (codons 232 and 273), and in lymph-node metastases in 15% of the specimens (codons 248 and 273). In one case (codon 273), the same mutation was found both in the primary tumor and in the lymph-node metastasis. Our results show that p53 mutations are infrequent in both primary and metastatic prostate tumors. In addition, they indicate that there is no strict correlation between p53 mutation and tumor metastasis",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to characterize the pattern of p53 mutations in bladder cancer. The sensitivity and specificity to detect these mutations using clinical material was assessed for the following assays: immunohistochemistry, restriction-fragment-length polymorphism, single-strand-conformation polymorphism, and sequencing. Discrepancies of reported results aimed at the identification of genetic alterations in the p53 gene may be due to differences in methodology, as well as to deficient morphological evaluation of the source of tissue utilized. In order to address these critical issues, we have implemented a novel experimental design that permits analysis by molecular genetics and immunopathology techniques in any given tissue specimen, allowing morphological correlation with genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of the tissue analyzed. Forty-two patients affected with bladder tumors in whom paired normal and tumor tissues were available were used for the present study. Nuclear immunoreactivities were observed in 26 out of 42 bladder tumors analyzed. Abnormal shifts in mobility were noted in 14 of the 42 cases in distinct exons, with one tumor revealing 3 mutations. There was a strong association between p53 nuclear over- expression and 17p LOH, as well as p53 nuclear over-expression and detection of mutations by SSCP and sequencing. According to receiver- operating-curve statistical analysis, the accuracy of detecting p53 mutations by IHC was estimated to be 90.3%. It is our conclusion that, when properly used, this is a highly sensitive and specific method with simple application using clinical material",

    "Abstract": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has been implicated as a potent growth regulator; the degree of responses to it, whether positive or negative, generally correlates with the stage of cell differentiation in various cell types. We examined the effect of the p53 gene, which participates in the control of cell-cycle progression, on the expression of human TGF-beta. The human glioblastoma cell line SNB-19, which expresses the latent form of TGF-beta, was transfected with a retroviral vector containing wild-type p53 (wt-p53) or p53 with a mutation (mut-p53) at codon 273. Stable G418-resistant SNB-19 clones were isolated. The growth kinetics of wt-p53 transfectants were suppressed compared with those of parental cells, vector transfectants, or mut-p53 transfectants, as assayed by growth-curve measurements and 3H-thymidine incorporation; however, RNA dot blot and Western blot analyses demonstrated that wt-p53 and mut-p53 transfectants expressed higher amounts of TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 mRNA and intracellular TGF- beta isoform proteins, respectively, than parental cells. By means of the biological assay for active TGF-beta (Mv1Lu cell-growth-inhibition assay), we observed that both transfectants produced active TGF-beta, whereas the parental cells produced only the latent form. These results suggest that, while only the wt-p53 gene inhibits tumor-cell progression, both wt-p53 and codon 273-mutated p53 can cause increased TGF-beta expression",

In contrast, in Ki- 1+ ALC lymphomas p53 immunohistochemical reactivity was limited to scattered tumor cells, and no p53-gene alterations could be detected. These results suggest that p53-gene alterations play a role in the lymphomagenetic process of a fraction of HIV-1-related SNC NHLs, however with a frequency no different from that observed in HIV-1- unrelated NHLs of the same sub-type. In HIV-1-related Ki-1+ ALC lymphomas, mechanisms different from gene alterations might be implicated in over-expression of p53 protein",

    "Abstract": "Despite the steadily increasing number of patients suffering from squamous-cell carcinomas of the oropharyngeal region, little is known about the molecular steps involved in the induction of these neoplasms. We investigated oropharyngeal cancers from 38 patients for mutations in the p53 tumour-suppressor gene. The majority of patients (74%) had a history of tobacco and alcohol abuse. Five had lymph-node metastases, 3 had multiple primary carcinomas and 2 presented with multiple primary tumours and lymph-node metastases. Exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene were screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by direct DNA sequencing. A total of 16 tumours (42%) contained point mutations which were scattered throughout exons 5 to 8. Most mutations (56%) were transitions, predominantly G-->A. Among the transversions, G-->T mutations prevailed; these have also been found in smoking-related lung cancer. One carcinoma of the soft palate showed a mutation which was retained in a lymph-node metastasis. In another patient, 2 primary carcinomas had different mutations, indicating that they had developed independently. Similar results were obtained in a case with a p53 mutation in the third of 3 primary tongue carcinomas which developed over a period of 23 years. One lymph-node metastasis had a 12-bp deletion which was not detected in any of the primary malignancies. The frequent occurrence of p53 mutations in oropharyngeal carcinomas supports the view that they play a role in the initiation or progression of the malignant phenotype",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in human tumors with chimeric EWS/FLI-1 genes",
    "Abstract": "The Ewing family of tumors is recurrently characterized at the molecular level by the presence of a fusion transcript between the EWS gene on chromosome 22 and either the FLI-I or ERG genes, 2 closely related members of the Ets family of transcription factors. We have investigated 12 primary human tumors, 11 xenografts and 11 cell lines, which have been shown to express chimeric EWS transcripts in search of p53 mutations. Fragments of exons 5 to 8 and the corresponding consensus splice sequences were amplified by PCR and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). In 12 of 34 samples p53 mutations were detected (including 4 samples with multiple p53 mutations). The distribution of the mutations in the various samples was as follows: primary tumors 2/12; cell lines 5/11; xenografts 5/11. No correlation between the presence or absence of p53 mutations and the presence of a specific EWS chimeric transcript was observed. In addition, we observed that p53 mutations were almost always associated with a second hit (either deletion or second mutation) on the other p53 allele",

    "Abstract": "Two cultured cell lines derived from human squamous-cell carcinomas were established through xenografted tumors in nude mice by 'Geneticin' treatment, which allows to eliminate contaminated mouse fibroblasts and obtain enriched tumor cells at the early stage of cultivation. Line KOSC-2 and KOSC-3 were each derived from a squamous-cell carcinoma of the oral floor and of the lower gingiva, respectively. Both lines grew in a cobblestone pattern, demonstrating their epithelial heritage. Giemsa-banding patterns by chromosome analysis confirmed that both lines are of human origin. Molecular analysis of cancer-related genes, including the Ha-ras, c-myc and p53 genes, was performed. KOSC-3 cells showed co-over-expression of p53 and c-myc mRNA, in addition to p53 point mutation at codon 248 with transition from CGG to TGG. However, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 17 was detected in both lines by Southern blotting. These cell lines provide a model for elucidating the mechanism involving p53 inactivation and c-myc-gene over-expression",

    "Title": "Progressive B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia frequently exhibits aberrant p53 expression",
    "Abstract": "We have analysed the p53 status in non-progressive and progressive chronic B-cell leukemia (B-CLL) by ELISA, immunoprecipitation, FACS and cDNA sequencing in relation to in vitro proliferation in response to Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I (SAC) and IL-2. In FACS, cells from progressive leukaemia were found to over-express p53 with a conformation recognized by PAB240. In a PAb240-based ELISA, 60% of progressive B-CLL were positive. DNA sequencing of p53 exons 5 to 9 revealed a codon 179 His to Gln change in one of the ELISA-positive, progressive B-CLL but failed to reveal any mutations in 4 other ELISA- positive, progressive B-CLL. Among progressive B-CLL populations, 10/14 responded by proliferation in vitro to SAC/IL-2. In non-progressive cells, low levels of p53 were found by FACS, none was positive in the PAb240 ELISA and only one case showed a weak proliferative response to SAC/IL-2. Low p53 expression was also seen in different types of normal B cells, resting and activated, and in EBV-transformed B-cell lines, in contrast to the high expression observed in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines with verified p53 mutations. We conclude that progressive B-CLL is characterized by aberrant p53 expression which may be a significant prognostic factor",

    "Title": "Comparative analysis of mutations in the p53 and K-ras genes in pancreatic cancer",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in codon 12 of K-ras occur in a high proportion of pancreatic cancer cases. Although there is evidence that p53 mutations also occur in this tumor, few studies have been reported to date and no comparison has been made of K-ras and p53 mutations in the same tissues. Single- strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing of the PCR products were used to determine mutations in p53 gene; to detect mutations in K- ras genes, the artificial restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) approach was used. Eight out of 30 tissues from primary pancreas cancer and 3 of 4 samples from metastases showed p53 mutations. Fifteen out of 17 pancreatic cancer cell lines had p53 mutations. In 2 cases, the same p53 mutation was identified in the original tumor and in a tumor-derived cell line. The majority of p53 mutations were present in exons 5-9 of the gene. Mutations at codon 12 of the K-ras gene were identified in 23/32 pancreas cancer tissues and in 14/17 cell lines. There was no relationship between the types of mutation observed in the 2 genes. In conclusion, mutations in K-ras and p53 genes are common in pancreatic cancer. p53 mutations may occur more frequently in metastatic lesions than in primary tumors, although further work is necessary to investigate this point",

    "Abstract": "The pathogenetic significance of p53 and c-Ki-ras gene mutations and genomic integration of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was examined in surgically resected specimens of adenocarcinomas of the uterine cervix and isthmus using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand- conformation polymorphism and Southern blotting analysis. Among 25 cervical adenocarcinomas, p53 gene mutations between exons 5 and 8 were detected in 32%, and the incidence of these mutations was higher in cases at advanced clinical stages and with high grades of nuclear and structural atypia both in endocervical and in endometrioid types. HPV DNA type 16 or 18 in cervical adenocarcinomas was detected in 35% of cases by PCR and in 29% by Southern blotting, and, in contrast to the p53 mutations, the majority of cases with the HPV DNA were at a relatively early clinical stage with low-grade histological atypia. c- Ki-ras gene mutation was detected in only 4% of cervical adenocarcinomas. Among 8 isthmus adenocarcinomas, the incidence of p53 and c-Ki-ras gene mutations, and the presence and integration of HPV DNA type 16 or 18 were 38%, 50%, 57% and 25% respectively. The pattern of p53 mutations differed between isthmus and cervical adenocarcinomas: all of the mutations in the former were one-base substitutions of the transition type, whereas in the latter nearly half of the mutations were of the transversion type. Among cervical adenocarcinomas, p53 mutations between exons 5 and 8 were indicated as being mostly involved in the pathogenesis and development of biologically aggressive tumors, whereas HPV type 16 or 18 infection appeared to be involved in less aggressive cases. In isthmus adenocarcinoma, c-Ki-ras gene mutation, apart from p53 mutation and HPV-type-16 or -18 infection, appeared to be involved frequently in cancer development",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of the tumor-suppressor gene TP53 and amplification of CCND1 gene have been reported to occur frequently in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSQCC). In experimental systems, TP53 mutations have been shown to lead to genomic instability, including an increased propensity for gene amplification. We have examined 16 HNSQCC cell lines for the association between TP53 over-expression/mutation and CCND1 amplification. p53 over-expression was detected in 50% of the cell lines by immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal antibody (MAb) PAb1801. TP53 mutations were also detected in 50% of the cell lines by analysis of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing of exons 4 through 9. Six cell lines showed TP53 mutations and over-expression of the protein, 2 cell lines showed TP53 mutations but no p53 expression, and 2 cell lines showed over-expression of p53 protein but no TP53 gene mutations. CCND1 amplification was found in 38% of the cell lines by Southern blot analysis. Only 1 cell line showed both TP53 mutation and CCND1 amplification, whereas 7 of 8 cell lines with TP53 mutations had no CCND1 amplification. pRb expression was detected by Western blot analysis, and the level of pRb did not correlate with either CCND1 amplification or TP53 mutation. Our findings suggest that TP53 mutation and CCND1 amplification are common genetic alterations in HNSQCC and that the occurrence of either genetic event may be sufficient to abrogate normal cell cycle control",

    "Title": "p53 genetic abnormalities and myc activation in human lung carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "p53 mutations and myc gene amplification and expression were studied in 119 lung carcinomas of all histological types. A mutant p53 immunophenotype was previously found in 47% of these tumors by immunohistochemical analysis. Seven cases exhibited p53 genomic rearrangements on Southern blots. Elevated levels of p53 transcript were found in 12 carcinomas (10%) and decreased levels in 27 carcinomas (23%) on Northern blots. In most of the cases, low levels of transcript were associated with negative immunostaining, whereas elevated levels of mRNA were related to positive immunostaining (mutant immunophenotype). p53 RT/PCR analysis in 10 tumors with absence of transcript on Northern blots revealed only weak or absent expression of normal and/or altered size transcripts. These abnormal transcripts showed deletions, insertions or splicing abnormalities. Taken together, p53 abnormalities were found in 66% of lung carcinomas [52% of neuroendocrine (NE) carcinomas and 75% of NSCLC]. c-myc was found to be activated in 24% (10/42) of these NE and in 48% (33/69) of these NSCLC carcinomas using Southern- and Northern-blot techniques. In addition, L- and N-myc genes were also activated in 26% (10/42) of NE carcinomas. No correlation was found between p53 mutations and myc activation in SCLC or in NSCLC, but their association was significantly more frequent in NSCLC than in SCLC. These results indicate that the p53-positive immunophenotype uncovers the occurrence of p53 point mutations in lung cancer and that p53 and c-myc gene alterations are important but represent independent occurrences in the development of lung tumors",

    "Abstract": "In order to reveal whether differences in the type and site of p53 gene mutations influence the function of the gene and tumor phenotype, we examined nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein immunohistochemically, loss of the other p53 allele by restriction-fragment-length polymorphism analysis, and histological grade of atypia in 52 breast- cancer tissue specimens in which the position and pattern of the mutation were identified. When mis-sense point mutations or deletions of 3n bases (n = 1, 2, ...), which did not cause a frameshift downstream, occurred within codons 110-180 or 234-285, containing highly conserved regions, the p53 protein was almost always (92%) accumulated in nuclei in a majority of the cancer cells. When these mutations occurred outside these regions, only 46% of the cases showed nuclear accumulation of the protein in a majority of cancer cells. In tumors with non-sense point mutations or deletion of 3n + 1 or 3n + 2 bases (n = 0, 1, 2, ...), which caused a downstream frameshift, nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein was absent in 93% of cases. Irrespective of the mutation site or pattern, a majority of cases showing p53 mutation revealed loss of heterozygosity on 17p13 (83%), which suggested they do not carry wild-type p53 allele, and the highest histological grade of atypia (90%). Regardless of differences in their protein-expression pattern, a majority of the p53 gene mutations were suggested to function in a recessive mode and to be involved in the development of histologically aggressive breast cancer",

We examined 16 cases of MPT and 20 cases of 'common' pancreatic duct cell carcinomas (DCC) in regard to K-ras and p53 mutations. The mutations were detected by constant denaturant gel electrophoresis in combination with other techniques using PCR products amplified from the samples microdissected from the tissue sections. K-ras codon 12 mutations were identified in all MPT and in 95% of DCC. On the other hand, p53 mutations were found in four of 20 (20%) DCC, and p53 was immunocytochemically overexpressed in 3 of the 4 mutated cases. However, no p53 mutations and no p53 overexpression were identified in the 16 MPT. These results indicate that, although the K-ras codon 12 mutations may be almost essential for the development of both MPT and DCC, p53 mutations seemed to be involved mainly to the latters",

    "Abstract": "In a total of 26 primary human lung tumors and 60 metastases derived from them, exons 5-8 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene were analyzed by single-strand conformation polymorphism and subsequent direct DNA sequencing of amplified DNA. Mutational inactivation of the p53 gene was identified in four of five squamous cell carcinomas, three of nine adenocarcinomas, and two of nine small-cell carcinomas, the overall incidence being 35%. Point mutations occurred at a similar incidence in exons 5-8, with a preference for G-->T transversions. In seven of nine cases (78%), mutations were identical in the primary tumor and all of its metastases, indicating that in lung tumors, p53 mutations usually precede metastasis and that hematogenic and lymphogenic dissemination of tumor cells to other tissues is not associated with a selection against p53 inactivation. In one case, a kidney metastasis had the same mutation as the primary squamous cell carcinoma, whereas a liver metastasis had no mutation, indicating heterogeneity of the primary lung neoplasm and selective metastasis of mutated and nonmutated tumor cells to kidney and liver, respectively. Only in one liver metastasis was a mutation identified that was neither present in the primary lung tumor nor in a kidney metastasis, suggesting that occasionally p53 mutations occur after metastatic spread",

Two identical missense point mutations, involving codons 249 and 281 and leading to the amino acid substitutions Arg-Ser and Thy-Asp, were identified in cells of an extramedullary mass and then in peripheral blood blast crisis cells. The data indicate that the medullary and extramedullary blast cells belong to the same cellular clone.

To test the hypothesis that mutations in the p53 tumour suppressor gene are involved in these differences, we examiend 131 gastric and 138 colorectal cancers from Hispanic and Anglo patients from South Texas and Mexico using immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a screening assay from p53 mutations.  The fraction of p53 positive cases was not significantly different in gastric cancers from Hispanics compared to Anglos (43% versus 61%, respectively, p = 0.13) or in colorectal cancer (57% versus 58%, respectively, p = 1.0), suggesting that p53 mutations are not involved in causing the different incidences of these cancers in these populations. In addition, the types of p53 mutations arising in gastric tumours from Hispanic patients were consistent with those reported in gastric tumours in other populations.  Sequencing of mutations in five gastric cancers revealed two G:C to A:T transitions, two A:T to G:C transitions and one complex deletion.  In contrast with findings in studies in other tumour types, neither stage nor survival was associated with p53 positive staining by IHC in either gastric or colorectal tumours in this study.  Postiive p53 immunostaining was associated with the diffuse histological subtype in gastric carcinoma (p = 0.05) and high histological grade in colorectal carcinoma (p = 0.04).",

    "Abstract": "In order to determine whether or not the p53 gene is involved in the malignant transformation of the head and neck carcinoma HNSCC, we have analyzed archival specimens from 527 primary head and neck lesions and 27 corresponding lymph node metastases. Nuclear p53 protein was present in 107 of 190 (56%) dysplasias, 61 of 102 (60%) carcinoma in situ (CIS), and 262 of 493 (53%) carcinomas. The p53 score did not increase significantly with progression of these lesions from dysplasia to CIS and to carcinoma. All 357 normal samples of head and neck tissues were negative. The majority of the 172 sets of premalignant and malignant lesions displayed concordant p53 staining patterns. The staining was incongruous in only six cases. The p53 staining results were congruent in all 27 pairs of primary and metastatic (lymph nodes) tumors. These data strongly suggest that p53 protein could be altered in a very early phase of the head and neck tumorigenesis and is maintained during tumor progression and metastatic spread. Mutations in p53 were examined in 11 cases that exhibited high levels of p53 protein as detected by immunohistochemistry using PAb 1801 MAb. Mutation analysis was performed by direct sequencing of the PCR amplification products of exons 5 through 8, which contain greater than 90% of p53 mutations found in tumors. Three of 11 HNSCC had mutations at codon 130 (C to A), 193 (A to T), 283 (G to C), respectively. No mutations were found in the other 8 samples within the regions examined. However, they may have mutations in unsequenced regions of p53 or may have wild type protein that accumulates for other reasons",

    "Title": "Characterization of p53 gene mutations in colorectal carcinomas from an Asian population",
    "Abstract": "A series of colorectal carcinomas from an Asian population in Singapore were analyzed for mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53. Based on single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and direct DNA sequencing, 15 of 38 tumors (39%) were found to contain mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene. The point mutations were predominantly base transitions. Among the 10 transitions, 5 were at CpG dinucleotide sites. One-third (5/15) of the mutations were found at previously identified hotspot codons 175, 248 and 282. In one case, an insertion of a 6-base pair sequence was found. p53 mutations did not correlate with tumor histological grade, Dukes' stage, or metastases. However, tumors at the distal site showed a higher proportion of mutations than the proximal site. Further, no mutation was found in the normal mucosa adjacent to tumor site, suggesting that no germ-line mutations were present. The results were compared with those from other studies and are discussed in connection to possible etiological factors that are specific to the local population",

    "Title": "The role of the p53 gene in the malignant transformation of pleomorphic adenomas of the parotid gland",
    "Abstract": "Pleomorphic adenoma (PA), the most common neoplasm of the parotid gland in adults, undergoes malignant transformation in only two to six percent of cases. In order to determine whether or not the p53 gene is involved in the malignant transformation of PA of the parotid gland, we have analyzed archival specimens from four patients with carcinoma ex- pleomorphic adenoma (CEPA) by immunohistochemistry and sequencing of the amplified DNA. Tissue specimens from each patient contained both the CEPA and the precursor PA. Immunostaining revealed that while all CEPA were p53 positive, only one of the four precursor PA was positive for p53. In this case, DNA was isolated from both the PA and CEPA and exons five through eight were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. The same p53 mutation (single base substitution) was found in both the PA and the CEPA at codon 248. Adjacent normal tissue contained the wild-type p53 sequence. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the same p53 point mutation in both a PA and the associated CEPA of the parotid. These results strongly suggest a role for p53 gene mutation in the malignant transformation of some PA of the parotid gland",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are commonly found in the major human cancers and the mutational spectrum in some cancer types is consistent with the genotoxic effects of the associated environmental risk factors. Thus far there is little information on p53 mutations in cancers of factory workers with a history of carcinogen exposure in the workplace. Occupational exposure to vinyl chloride causes liver angiosarcomas (ASL) and also increases the risk of several other cancers. Loss of p53 function in osteo- and fibrosarcomas can occur by two different mechanisms, p53 mutation and amplification of the MDM2 gene. We examined tumors from five vinyl chloride-exposed patients, four with ASL and one with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for evidence of MDM2 proto-oncogene amplification or p53 mutation in exons 5-8. Amplification of MDM2 was not found, but in two of the angiosarcomas an A:T to T:A missense mutation was detected. p53 sequence analysis of vinyl chloride associated cancers may provide valuable information on the relationship between carcinogen exposure and DNA damage in cancer- related genes",

    "Abstract": "A 45 base pair (bp) intragenic deletion of the p53 gene from a human esophageal cancer was analyzed in detail. This deletion contained all RNA splice consensus sequences at the 3' end of intron 7, including the RNA splice branch point, the pyrimidine-rich region and the 3' splice acceptor site. Northern blotting revealed a total lack of p53 mRNA expression in this tumor. Short direct repeats (TACTG) were found at the 5' and 3' breakpoints of the deletion and it removed one complete repeat as well as the entire region between the repeats. These results suggest that a 'slipped mispairing' mechanism occurring during DNA replication may generate p53 intragenic deletion in human esophageal cancer, leading to abolished p53 mRNA expression",

    "Abstract": "An elevated risk of bladder cancer has been reported in the endemic region of 'black foot disease' on the southwest coast of Taiwan and may be related to high arsenic levels in artesian well water. Thirteen urothelial tumors from this endemic region were examined for mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene to identify the effects of possible exogenous factors at the DNA level. DNA was extracted from archival tissue after microdissection of tumors and analyzed by PCR-SSCP (polymerase chain reaction-based single strand conformation polymorphism), followed by direct sequencing. Eight cases (62%) showed mutations and 9 of the 10 point mutations observed were transitions. The type and position of the mutations were not significantly different when compared with the spectra of p53 mutations previously reported for transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs). However, two of the mutations were CGC-->CAC base changes at codon 175, a mutational hotspot for many tumor types but previously unreported in TCCs except in cases associated with inflammatory agents. Three of the tumors examined were found to contain double mutations, a relatively rare mutagenic event in human cancers. Our results suggest that the agents responsible for the high risk of bladder cancer in the black foot disease region may operate through an inflammation-based mechanism which increases the amount of DNA damage per mutagenic event",

Only one case of hydatidiform mole was found to have a missense point mutation (codon 295, CCT-->CTT, i.e. proline to leucine) of the p53 gene.

    "Title": "Tumor cell-specific loss of p53 protein in a unique in vitro model of human breast tumor progression",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 gene are the most frequent genetic lesion in breast cancer. Here, we examined p53 expression in a unique in vitro model of tumor progression derived from a single breast cancer patient (21T series). While the normal mammary epithelial, fibroblast and mesothelial cells derived from this patient expressed easily detectable functional p53 protein, the primary as well as metastatic tumor cell lines demonstrated a lack of p53 protein synthesis. 21T tumor cells failed to exhibit G1 cell cycle arrest upon exposure to gamma- irradiation, and their growth was suppressed by transfection of a normal p53 cDNA, demonstrating a lack of p53-mediated function in these cells. No p53 gene deletion or rearrangements were detectable. PCR and sequence analysis of the entire coding region of p53 gene revealed a novel mutation, an insertion of a single T within codon 33, which resulted in a frame-shift and early termination. The same mutation was observed in all 21T tumor cell lines. These results demonstrate a tumor cell-specific loss of p53 protein due to a frame-shift mutation, and suggest that p53 loss may occur at a relatively early step in breast tumorigenesis before metastatic seeding or emergence of tumor heterogeneity. In addition, the availability of normal and tumor- derived epithelial cells with known p53 sequences from a single breast cancer patient should facilitate understanding of the p53 regulation in mammary cells",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in lung cancers from Japanese mustard gas workers",
    "Abstract": "Mustard gas (MG) is a mutagenic and carcinogenic alkylating agent, and is a known risk factor for occupational lung cancer. Our hypothesis is that lung cancers from MG workers contain mutations (G:C to A:T transitions) as the result of MG-produced DNA promutagenic adducts in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. We analyzed 12 primary lung cancers from Japanese MG factory workers and 12 lung cancers from non-exposed individuals. Genomic DNA was isolated from archival paraffin-embedded tissues. Exons 5-8 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using p53-specific primers, and sequenced by dideoxy termination methods. Six out of 12 lung cancers from MG workers contained a total of eight somatic point mutations: two cases had double G:C to A:T transitions; one had a G:C to T:A transversion; one case had an A:T to G:C transition; and two cases had single base deletions. Four of the six mutated purines occurred on the non-transcribed, DNA-coding strand. Out of 12 unexposed cases, there were six single base mutations in six cancers, and no double mutations. The p53 mutational frequency in the MG-exposed cases is similar to the non-exposed controls and the usual smoking-related lung cancers reported previously. However, the distinctive double mutations (G:C to A:T transition) observed in two cases are unusual and may be related to MG exposure",

From 40 patient samples, 15 showed an extra band in SSCP. In 13 samples mutations were detected in exons 5-8. They constituted six transitions and seven transversions, four of them being T to A transversions. Mutations in codons 205 and 248 occurred in two and in codon 246 in three samples. Larynx cancer is strongly associated with tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. The typical p53 mutations in lung cancer, G to T transversions and G to A and C to T transitions, associated with smoking, accounted for 46% of the mutations detected. Fifty-four per cent of the mutations were detected in a reported hotspot region covering codons 238-248",

    "Title": "Mutation and overexpression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene frequently occurs in uterine and ovarian sarcomas",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of mutation and overexpression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in female genital tract sarcomas. METHODS: Immunostaining for p53 was performed in frozen sections of 46 ovarian and uterine sarcomas. Single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 4-9 of the p53 gene was performed in 33 sarcomas. We performed DNA sequencing of the p53 gene in 22 cases in which we found p53 protein overexpression and/or shifted bands on single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: Overexpression of p53 was seen in 27 of 46 sarcomas (59%), including 26 of 41 (63%) mixed mesodermal tumors, one of four (25%) leiomyosarcomas, and zero of one endometrial stromal sarcoma. Among the 33 sarcomas subjected to molecular analysis, 21 demonstrated mutations in the p53 gene (64%). Eighteen cancers had a single mutation, whereas three cases showed two mutations in the p53 gene. There was one mutation in exon 4, seven mutations in exon 5, three mutations in exon 6, six mutations in exon 7, six mutations in exon 8, and one mutation in exon 9. With the exception of one microdeletion, which predicted a truncated protein product, all of the mutations were missense point mutations. All but one of the point mutations resulted in changes in the predicted amino acid sequence. There were 18 transition mutations (75%), five transversions (21%), and one deletion (4%). CONCLUSIONS: Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, with resultant overexpression of p53 protein, frequently occurs in ovarian and uterine sarcomas. Because most of the mutations are transitions, p53 mutations in these cancers likely arise from spontaneous errors in DNA synthesis and repair rather than from exposure to carcinogens",

Of interest, 1 of 7 endometrial cancers with concomitant atypical hyperplasia showed weak nuclear staining in a few atypical hyperplastic glands in addition to the cancerous lesions. Although staining was associated with cancers having a high histologic grade and serous papillary adenocarcinomas of the endometrium, it did not correlate with invasion, metastasis, or clinical stage. Comparison of the staining patterns with molecular analysis of mutations in the p53 gene showed the expected correlation of nuclear staining with missense mutations but not with nonsense mutations, which consistuted one third of all mutations found in this series. In addition, cytoplasmic staining did not predict mutation",

However, studies on the p53 gene have been limited by the need for frozen tissues. We have developed a method utilizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the direct analysis of p53 mutation by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and by direct DNA sequencing of the p53 gene using a single 10-microns paraffin-embedded tissue section. We applied this method to screen for p53 gene mutations in exons 5-8 in human gliomas utilizing paraffin- embedded tissues. Twenty paraffin blocks containing tumor were selected from surgical specimens from 17 different adult patients. Tumors included six anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs), nine glioblastomas (GBs), and two mixed malignant gliomas (MMGs). The tissue section on the stained glass slide was used to guide microdissection of an unstained adjacent tissue section to ensure > 90% of the tumor cell population for p53 mutational analysis. Simultaneously, microdissection of the tissue was also carried out to obtain normal tissue from adjacent areas as a control. Mutations in the p53 gene were identified in 3 of 17 (18%) patients by PCR-SSCP analysis and subsequently confirmed by PCR- based DNA sequencing. Mutations in exon 5 resulting in amino acid substitution were found in one thalamic AA (codon 158, CGC > CTT: Arg > Leu) and one cerebral hemispheric GB (codon 151, CCG > CTG: Pro > Leu).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This study aimed to determine the stage in which p53 mutations arise in neoplastic progression in Barrett's esophagus and their relationship to the clonal evolution of cancer. METHODS: Fourteen patients with high-grade dysplasia, adenocarcinoma, or both arising in Barrett's esophagus were evaluated. Flow cytometric cell sorting was used to obtain purified populations of neoplastic cells for analysis of p53 mutations. DNA was extracted, and exons 5 through 9 of the p53 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Amplified DNA was sequenced and analyzed by automated sequencing. RESULTS: Nine of the 14 patients had p53 mutations. Six of the 9 patients had regions of high-grade dysplasia that could be evaluated; all 6 had p53 mutations in high-grade dysplasia. In 3 patients, the same p53 mutations were found in both high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. All 14 patients had aneuploidy. In 4 patients, diploid cell populations could also be evaluated for p53 mutations; 3 of the 4 patients had p53 mutations in diploid cell populations. In 2 patients, the same p53 mutation was found in multiple aneuploid cell populations within a cancer. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations occur frequently in Barrett's adenocarcinomas.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: The pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer is poorly understood. The multigenetic nature of carcinogenesis has been best documented in colon cancer. The relevance of this model was suggested for other epithelial tumors. Only advanced stages of pancreatic cancer are usually detected because of late diagnosis. Analysis of accumulated, diverse genetic changes could allow further understanding of putative mechanisms involved in tumor development. Activated c-Ki- ras oncogene has been shown to be a frequent event. However, additional alterations of tumor suppressor genes are expected. Therefore, concomitant genetic changes of p53 and deleted in colon carcinoma (DCC) in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines and primary tumors were analyzed. METHODS: p53 protein and transcript expression were revealed by immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry, immunoassay, and Northern blot analysis. p53 mutations were identified by sequence analysis. DCC expression was investigated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: p53 overexpression was observed in 9 of 12 cell lines. p53 point mutations were confirmed in seven cell lines overexpressing p53. The majority of cell lines showed concomitant p53 and DCC alterations. Four of 6 primary tumors overexpressing p53 also showed loss of DCC expression. CONCLUSIONS: p53 and DCC genetic changes are associated with pancreatic cancer and the frequently activated c-Ki- ras oncogene. Therefore, the multihit model of carcinogenesis could prove relevant for pancreatic cancer",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: In long-term extensive ulcerative colitis, aneuploidy occurs earlier and loss of heterozygosity for p53 (p53 LOH) later during histological progression towards carcinoma. This study determined the time of onset of p53 mutation in this progression. METHODS: We developed a rapid, sensitive screening assay for p53 mutations at codon 248. The geographic distribution of this p53 mutation was mapped in two fresh colectomy specimens with mutations of codon 248 (1 cancer, 1 dysplasia) and correlated with patterns of clonal expansion, histological progression, and allelic loss. Numerous samples from throughout both colons were analyzed (216 for histology, 142 for DNA content, 104 for mutation, and 41 for p53 LOH). RESULTS: p53 mutation correlated highly with histological grade and was distributed more extensively than p53 LOH. Mutation, but not LOH, was also found in diploid, nondysplastic colonic mucosa adjacent to dysplastic areas. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that p53 mutation appears to be an early genetic event that precedes p53 LOH. The very close correlation of p53 mutation with aneuploidy (P > 0.0001) emphasizes the role of normal p53 at the G1 checkpoint to help prevent entry of genetically damaged cells into the cell cycle",

RESULTS: Numerous genetic alterations were identified in each of the dysplasias and carcinomas profiled. These genetic alterations involved many of the same targets found in sporadic colorectal tumors and included multiple sites of allelic deletion, microsatellite instabilities, and mutations of the K- ras, p53, and APC genes. The progression of dysplasia to carcinoma was often accompanied by an accumulation of these mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic alterations are common in colitis-associated neoplasia, just as in sporadic colorectal neoplasia.

    "Title": "Association of p53 mutations with short survival in colorectal cancer",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Mutations in p53, a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 17p, are the most frequent genetic alterations found in human cancers. Increased intracellular concentration of p53, which is frequently but not systematically related to p53 mutation, has been proposed to be associated with poor prognosis in some tumor types. In colorectal cancer, this significance is still a matter of debate. To directly investigate the relationship between prognosis and p53 mutation, this study screened a series of 85 colorectal carcinomas for mutations in exons 5-8 of this gene. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction- amplified products from tumor DNA were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Forty-four tumors were found to be mutated (52%). A strong correlation between the presence of a mutation and short survival was observed (P = 0.003). When tumors were classified according to their histological stage, a multivariate Cox model analysis showed that p53 mutation, rather than 17p allelic loss (previously proposed to convey prognostic information), was retained as the only independent prognostic factor (relative risk, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-4.80; P < 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Combined with staging, direct monitoring of p53 mutation improves prognostic accuracy for colorectal cancer",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations in human prostate cancers in Japan: different mutation spectra between Japan and western countries",
    "Abstract": "The involvement of p53 mutations in prostate cancers in Japan was investigated. To evaluate any possible clinicopathological significance, p53 mutations in 40 samples from 36 Japanese prostate cancers of different stages (five cases of latent tumors, three of stage A cancers, 10 of stage B, five of stage C and 13 of stage D), including four lymph node metastases of stage D cases, were examined by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR- SSCP) analysis and sequencing. Mutations were detected in five of 40 samples (12.5%); four were in primary cancers and the other in a lymph node metastasis from one of them. All mutation-positive cases were in stage D, and the mutation frequency in stage D cases was 31%. This result indicates that p53 mutations may play a role in the progression of a subgroup of prostate cancers in Japanese, as observed for Americans and Europeans. However, a difference was noted between Japanese and Americans in the p53 mutational spectrum (at CpG site), presumably arising from variation in the underlying etiologic factors",

    "Title": "K-ras and p53 alterations in genomic DNA and transcripts of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "We analyzed 15 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines for alterations of the K-ras and the p53 genes and their transcripts. In 11 cell lines (73.3%), point mutations of the K-ras gene were found at codon 12 in exon 1. In 9 cell lines one allele was mutated and the other was wild type, and both the alleles were expressed into mRNA. In one cell line both alleles of codon 12 were mutated to TGT and GTT, respectively, but only TGT was transcribed into mRNA. Alterations in mRNA of the p53 gene were detected in 10 cell lines (66.7%). Analysis of the genomic sequence of the p53 gene revealed that the alterations consisted of 6 cases of base pair substitutions and 1 case of 1-bp deletion in evolutionarily conserved exons 5 to 8, 2 cases of splicing mutations in exon 4, and 1 case of novel deletion from exons 2 to 9. In 14 cell lines (93.3%), alterations were identified in the K-ras or p53 gene. Of these, 4 cell lines harbored K-ras mutations without p53 alteration, whereas 3 cell lines exhibited p53 alterations without K- ras mutation. Thus, it is suggested that activation of the K-ras gene and inactivation of the p53 gene are strongly and cooperatively associated with pancreatic carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "High frequency of p53 abnormality in laryngeal cancers of heavy smokers and its relation to human papillomavirus infection",
    "Abstract": "A series of 41 laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas was examined for p53 abnormalities and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection by an immunohistochemical and/or molecular approach. Immunohistochemically, p53 over-expression was observed in about 60% of the cancers, of which 12 were revealed to contain point mutations of p53 by a combination of the single-strand conformational polymorphism technique and direct sequencing. The p53 point mutations ranged from codons 157 to 278 and most of these mutations lay in two 'hot spots' (codon 157 in four cancers and codon 248 in three cancers). The majority of p53 mutations, both transversions (seven cancers) and transitions (five cancers), occurred at the G nucleotide of the codons. An analysis of the clinical information indicated that p53 point mutation was frequently observed in heavy smokers with an average Brinkman index score of more than 1000. On the other hand, HPV DNA, type 16 or 18, was detected in a quarter of the laryngeal cancers. Of eleven HPV-positive cases, nine were immunohistochemically positive for p53, of which four contained a p53 point mutation. These results suggested no inverse relation between p53 mutation and HPV infection in laryngeal cancers. Our study indicates that p53 abnormalities are related to smoking history and the correlation might be better for smoking and chemical mutagenesis than for HPV",

    "Title": "Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein correlates with mutations in the p53 gene on archival paraffin-embedded tissues of human breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "Fifty invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing after microdissection of conventional formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. A highly significant association between the presence of p53 gene mutation and nuclear accumulation of p53 protein was found (P < 0.0001). Of 13 tumors that demonstrated p53 gene mutations, 11 (84.6%) showed nuclear accumulation of p53 protein. However, of 37 tumors in which gene mutations were not detected, only 5 (13.5%) showed nuclear accumulation of p53 protein. There was a statistically significant association between the nuclear accumulation of p53 protein and a higher histological grade (P < 0.001) or mitotic index (P < 0.01). In addition, gene mutations had a statistically significant association with a higher histological grade (P < 0.05) or mitotic index (P < 0.0001). Therefore, p53 abnormalities might be associated with an aggressive phenotype in breast cancer. We conclude that the immunohistochemical detection of nuclear p53 protein accumulation is highly associated with p53 gene mutations in archival paraffin-embedded tissues, and that this method is useful for rapid screening of p53 abnormalities",

    "Title": "Alteration of the p53 tumor suppressor gene occurs independently of K- ras activation and more frequently in serous adenocarcinomas than in other common epithelial tumors of the human ovary",
    "Abstract": "To clarify the role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in the development of human ovarian epithelial tumors and to study the association of p53 alterations with K-ras activation, a series of 70 common epithelial ovarian tumors from Japanese patients was studied. These included 31 serous adenocarcinomas, 12 mucinous adenocarcinomas, 5 mucinous tumors of borderline malignancy, 13 endometrioid adenocarcinomas, and 9 clear cell carcinomas. Allelic loss, recognized at the polymorphic site in codon 72 of the p53 gene, was detected in 14 of 36 (39%) informative cases by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA fragments. Mutations in the highly conserved regions of the p53 gene were detected by SSCP analysis of PCR- amplified fragments. Mutations were found in 22 of 70 (31%) ovarian tumors, including 1 of 5 mucinous tumors of borderline malignancy. Mutations were subsequently characterized by direct sequencing. Single missense base substitutions were detected in 13 ovarian carcinomas and in one case of mucinous tumor of borderline malignancy. Short (1-8 bp) deletions and insertions were found in 8 cases. Mutations in the p53 gene occurred more frequently in serous adenocarcinomas (14/31, 45%) than in all nonserous types of malignant epithelial tumors combined (7/34, 21%; P = 0.032). Point mutations in K-ras were identified by dot blot hybridization analysis of PCR-amplified fragments with mutation- specific oligonucleotides and by direct sequencing. The overall frequency of K-ras mutations was 19/70 (27%). K-ras mutations were found in 12 of 17 (71%) mucinous tumors (8/12 mucinous carcinomas [67%] and 4/5 mucinous tumors of borderline malignancy [80%]), and occurred more frequently than in serous carcinomas (4/31, 13%; P = 0.00009) or in all nonmucinous types of ovarian epithelial tumors combined (7/53, 13%; P = 0.00002). These data suggest that different combinations of oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes may be involved in the genesis and development of histologically distinct categories of common epithelial tumors of the human ovary",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the prognostic significance of p53 gene abnormalities and ras gene mutations in patients with curatively resected stage I lung adenocarcinoma. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues were obtained from 30 patients who had undergone curative resection for stage I lung adenocarcinoma. Abnormalities of the p53 gene were detected using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis and immunohistochemistry and ras mutations were detected using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the relationship between the presence of abnormalities of these genes and the patients' disease-free survival. Eleven tumors (37%) had mutated p53 sequences and 11 (37%) showed p53 overexpression. A total of 15 tumors (50%) had p53 gene abnormalities and the concordance rate was 73%. Seven tumors (23%) showed mutated ras sequences. The univariate analysis revealed that the disease-free survival of patients with any p53 abnormality was shorter than that of those without abnormalities (P = 0.02, generalized Wilcoxon test), and survival of those with p53 protein overexpression was more significantly shorter (P = 0.003, generalized Wilcoxon test). Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model indicated that the presence of p53 abnormalities was a significantly (P = 0.01) unfavorable prognostic factor. There was no significant correlation between the presence of ras mutation and survival. These results suggest that analysis of the p53 gene may be helpful for the selection of high-risk patients for clinical trials of adjuvant therapy for stage I lung adenocarcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of exons 3 through 9 of the p53 gene in skin lesions were screened in 23 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 25 cases of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), two cases of Bowen's disease, 10 cases of solar keratosis, and five cases of keratoacanthoma by polymerase chain reaction--single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Mutations of the p53 gene were detected in seven of 23 SCCs (30%), three of 25 BCCs (12%), and none in all cases of Bowen's disease, solar keratosis, or keratoacanthoma. Of 23 cases of SCC, mutations were detected in four of 15 SCCs (27%) that originated in the sunlight-exposed skin region, in two of three SCCs (67%) that originated in the scar tissue, and in one of three SCCs (33%) that originated in radiation dermatitis. Mutations of C-->T transition predominated in SCC and BCC that originated in the sunlight-exposed skin region. Mutations of C-->A or CC-->AT observed in tumors that originated in the predisposed conditions, presumably unrelated to UV light, are different from those found in UV light-related SCC or BCC. Twelve cases of SCC were comparatively analyzed with the immunohistochemical staining with anti- p53 antibody. Two of four cases with positive staining had missense mutations, and three of eight cases with negative staining had nonsense mutations. Based on these findings, immunohistochemical results do not necessarily mean the presence or absence of p53 gene mutations in skin tumors, and sequence analysis is essential for determining whether the gene is mutated",

In a series of Japanese patients, eight of 27 cases (30%) of solar keratosis showed structural abnormalities of the p53 gene. Six of eight aberrations of p53 gene were determined to be single nucleotide substitutions, and five of these were located at a dipyrimidine site. In solar keratosis, noticeable mutations were C to T in three cases, and one each of C to A and T to C nucleotide changes. p53 protein was detected immunohistochemically in the nuclei of six of 27 cases (22%) of solar keratosis. Nuclear staining for p53 protein was only significantly correlated with the presence of missense mutation of p53 gene (p < 0.01). Aberrations of the p53 gene in solar keratosis may be a marker to predict early cancerous lesions",

    "Title": "p53 mutation, expression, and DNA ploidy in evolving gliomas: evidence for two pathways of progression",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Two lines of evidence indirectly implicate the tumor suppressor p53 (also known as TP53) gene in glioma development. First, germline mutations of the p53 gene are associated with increased susceptibility to glioma. Second, chromosome 17p deletions and p53 gene mutations are found frequently in sporadic gliomas of all malignancy stages. These observations suggest that mutations of the p53 gene may be early events in glioma development. PURPOSE: Our purpose was to analyze 15 low-grade astrocytic gliomas that progressed to higher-grade gliomas, examining the status of the p53 gene in both the initial and recurrent tumors. Also, we explored the relationships between p53 status, DNA ploidy, tumor grade, and patient survival. METHODS: Fifteen low-grade gliomas that recurred as tumors of higher grade 17-102 months after initial treatment (biopsy, resection, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy) were identified from hospital records of patients (eight male and seven female) aged 31-68 years. Pathologic diagnosis was re- evaluated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing were performed on tissue samples from the initial and recurrent tumors of each patient, using oligonucleotide PCR primers directed to exons 5-9 of the p53 gene. p53 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and DNA ploidy evaluated by DNA flow cytometry. RESULTS: Eight (53%) of fifteen tumors had p53 mutations in exons 5-9. Nine (64%) of fourteen were immunopositive initially, and eight of these were also immunopositive at recurrence. p53 gene status was significantly associated with p53 expression in the initial tumor (P = .02), and p53 expression at initial diagnosis was significantly related to tumor pathology at recurrence (P = .03). Patients with p53 mutant tumors survived nearly twice as long as those without mutations (median survival, 61 versus 33 months; P = .031). There was no significant difference in recurrence-free survival between patients with p53 mutant and nonmutant tumors (48 versus 33 months; P = .37), but there was a significant difference in postrecurrence survival (17 versus 2 months; P = .019). CONCLUSION: Low-grade tumors that recurred as anaplastic gliomas were characterized by p53 gene mutation, immunopositivity, and DNA non-diploidy. Low-grade tumors that recurred as glioblastomas generally had intact p53 genes and were immunonegative. These findings suggest that histologically indistinguishable, low-grade astrocytic gliomas that are destined to progress to higher grades, do so along two distinct clinicopathologic pathways (either stepwise to anaplastic glioma, then glioblastoma, or directly to glioblastoma) marked by the presence or absence of p53 mutation",

    "Title": "p53 in prostate cancer: frequent expressed transition mutations",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Carcinoma of the prostate is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in men. Little is known about the pathogenesis of this disease and the molecular genetic events that contribute to its development. Molecular studies have begun to reveal biologic characteristics of this disease, notably, the loss of genetic material as determined by studies of restriction fragment length polymorphism, oncogene activation, and production and response to growth factors. PURPOSE: Our goal was to characterize p53 gene mutations in human carcinoma of the prostate and to analyze base-pair changes within the coding regions of p53 mRNA (exons 4 through 11). METHODS: Forty-four prostate tissue specimens and four metastatic lesions were obtained from 48 prostate carcinoma patients who had surgical resection. RNA was either immediately extracted or the specimens were snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -70 degrees C until used. Total RNA was extracted from tumor specimens. Expression of p53 was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of mRNA (RNA/PCR). Following confirmation of the RNA/PCR products by Southern blotting, quantitation of message levels was performed by laser densitometry. Absolute area integrations of the curves representing each tissue were then compared after adjustment for the housekeeping gene c-N-ras. Two overlapping regions (exons 4-6 and 6-11) were examined by a nonisotopic PCR single- strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis system. All specimens displaying SSCP abnormalities were sequenced in both directions to confirm the findings. RESULTS: Of the 48 prostate specimens, three (6%) (two primary and one metastatic) displayed nearly undetectable expression of p53 mRNA (samples PS-70, L113, and PS-95) and 17 (35%) of 48 expressed mutant p53 mRNA encoding amino acid substitutions within exons 4-11 (14 of 17) and/or deletions within the p53 transcripts (three of 17). Overall, the frequency of p53 gene abnormalities that would result in altered protein expression was 20 (42%) of 48 in the tissue samples from prostate carcinoma patients. Nucleotide base-pair transitions of A-->G or T-->C were the most frequent. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations are common in prostate cancer. The patterns of p53 gene mutations are dramatically different from data obtained on other cancers and indicate the possible involvement of a carcinogenic agent(s). IMPLICATIONS: Further studies are required to determine the biologic role of p53 gene alterations in the development and progression of this disease and to determine whether p53 mutations can be useful as prognostic markers or for the selection of better treatments for prostate cancer patients",

    "Title": "Altered patterns of MDM2 and TP53 expression in human bladder cancer",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The TP53 gene maps to the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p13.1) and encodes for a nuclear phosphoprotein of 53 kd (p53) involved in cell cycle control. The MDM2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q13-14), and it encodes for a nuclear protein (Mdm2) of 90 kd of molecular mass. Genetic alterations in the TP53 gene have been reported as frequent events in bladder cancer and are associated with disease progression. The MDM2 gene has been shown to be amplified and overexpressed in sarcomas; however, these changes have not yet been analyzed in neoplastic lesions of the urinary bladder. PURPOSE: We undertook the present study in order to determine the frequency of MDM2 and TP53 abnormalities in bladder tumors, as well as to examine the clinical relevance of identifying their altered patterns of expression in patients affected with bladder cancer. METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of 87 patients affected by bladder tumors. Altered patterns of expression of Mdm2 proteins were determined using an immunohistochemical assay with monoclonal antibody 2A10, and MDM2 gene amplifications were studied by Southern blotting. Mutant p53 proteins were identified using monoclonal antibody PAb1801. The presence of intragenic mutations in the TP53 gene were assessed utilizing single- strand conformation polymorphism and further characterized by sequencing. Associations were assessed statistically by the two-tailed Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Twenty-six of 87 cases had abnormally high levels of Mdm2 proteins; however, only one case showed an MDM2 amplification. Thirty-six of 87 cases displayed p53 nuclear overexpression. Sixteen cases had abnormally high levels of both Mdm2 and p53 proteins. There was a strong statistical association between Mdm2 and p53 overexpression (Fisher's exact test: P = .018). Moreover, there was a striking association between Mdm2 overexpression and low- stage, low-grade bladder tumors (Fisher's exact test: P = .0005). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that aberrant Mdm2 and p53 phenotypes are frequent events in bladder cancer and may be involved in tumorigenesis or tumor progression in urothelial neoplasias. IMPLICATIONS: This study is the first to report altered patterns of MDM2 expression in human bladder tumors and demonstrates that aberrant Mdm2 and p53 phenotypes may be important diagnostic and prognostic markers in patients affected by bladder cancer",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in human bladder cancer",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 play an important role in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. To assess the status of p53 from genomic DNA from bladder cancer samples a two stage polymerase chain reaction was employed. The technique provided material for subsequent detection of mutations by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis followed by DNA sequence analysis. SSCP analysis of exons 5 to 9 of p53 was performed using fragments from PCR end-labeled with 32P followed by autoradiography using an electrophoresis system with temperature control. This SSCP method improved resolution of mutations in exons 5, 7, and 8 and the sharpness of bands in exons 6 and 9. Bands with altered migration patterns were excised from the dried SSCP gels, reamplified by PCR, and sequenced. Mutations in conserved exons 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of the p53 gene were analyzed from bladder tumor biopsies. Our results are consistent with the literature in that mutations in p53 are predominantly found in high grade bladder cancer (Odds Ratio = 4.05, Fisher Exact P = 0.104); however, the results were not statistically significant due to small numbers. Eight of 35 (23%) tumor samples examined showed mutations in p53 (including two double mutations). Six of 13 (46%) grade III and IV tumors had p53 mutations vs. 2 of 17 (12%) grade I and II tumors. Normal individuals carried no p53 mutations. We found no correlation between pack years of smoking and mutation in p53. The spectrum of mutations confirmed a high proportion of G:C C:G transversions as well as the occurrence of double mutations",

    "Abstract": "We have looked for LOH, mutation, and expression of p53 in a series of 56 primary gastric carcinomas, using Southern blotting, constant denaturant gel electrophoresis (CDGE), direct sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. Two hundred-four lymph node metastases from 36 of these cases were also studied by immunohistochemistry. Loss of constitutional heterozygosity for the p53 locus was detected in five of 16 informative cases; in four of these cases there was a concurrent point mutation at the retained allele. Immunoreactivity for p53 product and mutation of p53 were observed in nine and 10 of the 56 tumors, respectively. There was no significant relationship between p53 immunoreactivity or mutation and pathologic features. The overall prevalence of p53 mutations, as detected by CDGE, was 18%. Direct sequencing confirmed p53 mutations (all G:C-A:T transitions) in seven cases, six of which were missense mutations; the remaining case was a silent mutation. In three of the cases with missense mutations, these occurred at CpG dinucleotides (codons 175, 273, and 282). Three cases with immunoreactivity for p53 product in the primary tumor also showed positive staining in the metastases. In two of these cases (with six and nine metastases, respectively) a positive staining was observed in all lymph node metastases, whereas in the remaining case only two of four nodal metastases were positively stained.

    "Title": "p53 mutations and microsatellite analysis of loss of heterozygosity in malignant gliomas",
    "Abstract": "We have studied alterations of the p53 gene in 27 patients with malignant gliomas. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was investigated by microsatellite analysis in 23 patients (22 informative) and detected in nine. Exons 5 through 9 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in these nine patients: alterations were found in five cases (three missense mutations, one non-sense mutation, and one putative deletion), while in four the DNA sequence was normal. In the four patients where LOH could not be studied, the p53 sequence from tumor DNA was normal. These results indicate that microsatellite analysis is a convenient tool for LOH detection at the p53 locus and that mutations of the p53 gene are present in only part of the patients with LOH, implying the possibility that another tumor suppressor gene is located in the proximity of the p53 locus",

We tested 43 sarcomas for c-myc amplification by Southern blot and molecular hybridization techniques and TP53 mutations by the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) technique and direct sequencing of the PCR products. We found eight tumors with c-myc amplification and five different tumors with TP53 mutations but no tumors harbor both c-myc and TP53 alterations.

    "Title": "Analysis of p53 gene mutations in low- and high-grade astrocytomas by polymerase chain reaction-assisted single-strand conformation polymorphism and immunohistochemistry",
    "Abstract": "Using polymerase chain reaction-assisted single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and immunohistochemical analyses, mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene were examined in 19 low- and high-grade gliomas. By PCR-SSCP and nucleotide analyses, p53 gene mutation was seen in 7 gliomas. Out of the 7 mutations, 3 were located at the CpG site of the previously proposed hot-spot codons 248 and 273, 2 were at codons 171 and 214 and the other 2 were in intron 5, 1 at the splice acceptor site and the other in the vicinity of the splice donor site. The latter 4 mutations have not, or only rarely, been observed in gliomas or in other tumors. However, their effect on the structural and functional alteration of the p53 protein was suggested by positive intranuclear p53 immunostaining in neoplastic cells in 3 mutations including the 1 at the splice acceptor site. In connection with glioma grading, the p53 gene mutation was shown to have occurred in both low- and high-grade gliomas, often in most of the neoplastic cells, as suggested by lack of distinct normal bands and ladders in SSCP and direct sequencing, respectively. The absence of recurrence and malignant transformation over a considerably long postoperative time in our low-grade glioma cases suggested that the p53 gene mutation might not be sufficient for the progression from low- to high-grade gliomas. The frequency of detection of mutation was 7/19(37%) by PCR-SSCP, 8/19(42%) by immunohistochemistry and 10/19(53%) by both methods. The results of PCR-SSCP and immunohistochemistry were consistent in 14 cases (73.7%), but not in 5 cases(26.3%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in human adrenocortical neoplasms: immunohistochemical and molecular studies",
    "Abstract": "The mechanisms of tumorigenesis of adrenocortical neoplasms have not been elucidated as yet. However, loss of heterozygosity at chromosomal locus 17p has been consistently observed in adrenocortical cancer. p53 is a recessive tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 17p. Mutations in the p53 gene play an important role in the tumorigenesis of diverse types of human neoplasms including breast and colon cancers. More than 90% of all mutations discovered in such tumors have been detected in 4 hot spot areas that lie between exons 5 and 8. In contrast to wild-type p53, mutant p53 accumulates intracellularly and can be easily detected by immunohistochemistry. We therefore investigated the frequency of p53 mutations in human adrenocortical neoplasms using molecular biology and immunohistochemistry techniques. Five patients with adrenocortical adenomas (5 female; ages 39-72 yr), 11 patients with adrenocortical carcinomas (8 female, 3 male; ages 15- 50 yr), and two adrenocortical tumor cell lines were studied. After DNA extraction from frozen tumor tissue or paraffin-embedded material, exons 5 through 8 were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and directly sequenced by the dideoxy termination method. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tumor specimens obtained during adrenalectomy using a monoclonal antibody reacting with both wild-type and mutant p53. Prevalence of mutations was adenomas, 0/5, carcinomas, 3/11, and adrenocortical cell lines, 2/2. Single point mutations were detected in 3 cases (exons 5, 6, and 7, respectively), and rearrangements of exon 7/8 and 8 were found in 2 cases. Immunohistochemistry detected strong nuclear and/or cytoplasmic p53 immunoreactivity in all adrenocortical carcinomas with point mutations of the p53 gene but not in adenomas and carcinomas with the wild-type sequence or with deletion/rearrangement of the p53 gene. We conclude that p53 plays a role in the tumorigenesis of adrenocortical carcinomas but is of less importance to benign adenomas",

    "Title": "The spectrum of TP53 mutations in bladder carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "The mutational spectrum for the TP53 gene was investigated in a large series of bladder tumors and bladder tumor cell lines. Tumors and cell lines were screened for the presence of TP53 point mutations by single- strand conformational polymorphism analysis followed by direct sequencing. Mutations were detected in 16 of 88 (18%) tumors and 4 of 14 cell lines (28%). In total, twelve missense mutations, one nonsense mutation, three deletions, and two insertions were identified by direct sequencing. Of the thirteen point mutations sequenced, only one was a transition at a CpG site, whereas five G:C-->T:A transversions were found, suggesting a major role for exogenous mutagens in bladder tumorigenesis. Tumors were also examined for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome arm 17p. LOH of one or more markers on 17p was detected in 31% of tumors. All eight tumors with a TP53 mutation from patients informative at TP53 had LOH, whereas nine tumors with LOH at TP53 did not have an identified mutation. Three tumors had LOH on 17p at sites distal to the TP53 locus but retained both TP53 alleles, suggesting the involvement of another tumor suppressor gene on 17p in bladder tumorigenesis in some tumors",

    "Abstract": "Thirty-eight WHO grade II astrocytomas and 10 malignant recurrent gliomas in these patients were examined for the presence of TP53 alterations. Seventeen/38 low grade astrocytomas and 6/10 malignant recurrent tumors harbored mutations of the gene detected by SSCP analysis and direct sequencing of PCR products. TP53 mutations in five out of six high grade mutant tumors were already present in the corresponding low grade astrocytomas. In two cases, TP53 mutations present in the low grade astrocytoma could not be demonstrated in the recurrent glioma. Immunohistochemistry with two different antibodies to the human TP53 protein revealed nuclear immunoreaction of tumor cells in 11/38 low grade and in 8/10 recurrent tumors. There was no correlation between the presence of TP53 alteration and clinical course. We conclude that, although TP53 mutations are detectable in a substantial fraction of WHO grade II astrocytomas, they do not appear to play a role in the malignant progression of these tumors and they are not of prognostic significance",

    "Title": "Carcinogen-specific mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene in lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, whose encoded protein is one of the chief regulators of the cell cycle, are proving to be the most common genetic alteration in human cancer. Point mutations have been detected in numerous human solid tumors. The types of point mutations in the p53 gene vary considerably in different kinds of human cancers, suggesting that specific etiologic agents are responsible for typical kinds and sites of mutations in the p53 gene. This study reports the detection of two unusual p53 mutations in a series of patients with lung cancer. The first case showed a one-base pair deletion at the end of exon 8, which is rarely affected by mutations, leading to a frameshift involving the following intron 8, exon 9, and intron 9. The second case exhibited two point mutations in codon 273, both either localized in the same codon on one allele or each mutation localized on a different allele in codon 273. Interestingly, the two mutations can be attributed to different mechanisms of base substitution. This is the first report of this kind. Because of evidence that the nature and site of p53 mutations reflect not only the mutagens involved in tumorigenesis but also the capacity for malignant transformation, the characterization of mutations of the p53 gene may provide a basis for assessing further risk factors, as well as for estimating prognosis in patients with lung cancer",

    "Abstract": "We studied 80 hepatocellular carcinomas from three continents for p53 gene (TP53) mutations and hepatitis B virus (HBV) sequences. p53 mutations were frequent in tumors from Mozambique but not in tumors from South Africa, China, and Germany. Independent of geographic origin, most tumors were positive for HBV sequences. X gene coding sequences of HBV were detected in 78% of tumors, whereas viral sequences in the surface antigen- and core antigen-encoding regions were present in less than 45% of tumors. These observations indicate that hepatocellular carcinomas are genetically heterogeneous. Mozambican-type of hepatocellular carcinomas are characterized by a high incidence of p53 mutations related to aflatoxins. In other tumors, the rarity of p53 mutations combined with the frequent presence of viral X gene coding sequences suggests a possible interference of HBV with the wild-type p53 function",

    "Abstract": "The epidemiologic characteristics of lung cancer in Taiwan differ from those in other parts of the world in low male-to-female ratio, the high percentage of adenocarcinoma, and the relatively high percentage of nonsmokers who are victims. To investigate possible correlation between p53 gene alteration and the unique characteristics of lung cancer here, p53 gene status of 36 patients with primary, resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was studied by directly sequencing the cDNA of the p53 gene, then acquiring clinical and pathologic data to correlate p53 gene status with clinical parameters and pathologic staging. Missense mutations were present in 42% (15 of 36) of patients with NSCLC, including 42% (10 of 24) with adenocarcinomas, and 45% (five of 11) with squamous cell carcinomas. The frequency of p53 mutation was 50% in smokers and 29% in nonsmokers (p = 0.355). The mutation occurred most frequently in exon 8 (56%), and G:C to A:T transitions in non-CpG or CpG sites were the most commonly observed base changes (56%). These findings differ from the high prevalence of G to T transversion found in previous reports. The frequency of metastasis in hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes was significantly higher in tumors with p53 mutations. The association with nodal stage was strong for mutations within exon 8, but it was less apparent for mutations in other exons probably because of the small number. This study suggests that p53 gene missense is common in NSCLC in Taiwan, but smoking is probably not the sole contributing factor. More interestingly, p53 gene mutations, especially those in exon 8, may be associated with regional nodal metastasis",

    "Abstract": "The occurrence of mutations within the coding sequence of the p53 tumour suppressor gene is now well documented for squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck region. However, evidence that these mutations are required for the maintenance and progression of squamous tumours is still formally lacking. To test this we have examined whether p53 mutations detected in primary squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue are also detected in the corresponding lymph node metastases. Three different p53 mutations were detected in each of three primary tongue squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and in each case the same mutation was detected in a lymph node metastasis excised from the same patient. Although the sample number is small, the chance of obtaining the same p53 mutation independently in both the primary and metastatic tumour of each patient is at least 10(-4), therefore the results indicate that keratinocytes harbouring these p53 mutations possess a selective advantage throughout SCC progression",

Three cancer cell lines (SCC-4, Tu-177 and FaDu) had similar amounts of p53 transcripts to normal cells, but contained significantly higher levels of p53 protein than the normal control cells. Sequencing highly conserved open reading frames of the p53 gene of these cancer cells showed point mutations in the SCC-4 and Tu-177 cell lines, a base transition from CCC to TCC occurred at codon 151; and in the line FaDu, a mutation of CGG to CTG occurred at codon 248. The HEp-2 and 1483 cancer lines contained significantly lower levels of p53 protein compared to the normal counterpart. Sequencing of p53 cDNA for HEp-2 and 1483 lines showed no mutations, but northern analysis revealed that these cell lines expressed HPV-18 E6/E7 messages. Four cell lines (SCC-9, SCC-15, SCC-25, and Tu-139) expressed negligible amounts of p53 transcripts compared to the normal counterpart and undetectable levels of p53 protein. These cell lines contained mutations in the highly conserved open reading frames of the p53 gene as follows: the SCC-9 had a deletion of 32 base pairs between codons 274 and 285; the line SCC-15 had an insertion of five base pairs between codons 224 and 225; the line SCC-25 had a deletion of two base pairs in codon 209; and the Tu-139 line had a deletion of 46 base pairs between codons 171 and 186.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

DESIGN: Mutations in the p53 gene were identified by DNA sequencing in synchronous primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas from one patient. The polymerase chain reaction and mutant- specific oligomer probes were used to detect rare tumor cells in surgical margins, lymph nodes, and swabs of the oral cavity. PATIENTS: Selected from a consecutive series of individuals with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas at a tertiary referral center. RESULTS: Two synchronous primary invasive cancers displayed different missense mutations in the p53 gene. The mutated sequence from one primary tumor was detected in metastases from both sides of the neck. Infiltrating cells from this biologically aggressive tumor were also detected by a polymerase chain reaction-based assay in a histologically normal surgical margin, accurately predicting tumor recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: p53 gene mutations were useful as molecular markers to distinguish between tumors in this case. The potential utility of detection of tumor cells in surgical margins and saliva by molecular techniques merits further investigation",

    "Title": "Overexpression of the MDM2 gene by childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells expressing the wild-type p53 gene",
    "Abstract": "The wild-type (wt) p53 tumor suppressor gene is commonly inactivated in human malignancies, either by mutations or by loss of expression. An additional proposed mechanism for inactivation of wt-p53 is amplification of the murine double minute 2 (MDM2) gene and overexpression of the MDM2 protein, which binds to p53 and eliminates its tumor suppressor function. To investigate a potential role for MDM2 in the inactivation of wt-p53 in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we examined the expression of MDM2 and p53, as well as the occurrence of p53 mutations and possible amplification of the MDM2 gene, in 19 pediatric ALL cell lines and one pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) line. Although we did not find significant amplification of the MDM2 gene in any of the leukemic lines, we detected overexpression of MDM2 in all 10 lines that expressed wt-p53. Of the 10 lines without overexpression of the MDM2 gene, six (including the AML line) did not express p53, and four expressed mutant p53 with single point mutations in exons 7 and 8. To determine whether primary leukemic cells showed a similar correlation, we analyzed the original cryopreserved leukemic bone marrow cells from seven patients from whom cell lines were established. We obtained similar results from both the primary leukemic cells and the corresponding cell lines: overexpression of MDM2 was present in primary cells that expressed wt-p53 but not in cells that lacked expression of wt-p53. These findings suggest an important role for MDM2 in the pathogenesis of pediatric ALL in which leukemic cells express wt-p53",

    "Abstract": "We have investigated the alterations of p53 and ras genes including H-, K-, and N-ras genes in 22 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases and five cell lines carrying t(1;19) by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing. The mutations of the p53 gene were found in 2 of 20 t(1;19)-ALL cases at diagnosis (10%), all of 4 cases at relapse (100%), and 4 of the 5 cell lines (80%). Four of the five patients who died had missense mutations at codons 49, 177, 179, and 248. In cases examined sequentially, one had the same point mutation at codon 179 at both diagnosis and relapse, and another had the same p53 gene mutation at codon 240 both in leukemic cells at relapse and in a cell line derived at that time. The other case had no mutation at diagnosis but had the mutation at codon 177 at relapse and cell lines derived from blast cells at diagnosis, suggesting that a small number of leukemic cells with the p53 gene mutation at diagnosis might have escaped PCR-SSCP analysis. In cell lines, SCMC-L9 had three point mutations in the p53 gene at codons 175, 248, and 358, whereas SCMC-L10 had frame shift at codons 209-211. One case had a rare polymorphism at codon 11. We found only one mutation of the N-ras gene that was a 2-bp substitution of GGT(Gly) to GTC(Val) at codon 13 among 22 t(1;19)-ALL cases and five cell lines. This case showed no mutation of the p53 gene and has had a good course. These results suggest that in t(1;19)-ALL, mutations of the p53 and ras genes are infrequent at diagnosis and that p53 gene alterations may be associated with relapse phase or progression of t(1;19)-ALL",

    "Title": "MDM2 overexpression does not account for stabilization of wild-type p53 protein in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas",
    "Abstract": "p53 protein overexpression is a frequent finding in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), being detected in over 25% of the cases. Moreover, some high-grade lymphomas and a large fraction of low-grade tumors show a pattern of scattered p53 accumulation in a limited percentage of neoplastic cells. In contrast, NHLs show a low frequency of p53 gene mutations. To investigate the molecular bases of p53 protein overexpression, a large series of NHLs was analyzed for p53 gene status. The analysis of the entire coding region of the gene (exons 2- 11) and corresponding donor and acceptor splicing sites indicated that a significant proportion of p53-positive tumors overexpresses a wild- type form of p53 protein (wt-p53). To assess whether wt-p53 accumulation was related to the formation of inactive complexes with endogenous proteins, MDM2 oncogene expression and amplification were analyzed. MDM2 overexpression was detected only in one third of the wt- p53-positive cases, thus excluding that MDM2 accounts tout court for the accumulation of a normal p53 protein. However, the fact that MDM2 overexpression was detected in only the p53-positive cases and the observation that MDM2-positive cells were a subpopulation of p53- positive cells suggest a link between the two phenomena. In particular, our results indicate that the accumulation of a wt form of p53 protein could promote the overexpression of the MDM2 gene product. In addition, the prevalence of MDM2 positivity in intermediate/high-grade tumors together with the concordant expression of wt-p53 and MDM2 only in the high-grade component of a 'composite' lymphoma suggests that perturbation in the MDM2/p53 critical ratio could play a role in lymphoma progression",

    "Abstract": "The t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation, which juxtaposes the BCL1 oncogene with the Ig heavy chain locus, has been associated with an uncommon subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) termed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). To date, no molecular marker that serves as an indicator of tumor progression or clinical prognosis has been described for NHLs with this translocation. We examined a panel of NHLs with t(11;14) for overexpression of p53 and correlated the results with single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, karyotypic features, and clinical course. NHLs with t(11;14) were identified from 30 patients. The diagnosis was MCL for 23 of 30, small lymphocytic lymphoma for 4 of 30, and diffuse large-cell lymphoma for 3 of 30 cases. The results of immunohistochemistry analysis using a monoclonal anti-p53 antibody on paraffin-embedded specimens were compared with the SSCP data, the tumor karyotypes, and clinical course of each patient. DNA sequencing of exons was performed on cases that showed conformational changes by SSCP analysis. NHLs from 5 of 23 patients with MCL were positive for p53 overexpression. Deletions of chromosome 17p were identified in 2 of 30 cases, both of which were MCLs showing p53 overexpression. Two of the five MCLs with p53 overexpression showed evidence for TP53 mutations. None of the 18 MCLs negative for p53 overexpression showed conformational changes by SSCP. For these 18 patients with MCLs that did not overexpress p53, the median survival was 63 months, compared with 12 months for the 5 patients with MCLs positive for p53 overexpression (P < .001). These results suggest that p53 overexpression in MCL with t(11;14)(q13;q32) may serve as a marker of poor prognosis",

    "Title": "The accumulation of p53 abnormalities is associated with progression of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "The genetic mechanisms underlying the genesis of low-grade mucosa- associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas and their transformation into high-grade lymphoma are poorly understood. p53 inactivation, commonly caused by mutation and allele loss, has been shown to play an important role in the early development and/or the late disease progression of many human tumors including lymphoid malignancies and, thus, may also be important in MALT lymphomagenesis. We examined 75 cases (48 low grade and 27 high grade) of MALT lymphoma for p53 allele loss and mutation as well as protein accumulation. DNA samples prepared from microdissected cell populations were used for the detection of p53 gene abnormalities. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction-based analysis of p53 CA repeat polymorphism, whereas p53 mutation was studied by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. p53 expression was assessed by immunostaining with CM1 polyclonal antibody. p53 allele loss and mutation, which resulted in the alteration in the amino acid sequence, were found in both low-grade (LOH, 3 of 44 [6.8%]; mutation, 9 of 48 [18.8%]) and high-grade (LOH, 6 of 21 [28.6%]; mutation, 9 of 27 [33.3%]) MALT lymphomas, particularly in the latter group. p53 staining was not observed in any low-grade tumors but in 6 high-grade cases that harbored missense mutations. There were also differences in the extent of p53 abnormalities, between low- and high- grade tumors. Of the 11 low-grade tumors showing p53 abnormalities, only 1 tumor showed the concomitance of p53 mutation and allele loss, whereas in high-grade tumors, 6 of 9 affected cases displayed both p53 mutation and allele loss. Our results suggest that p53 partial inactivation may play an important role in the development of low-grade MALT lymphomas, whereas complete inactivation may be associated with high-grade transformation",

    "Title": "Correlative morphologic and molecular genetic analysis demonstrates three distinct categories of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders",
    "Abstract": "The posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PT-LPDs) are a morphologically heterogeneous group of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven lymphoid proliferations of varying clonal composition. Some PT-LPDs regress after a reduction in immunosuppression, while others progress in spite of aggressive therapy. Previously defined morphologic categories do not correlate with clonality, and neither morphology nor clonality has reliably predicted the clinical behavior of PT-LPDs. We investigated 28 PT-LPD lesions occurring in 22 patients for activating alterations involving the bcl-1, bcl-2, c-myc, and H-, K- and N-ras proto-oncogenes and for mutations involving the p53 tumor suppressor gene. We correlated the results of these studies with the morphology of the lesions, their clonality based on Ig heavy and light chain gene rearrangement analysis, and the presence and clonality of EBV infection. We found that the PT-LPDs are divisible into three distinct categories as follows: (1) plasmacytic hyperplasia: most commonly arise in the oropharynx or lymph nodes, are nearly always polyclonal, usually contain multiple EBV infection events or only a minor cell population infected by a single form of EBV, and lack oncogene and tumor suppressor gene alterations; (2) polymorphic B-cell hyperplasia and polymorphic B-cell lymphoma: may arise in lymph nodes or various extranodal sites, are nearly always monoclonal, usually contain a single form of EBV, and lack oncogene and tumor suppressor gene alterations; and (3) immunoblastic lymphoma or multiple myeloma: present with widely disseminated disease, are monoclonal, contain a single form of EBV, and contain alterations of one or more oncogene or tumor suppressor genes (N-ras gene codon 61 point mutation, p53 gene mutation, or c-myc gene rearrangement). The PT-LPDs are divisible into three categories exhibiting distinct morphologic and molecular genetic characteristics. Alterations involving the N-ras and c-myc proto- oncogenes and the p53 tumor suppressor gene may play an important role in the development and/or progression of the PT-LPDs",

    "Title": "TP53 mutations emerge at early phase of myelodysplastic syndrome and are associated with complex chromosomal abnormalities",
    "Abstract": "We examined TP53 mutation in 57 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at either the MDS phase or at the terminal leukemic phase using polymerase chain reaction-mediated single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. TP53 mutations within exons 5 through 8 were found in seven patients. All these mutations were detected at the presentation of MDS whether these patients showed leukemic transformation or not. TP53 mutations were frequently found in patients with loss of the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p-) (three of seven patients with 17p-, 43%) and complex karyotypic abnormalities (five of 14, 38%). Among the seven patients with the TP53 mutation, four patients progressed to acute leukemia within 7 months from the diagnosis of MDS, and the remaining three died within 7 months without leukemic transformation. These findings suggest that mutations of the TP53 can be implicated in leukemic transformation and a poor prognosis in MDS",

    "Title": "Mutations of the p53 gene in male breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. Cancer of the male breast (MBC) is rare, accounting for less than 1% of cancer in males and representing less than 1% of all breast cancers. Reports of abnormalities in the expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in MBC have been few. METHODS. To assess the expression and mutations of the p53 gene, 35 patients with 36 MBC (one patient with bilateral breast carcinoma) were examined using immunohistochemical methods, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing. RESULTS. Thirty- one of the 36 carcinomas were studied by immunohistochemistry and by the PCR-based approach. Five patients were studied by immunohistochemistry only. Twelve patients (41.4%) of the 29 studied by molecular analysis presented an altered pattern in the single strand conformation polymorphism gel and point mutations were confirmed in all by direct DNA sequencing. Thirty-six tumors were studied by immunohistochemistry and 2 (5.5%) patients showed overexpression of the p53 protein. There were no statistically significant differences in p53 status with respect to: age, stage, estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, tumor type. Patients with normal p53 showed a predisposition, although not statistically significant, for a longer disease free survival (5.6 years versus 4.2 years) and overall survival (5.9 years versus 4.8 years) than did patients with genetically altered p53. CONCLUSIONS. The incidence of male patients detected with p53 mutations (41.4%) in this series is concordant with the incidence of p53 mutations in female breast cancer, supporting the idea that cancer of the male breast is similar to the female counterpart",

    "Title": "Multiple genetic lesions in laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas (LSCCs), this study investigated the involvement of various protooncogene loci (bcl-1, int-2, c-erbB-1, c- myc, ras) and the p53 tumor suppressor gene in 18 patients with LSCC (15 at clinical presentation, 3 in clinical relapse). METHODS. For all patients, the mutations affecting the p53 and the H-, K-, and N-ras genes were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphism, and the direct sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments. The bcl-1, int-2, c-erbB-1, and c-myc loci of 15 patients were investigated using Southern blot analysis. RESULTS. A mutation of the p53 gene was detected in 5/18 patients (approximately 28%), bcl-1 locus amplification in 4/15 (approximately 26%), c-erbB-1 locus amplification in 2/15 (approximately 13%), and c-myc locus amplification in 1/15 (approximately 6%). The simultaneous presence of more than one genetic lesion was observed in four patients; two showed int-2/bcl-1 coamplification, and two int-2/c-erbB-1 coamplification, one of whom also showed a p53 gene mutation. A novel p53 mutation involving the splice acceptor site of exon 6 was detected in one patient. Two of the five patients positive for p53 mutations had clinical relapses of primary tumors. bcl-1 locus amplification only was observed in patients with lymph node metastases (4/6). All but one of the patients with molecular genetic lesions showed a peculiar infiltrating pattern. CONCLUSIONS. Overall, these results show that alterations of known protooncogenes and the p53 tumor suppressor gene are involved in a large proportion of LSCCs (11/18; approximately 60%) and may suggest that distinct molecular pathways occur in the pathogenesis of these tumors",

    "Title": "Expression and mutation analysis of the p53 gene in uterine papillary serous carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. The status of p53 protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and correlated with genetic analysis and clinical outcome in patients with uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC). METHODS. Twenty-two patients with UPSC were identified and immunohistochemical staining of p53 protein was performed. Staining was analyzed by quantitating nuclear reactivity in 500 randomly counted cells per specimen. DNA analysis was performed on the tumors using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 4-10 of the p53 gene, followed by DNA sequencing of all variants. Clinical data and patient status were ascertained from chart reviews. RESULTS. Sixteen of the 22 (73%) tumors were scored as p53-overexpressing as determined by immunohistochemical analysis. Patients whose tumors overexpressed p53 had a statistically significant shorter survival than those whose tumors did not (P < 0.022). DNA analysis of the 22 tumors revealed five with mutations of the p53 gene. Only three of these mutations were observed in tumors that overexpressed p53. CONCLUSIONS. A relatively large percentage of UPSC tumors exhibited high p53 immunoreactivity. Overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis. Positive immunohistochemistry for p53 protein in UPSC is not necessarily indicative of a genetic mutation",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. In human brain tumors, sensitivity to procarbazine as measured by sensitivity in a xenograft tumor model correlated inversely with amounts of the DNA repair enzyme O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AT). METHODS. To test the hypothesis that mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in human tumors also can correlate with the response to chemotherapy, p53 mutations2 were identified in primary human malignant brain tumors and cell lines in which AT activity and procarbazine sensitivity in a xenograft model was ascertained. RESULTS. Mutations were identified in 7 of 21 (33%) specimens tested. Specimens containing p53 mutations tended to exhibit an increased growth delay in procarbazine-treated xenografts and lower amounts of AT. CONCLUSIONS. p53 mutations in brain tumors may contribute to procarbazine sensitivity by failing to induce arrest at the G1/S cell-cycle checkpoint, thereby preventing the repair of procarbazine-induced genetic alterations",

    "Title": "p53 mutation and MDM2 amplification are rare even in human papillomavirus-negative cervical carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most commonly found genetic alteration in human cancer. The E6 gene product of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 can inactivate the p53 protein by promoting its degradation. Because most HPV-positive cervical carcinoma cell lines contain wild-type p53 whereas HPV-negative cell lines have point mutations in the p53 gene, a major role in the development of HPV-negative cervical cancer has been attributed to p53. Recent studies, however, have observed no consistent presence of p53 mutation in HPV-negative primary cervical carcinomas. The MDM2 oncogene, which forms an autoregulatory loop with the wild-type p53 protein, has been found amplified in a high percentage of human sarcomas, thus abolishing the antiproliferative function of p53. METHODS. Forty-three primary cervical carcinomas and 10 autopsy-derived distant metastases from one patient were examined for p53 mutation and MDM2 amplification. These tumors had been selected from 238 cervical cancers that had been HPV-typed by Southern blot hybridization and polymerase chain reaction as a representative sample for their HPV status and their clinicopathologic characteristics. Seventeen of the cases had a remarkably good or poor clinical outcome. Human papillomavirus DNA sequences had been detected in 30 of these 43 primary tumors and 13 were negative for HPV by both methods. p53 mutation in the highly conserved exons 5-8 was studied by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. MDM2 amplification was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. RESULTS. Only two missense point mutations and one nucleotide sequence polymorphism were detected: a TAC-->TGC transition in codon 234 in exon 7, resulting in a Tyr-->Lys substitution, a CGT-->TGT transition in codon 273 in exon 8, resulting in an Arg-->Cys substitution and a polymorphism (CGA-->CGG) in codon 213 in exon 6. Both tumors revealing the point mutations were HPV-negative carcinomas. Amplification of the MDM2 gene was observed in 1 of the 53 specimens tested. CONCLUSIONS. In contrast to data derived from cultured cervical carcinoma cell lines and primary sarcomas, these results indicate that p53 mutation and amplification of the MDM2 oncogene are rare even in HPV-negative primary cervical carcinomas. However, to the authors; knowledge, this is the first observation of MDM2 amplification in humans outside sarcomas and neuroepithelial tumors",

    "Title": "Molecular and immunohistochemical p53 status in liposarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma: identification of seven new mutations for soft tissue sarcomas",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. p53 mutations are the most frequently observed tumor- related genetic changes. Mutational analysis concerns mostly carcinomas and is not comprehensive for soft tissue sarcomas. Among soft tissue sarcomas, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and liposarcoma represent the most frequent tumor types. Most of the few identified mutations for soft tissue sarcomas are localized in the core domain of p53. A correlation between p53 positive immunoreactivity, missense mutations, and a poor prognosis is generally assumed. However, the character of p53 mutations and their functional importance for the clinical process is still unknown. METHODS. Sixty-two soft tissue sarcoma samples were investigated for the presence of p53 mutations and for p53 immunoreactivity. Exons 4-9 of the p53 gene were amplified from genomic DNA with the polymerase chain reaction. A prescreen for mutations was performed by nonradioactive single strand conformation polymorphism analysis; striking cases were sequenced directly. For an evaluation of the immunohistochemical status, five p53 antibodies were used. RESULTS. In 10 tumor samples 7 new p53 mutations and one polymorphism were identified. Mutations were detected for five liposarcomas (four patients) and four MFHs (three patients). Of the seven mutations, three were missense point mutations, three were deletions, and one was a complex conversion. All mutations but one were localized in the core domain of p53. Of 62 tumor samples, 56% (14 of 32 liposarcomas and 21 of 30 MFHs) were positive for p53 immunostaining. CONCLUSIONS. The mutations identified in the core domain affect codons that are structurally or functionally involved in DNA binding. A relation between p53 positive immunoreactivity and a poor prognosis, but not with an exclusively high tumor grade, is evident. p53 mutations in soft tissue sarcomas have a similar spectrum to those in carcinomas",

    "Title": "p53 mutations and prognosis in bladder tumors",
    "Abstract": "The incidence of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17p and p53 gene mutations was assessed in 43 bladder tumor patients. Histological findings, cigarette smoking and prognosis were examined for possible correlation with the presence or absence of loss of heterozygosity on 17p and p53 mutations. Of 20 informative cases 10 (50.0%) showed loss of heterozygosity of 17p13, including 9 (90.0%) with disease beyond stage pT2. The p53 mutations were detected in 20 of 43 patients (46.5%), including 9 (95.0%) with disease beyond grade 2 and 17 (85.0%) with cancer beyond stage pT2. The incidence of p53 gene mutations was not significantly influenced by habitual smoking but G:C to T:A substitutions, often observed in lung cancers, were detected only in mutations from smokers (5 of 10 or 50%, p < 0.05). Groups with and without loss of heterozygosity showed essentially the same results, while significant differences were found for groups with grades 1 and 2 to 3 (p < 0.05) cancer, stages pT1 and pT2 to 4 (p < 0.01) disease, and with and without p53 gene mutations (p < 0.01, Cox-Mantel test). Genetic alternation in chromosome 17p and p53 mutations would, thus, appear to occur more frequently in high grade and invasive bladder tumors. Cigarette smoking may possibly be a determining factor of mutations of the p53 gene in bladder tumors. Our results indicate that an unfavorable prognostic factor may possibly be linked not only to histopathological findings but the presence of a p53 mutation in bladder tumors as well. Accordingly, mutations of the p53 gene may be deeply involved in late events of tumorigenesis and possibly useful as ideal molecular markers for prognosis in bladder tumors",

    "Abstract": "Surgical specimens from 30 patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder were examined for the presence of mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. All of the specimens were superficial, low grade cancer, and 10 patients had recurrences during an observation period of 24 months following the initial surgical treatment. Among the 30 patients with superficial bladder cancer, 4 were found to have the mutated p53 gene and 3 of them had recurrences, which involved either invasive or high grade tumors. Two of these recurrent tumors with the p53 gene mutation showed identical mutations with those primary tumors, whereas the other one did not have the same mutation. The data suggest that bladder cancers with a mutation of the p53 gene have a greater probability of poor prognosis than those which do not, even if the primary lesion was a superficial, low grade tumor. Therefore, the presence of the p53 gene mutation may provide important clues to the factors involved in bladder cancer",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 30 primary testicular tissues from 26 patients representing two groups. Group one consisted of eleven cases (6 nonseminomatous germ cell tumors and 5 seminomas) in which tissue samples for DNA analysis were microdissected from paraffin block regions with elevated immunohistochemical staining for p53 protein. Group two consisted of 19 testis tumor tissues which had been fresh frozen and were chosen to correspond to archival tissue specimens exhibiting elevated levels of p53 protein. The DNA was extracted from these tissues and subjected to exon specific amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cold single-strand conformation polymorphism (Cold SSCP) analysis. RESULTS: In these cases with elevated p53 protein, no p53 gene exon 5-8 mutations were detected except 1 seminoma with a codon 140 silent mutation (no protein alteration). CONCLUSIONS: Testicular tumors appear to exhibit elevated levels of wild-type p53 protein, the significance of which is yet to be elucidated",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES. To determine the frequency of abnormal p53 expression and to characterize confirmed p53 mutations in tumors from patients with clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate. METHODS. p53 protein nuclear accumulation was determined immunohistochemically in the initial diagnostic tumor specimens from 37 patients with clinically localized prostate carcinoma. Two primary antibodies were used on all specimens. Structural analysis of the p53 gene was performed using the methods of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. RESULTS. In 1 of the 37 (2.7%) tumor specimens, intense p53 nuclear staining was demonstrated using either antibody PAb 1801 or CM-1. The staining in this case was heterogeneous, with approximately 40% of tumor nuclei staining for p53. This tumor specimen was microdissected and DNA was extracted. Following PCR amplification, abnormally migrating bands were noted on SSCP analysis of exon 8. DNA sequencing confirmed the mutation as a C-->A transversion in codon 281 (asp-->glu). PCR/SSCP analysis of exons 5 through 8 was also performed for seven additional tumors that were negative for p53 nuclear accumulation by immunohistochemical (IHC) methods. All of these specimens demonstrated wild-type p53. CONCLUSIONS. The results of this study confirm and extend our previous findings that p53 mutations are rare in clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate. In detecting clonal p53 mutations, standard immunohistochemical technique correlates reliably with structural p53 gene analysis of the evolutionary conserved domains encompassing exons 5-8. Importantly, most reports have demonstrated that p53 mutations detected by IHC are a late step in the progression of prostate cancer and are associated with advanced disease, dedifferentiation, and the acquisition of androgen independence",

In this study, 38 colorectal cancers were analysed for mutations detected in the p53 gene by single-strand conformational polymorphism and DNA sequence analysis, and the results were compared with p53 protein expression detected by immunohistochemistry. A very strict association (P < 0.0001) was found between genetic alterations and protein accumulation, as detected by the PAb 1801 monoclonal antibody. p53 expression and gene mutations were more frequent in rectal than in colonic cancers. No relation was observed with Dukes' stage, even though most of the mutations were at exon 7 in Dukes' A-B cancers and almost all mutations at exon 8 were observed in Dukes' C-D cancers. DNA ploidy was not generally associated with p53 protein expression or gene mutations. However, 83 per cent of cases with exon 5 and 6 mutations were diploid or near-diploid and 71 per cent of cases with mutations at exons 7 and 8 were aneuploid. Tumours with p53 gene mutations at exon 5 had a higher median [3H]thymidine labelling index (17 per cent) than those with mutations at exons 6, 7, and 8 (11.8 per cent)",

We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to detect mutations. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the DCC locus was ascertained directly by performing PCR on the variable number of tandem repeats within the gene. Mutations of the K-ras gene were not detected in any gastric adenoma or carcinoma. APC mutations were detected in 20 per cent (6/30) of the adenomas but in only 1.4 per cent (1/72) of the carcinomas. In contrast, the p53 gene was frequently mutated in carcinomas (35 per cent; 25/72), but not in adenomas. LOH at the DCC locus was a frequent occurrence in carcinomas (58 per cent; 11/19 informative cases) but was infrequent in adenomas (14 per cent; 1/7). Alterations of the p53 and DCC genes occurred frequently both in differentiated and in undifferentiated gastric carcinomas. The considerable differences in the incidences of genetic alterations between gastric adenoma and carcinoma indicate that the sequential development of gastric carcinoma from adenoma is uncommon in gastric carcinogenesis",

    "Abstract": "The TP53 gene mutation pattern in prostatic cancer was examined in relation to progression and survival, using archival formalin-fixed pre- and post-treatment tumour specimens from 84 prostatic cancer patients. Thirty-four had hormone-sensitive tumours and 50 were hormone- resistant. Six of the 34 (18 per cent) therapy-responding tumours and 19 of the 50 (38 per cent) hormone-resistant tumours showed p53 protein accumulation in the post-treatment specimen. Both pre- and post- treatment specimens from these 25 patients were analysed for mutation of the conserved regions of the TP53 gene (exons 5-8), using constant denaturant gel electrophoresis (CDGE) followed by DNA sequencing. In the post-treatment samples, mutations were detected in three of the six patients with hormone-responsive tumours and in 11 of the 19 patients with hormone-resistant tumours. The three (100 per cent) patients with therapy-responsive tumours with mutations and nine of the 11 (82 per cent) patients with therapy-resistant tumours with mutations died of the disease. Thirteen of the 14 mutations in the post-treatment specimens were transitions, 11 occurring at CpG dinucleotides in which codon 273 was involved in ten. A significantly higher proportion of tumours with mutations were poorly differentiated compared with tumours without mutation (P < 0.04). Our findings indicate that TP53 mutation is a late event in tumour development of the prostate gland and that codon 273 might be a 'hotspot' for mutation in the progression of the disease",

    "Title": "p53 gene alterations in special types of breast carcinoma: a molecular and immunohistochemical study in archival material",
    "Abstract": "The p53 locus on the short arm of chromosome 17 at 17p13.1 was examined for small genomic deletions and mutations in 23 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cases of special types of breast carcinoma (six medullary, seven apocrine, five differentiated tubular, and five papillary). p53 mutations in the evolutionarily conserved exons 5-9 were detected in 11 cases (four apocrine, two papillary, two medullary, and three differentiated tubular), using the novel non-radioactive PCR- based Hydrolink mutation detection enhancement (MDE) method, and confirmed by direct sequencing of the PCR products. Missense mutations causing amino acid substitutions were evenly distributed among exons. One case of apocrine carcinoma showed a polymorphism at codon 213 (CGA-- >CGG). Twelve out of 23 cases were found to express a strong nuclear signal against CM-1 and DO-7, two anti-p53-specific antibodies. Small genomic deletions in the vicinity of the p53 locus were detected in 11 tumours (three papillary, three differentiated tubular, two medullary, and three apocrine carcinomas), using the multiplex PCR method. No statistical correlation was found between deletions at 17p13.1 and p53 mutations (P < 0.5). In addition, p53 mutations and immunoexpression correlated with the c-erbB-2 gene product, an oncogenic protein that has been implicated in cell cycle control (P < 0.001). Our findings suggest that genomic alterations of the p53 gene are quite common events associated with special types of breast carcinoma, particularly of the apocrine subtype, but the prognostic value is unlikely to be of clinical importance",

    "Abstract": "The frequent involvement of chromosome 17p abnormalities in the progression of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) led us to investigate the involvement of the p53 tumour suppressor gene located on chromosome 17p. We analysed 31 samples from four patients sequentially, and 16 patients in blast crisis only, using single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 5-8, followed by cloning and sequencing. The sequential samples ranged from diagnosis through to late disease. We found that 15% of our blast crisis samples had p53 abnormalities. In our sequential studies we found two of the four patients analysed in more detail had p53 mutations in the late chronic phase of disease (11 and 5 months prior to blast crisis becoming apparent). These chronic phase mutations differed from the p53 abnormalities found in the blast crisis samples from these patients. One patient also had the same chronic phase mutation at post bone marrow transplant relapse. Our results suggest that, in some cases, sequential investigations through CML disease progression of p53 mutations and other oncogenes/proto-oncogenes may provide early indications of the routes of disease progression to blast crisis",

    "Abstract": "We analysed p53 mutations in 24 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and overt acute myeloid leukaemia after a period of MDS, using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. In exons 5 to 8, mobility shifts were detected in five of the 24 patients. Sequence analysis was subsequently performed, and four missense mutations (16.7%) and one silent nucleotide substitution were identified. Patients harbouring mutations were characterized as having advanced disease. Loss of the wild type allele was observed in three of the four patients with missense mutations. No mobility shifts of the N- ras or FMS gene were detected in these four patients. We next analysed the correlation of the p53 mutations with the progression of MDS in three patients. The mutation was accompanied by the progression in two of the three patients. These findings suggest that mutations of the p53 gene are associated with progression in some cases of MDS, while being compatible with stable disease or clonal evolution in others",

    "Title": "Molecular epidemiology of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Egypt",
    "Abstract": "We have characterized immunophenotypically defined acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Egypt for rearrangements of the antigen receptor genes, and correlated this with rearrangements of ALL-1 and the presence of p53 mutations. Thirty-nine cases were analyzed for rearrangements of the immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes. All precursor B-cell ALLs (12 cases) contained rearranged Ig heavy-chain (JH) region which was biallelic in 92% of these tumors. In addition to JH rearrangements, TCR delta, beta and gamma rearrangements were observed in 80, 40 and 30% of these cases, respectively. TCR genes were invariably rearranged in T-cell ALLs (11 cases). A small fraction (2/11) of T-cell ALL showed concurrent IgJH rearrangement which was monoallelic. Simultaneous rearrangement of IgJH and TCR genes was also observed in both cases of biphenotypic ALL (coexpressing B and T markers). We observed marked heterogeneity in the pattern of rearrangement of antigen receptor genes in mixed-lineage leukemias (ALL coexpressing myeloid-associated markers), including the retention of germline configuration in two cases. Rearrangements of the ALL-1 gene were confined to the leukemias that demonstrated lineage infidelity. Mutations in p53 were infrequent and were present in only three of 47 ALL cases (6%) analyzed; two of these were mixed-lineage leukemias. These results suggest that mixed-lineage and biphenotypic leukemias accumulate pathogenetic lesions that are distinct from B- and T-cell ALL, and that ALL in developing countries includes molecular entities similar to those in developed countries",

    "Abstract": "Although the prototype of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) is an aggressive T cell neoplasm, ATL manifests four major clinical subtypes, acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering. We studied the relationship between p53 gene alteration and clinical features in 34 patients with ATL, 14 acute type, 15 chronic type, and five crisis type transformed from chronic type. Using a polymerase chain reaction/single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) assay, followed by nucleotide sequencing, we detected mutations of the p53 gene in six of the 14 acute type patients, two of the five crisis type, and one of the 15 chronic type patients. Gene dosage studies, using PCR amplification and Southern blotting, showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the p53 gene in four of the 14 acute type patients, two of the five crisis type, and one of 14 chronic type patients examined. These observations indicated that the frequency of p53 gene alterations in the acute and crisis types of ATL was markedly higher than that in chronic type, suggesting that p53 gene alteration plays a role in the disease progression of ATL",

    "Abstract": "The clinical heterogeneity of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of B cell lineage reflects the presence of distinct molecular pathways leading to well-defined ALL molecular subtypes. These molecular pathways include the formation of the fusion transcripts BCR/ABL and E2A/PBX1, due to t(9;22) and t(1;19), respectively, as well as rearrangements of the MLL gene at 11q23 and of c-MYC at 8q24. Hyperdiploid ALL in the absence of chromosomal structural abnormalities is an additional ALL molecular subtype. Mutations of the RAS family genes and of the p53 tumor suppressor gene represent additional genetic lesions detected in a fraction (10-20%) of ALL cases. RAS activation in ALL may be detected in all molecular subtypes of ALL and denotes poor prognosis. Conversely, little is known regarding the clinical and biological features of ALL cases carrying p53 mutations. In order to help clarify the role of p53 inactivation in ALL development, we have determined the frequency of p53 mutations throughout the molecular spectrum of B cell lineage ALL. We report that p53 inactivation in ALL of B cell lineage is restricted to cases carrying a rearrangement of MLL or c-MYC, whereas it is consistently negative in other molecular subgroups. These data underline the molecular heterogeneity of ALL of B cell lineage and indicate that at least some of the molecular pathways involved in ALL pathogenesis require more than one genetic lesion",

    "Title": "High incidence of p53 alterations (mutation, deletion, overexpression) in head and neck primary tumors and metastases; absence of correlation with clinical outcome. Frequent protein overexpression in normal epithelium and in early non-invasive lesions",
    "Abstract": "We have analysed 78 head and neck carcinomas (50 node metastases and 28 primary tumors including 13 matched specimens) in 65 patients for p53 alterations. Mutations were found in 54 (69%) tumors. Of the 53 mutations within exons, 40 (76%) were missense, five (9%) nonsense and eight (15%) microdeletions or microinsertions. Twenty-five (47%) mutations were transitions mostly G-->A (40%) and 20 (38%) were transversions, mostly G-->T (25%), thus confirming the role of tobacco carcinogens in the induction of these mutations. The incidence of mutations was not different in primary tumors (68%) and node metastases (70%) indicating that this gene alteration was not related to the metastatic dissemination. For eight patients, mutations were observed in matched primary tumors and metastases, indicating clonal dissemination of tumor cells in most of these carcinomas. There was a good correlation between mutations and protein overexpression (Fisher's exact test P < 10(-4). Immunostaining was also observed in basal cells from normal epithelium and in early lesions adjacent to the primary tumor in 11/15 (73%) specimens irrespective of the presence of mutation in the corresponding tumors. These data confirm that p53 overexpression is an early event in the multistep process of epithelial cell carcinogenesis. Loss of heterozygosity for the TP53 locus was detected in 54% of tumors but no association was found with mutation (Fisher's exact test P = 0.14). No mdm-2 amplification was detected in any tumors. No correlation was found between mutation and clinical parameters, the 5-year survival rates were not different (log rank test P = 0.39) in patients with and without mutation. In conclusion, we have shown that p53 gene mutations and deletions and protein overexpression are frequent in the most aggressive head and neck carcinomas but are not associated with disease progression. The presence of protein in normal mucosa and in non-invasive lesions may constitute a biomarker for early stages of carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations inside and outside of exons 5-8: the patterns differ in breast and other cancers",
    "Abstract": "Most studies of mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene in tumors have examined only exons 5-8. Our laboratory previously found 64 mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene in 194 primary breast cancers. Herein, we report 18 additional mutations found outside of exons 5-8. Mutations are present in exons 4, 9 and 10, and flanking splice junctions, but not in the promotor region or in exons 1, 2, 3 and 11. No missense mutations are found outside of exons 5-8. Instead, there is a predominance of frameshift mutations with lesser numbers of nonsense and splice site mutations. In contrast, the majority of mutations in exons 5-8 in this sample are missense changes and all of these are at amino acids that are identical in the 11 known p53 sequences that represent about 1.6 billion years of evolutionary divergence. The difference in mutational pattern between these two regions of the p53 gene is due to a lack of missense mutations and inframe microdeletions outside of exons 5-8. A review of our database of p53 mutations (De Vries et al., in preparation) shows that the patterns of mutation inside and outside of exons 5-8 differ in other types of cancers as well. The paucity of missense mutations in exons 2-4 and 9-11 in breast and other cancers (even at amino acids identical throughout p53 gene evolution) suggest that at least some missense mutations result in a phenotype other than malignant transformation. These data also illustrate the importance of examining identical exons when comparing the pattern of p53 gene mutations in different populations",

    "Title": "Increased incidence of p53 mutations is associated with hepatic metastasis in colorectal neoplastic progression",
    "Abstract": "Within a panel of 15 colon carcinoma cell lines we have characterized the p53 gene status using immunocytochemistry (ICC), SSCP and direct sequence analysis. Extension of this analysis to the use of ICC on 104 colonic lesions, representative of different stages of colonic neoplastic progression, showed an absence of detectable p53 nuclear staining in preneoplastic poly lesions (20 cases) with staining of 52% (25/48) of primary colon carcinomas and 81% (29/36) of hepatic metastases, suggestive of an increased incidence of p53 mutations in late stage lesions of colonic cancer. To address this issue more directly, we analysed 18 primary colon carcinomas and hepatic metastases excised coincidentally from the same patients.  In ICC, p53 nuclear staining was recorded in matching lesions from eight individuals where direct sequencing revealed identical mutations in each case. In four individuals no ICC staining was detected in either lesion an molecular analysis revealed wild type sequence in exons 4-9. In six individuals p53 nuclear staining was observed in the hepatic metastases of patients but not the primary lesion. Molecular analysis revealed point mutation events in hepatic metastases from these patients which were not detected in the primary tumor. The point mutations identified in colon carcinomas were predominantly transition events (83%) located in previously characterized colon hotspot regions. These results demonstrate an increased incidence of p53 mutations associated with secondary lesions of colorectal tumors suggestive of a role for p53 in the establishment of colorectal hepatic metastases.",

    "Title": "Sequential molecular genetic changes in lung cancer development",
    "Abstract": "Epithelial tumours develop through a sequence of pre-invasive lesions of increasing disarray driven by underlying somatic genetic changes. We have studied the occurrence of the two most common somatic genetic changes associated with lung cancer in a series of premalignant bronchial lesions representing different stages in lung tumorigenesis. We present evidence that allele loss on chromosome 3 precedes damage to the p53 gene. Damage to chromosome 3 itself appears to be sequential in that the pattern of allele loss seen in dysplasia is often much more discrete than in invasive tumours. This implies that preneoplastic lesions may be a useful source of material for deletion mapping studies aimed at localising the position of tumour suppressor genes. We illustrate this by the comparison of an interstitial deletion described in this study with a homozygous deletion we have described previously, which has resulted in a better definition of the localisation of a tumour suppressor gene believed to be involved in lung cancer development",

    "Title": "Alterations in telomeric repeat length in lung cancer are associated with loss of heterozygosity in p53 and Rb",
    "Abstract": "In the two-stage model of controlling cellular senescence in cultured human fibroblasts, retinoblastoma (Rb) and p53 proteins may be key factors regulating the mortality stage 1 mechanism. In addition, the critical loss of telomeric DNA due to the end-replication problem may result in the mortality stage 2 mechanism. Cells which acquire telomerase activity can overcome the M2 mechanism by stabilizing telomere length and thus become immortal (telomere hypothesis). At present it is known whether cellular immortality is a prerequisite for all human cancers. To investigate this question and the applicability of the two-stage model to human cancers, we analysed the relationship between alterations of telomere length and other genetic changes in lung cancer. Among 60 primary lung cancer tissues, telomere length alterations were observed in 16 tumors (26.7%) including 14 with short and two with elongated telomeres. Ten of them revealed allelic loss of both p53 and Rb genes, and remaining six showed no abnormalities in both genes. We propose that inactivation of both p53 and Rb genes may promote cell divisions causing telomere shortening in lung cancer as in the two-stage model, while there may be another pathway to overcome both M1 and M2 mechanisms, especially for adenocarcinoma",

Here we searched for possible mutations in the entire coding region of tumor suppressor gene p53 in primary human prostatic carcinomas, using polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of RNA. We found p53 gene mutations in 4 of 21 cases (19%). DNA sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products revealed missense point mutations that resulted in amino acid changes in exon 5 or 3 in three cases and single base deletions in exon 7 in two cases. One case contained both a missense point mutation and a single base deletion. Three of these four cases were pathologically diagnosed as poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, and three of the four cases were clinically localized to stage C or D. None of seven noncancerous prostate tissues nor three well- differentiated adenocarcinoma tissues showed any mutations. The present results suggest that p53 gene mutation is involved in the late progression steps of human prostate carcinogenesis",

    "Abstract": "Recent investigations have demonstrated p53 and Rb alterations in a subset of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). Further genetic changes during tumor progression include overexpression of the c-myc gene in a significant number of mainly invasive bladder tumors. To study the possible interactions between these genes in TCC, urothelial cancer cell lines were chosen as an in vitro model. Expression and mutation of p53 was studied in 15 bladder cancer cell lines by immunocytochemistry, Western blot, polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing of double stranded PCR products of exons 4, 5, 7 and 8 of genomic DNA. C-myc expression and gene structure were studied using Northern and Southern blot techniques Rb protein expression was analyzed by Western blot. Twelve of 15 cell lines showed either p53 mutations or abnormal protein expression. Consistent with previous studies, five cell lines did not express Rb protein. None of the cell lines studied retained both tumor suppressor genes in a functional form. The c-myc gene appeared to be intact in all cell lines and copy numbers were close to normal. Northern analysis demonstrated that all cell lines expressed c-myc mRNA but evidence for altered regulation was found in at least two cell lines. Our data suggest that amplification or translocation are not the underlying mechanism for c-myc overexpression in urothelial tumors. No correlation between loss of Rb protein and c-myc expression was observed. The results presented here for the cell lines match well those obtained in vivo. Thus, these cell lines may provide a suitable model for further analysis of molecular alterations in urothelial cancer",

All patients were from regions of low NPC incidence in China. Sequencing of exon 7 and exon 8, revealed p53 gene mutation in 15 of the 23 specimens (65.2%). All the mutations were at codon 273(CGT-->CAT), so that arginine encoded by this codon was replaced by histidine. In addition, p53 overexpression was found in another NPC specimen without mutation in exon 7 or 8 of p53 gene. The results suggest that p53 gene mutation is of common occurrence in NPC. The hot-spot mutation at codon 273 might be related to some special carcinogen in the environment, or this change be essential in the multi-step process of carcinogenesis of the nasopharynx.",

All positive point mutations of p53 exon 7 existed in colon carcinomas in this study. The point mutation in p53 exon 7 was usually associated with poorly differentiated primary carcinomas (P = 0.0178) and the mutation rate of was higher in Duckes C stage of the disease than in stage Duckes A and B (P = 0.0361). Thus p53 exon 7 point mutation in primary colorectal tumors and regional lymph nodes may identity a subgroup of colorectal cancer patients with more aggressive disease and may be as a new tumor markers for assessing the prognosis of colorectal carcinomas.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of p53 mutations in European hepatocarcinogenesis. METHODS: DNA extracts from 20 microdissected tumor samples were investigated. Nucleotide sequence analysis of subcloned polymerase chain reaction-fragments of the conserved domain exons 5-8 was performed in order to detect heterogeneous distribution of p53 mutated cells within the tumors. In a screening procedure four clones of each exon 5-8 were analyzed. To confirm the observed mutations polymerase chain reaction and subcloning was repeated. RESULTS: Sequence analysis confirmed a mutation in only two cases (10%). One at codon 220 (exon 6) was a homogeneous transition in nearly all clones from TAT to TGT. The other mutation was a transition from cGG to CAG at the known hot spot codon 248 (exon 7). It was found in 30% of the clones. We conclude that the other mutations from the first step were artefacts due to the infidelity of the taq- polymerase. All tumors had wild type sequence at the reported hot spot codon 249. The minor importance of p53 gene alterations in European hepatocarcinogenesis was further confirmed at the protein level by immunohistochemistry. Only the tumors with the heterogeneous p53 mutation at codon 248 showed a p53 overexpression in nearly 30% of the nuclei. None of the other tumors showed higher levels of p53 expression. CONCLUSIONS: We therefore conclude that the incidence of p53 mutations in European hepatocellular carcinomas is very low. Generally there may be no heterogeneous distribution of p53 mutated cells within a tumor. The contribution of this genetic alteration to hepatocarcinogenesis in Europe seems of little importance",

    "Abstract": "Expression of mutant p53 detected by immunohistochemistry has been described in human malignant melanoma, but there are few reports of molecular analyses. To investigate the genetic basis for p53 expression in malignant melanoma, we examined 58 primary tumors and 5 cutaneous metastases. The entire coding sequence of the p53 gene was screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct genomic sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products. p53 and mdm-2 expression were studied by immunohistochemistry. Two p53 gene mutations could be found in 1/63 samples examined, both having occurred in the same specimen from a patient with a nodular melanoma. p53 and mdm-2 expression were found immunohistochemically to increase with tumor progression both in frequency and in the mean proportion of positive cells, with the same cases staining positively for both antibodies. Our results suggest that a) p53 gene mutations are a rare event in human melanoma; b) accumulation and thus immunohistochemically detectable expression of p53 may result from posttranslational mechanisms affecting the p53 gene product; and c) p53 and mdm-2 are more important in late events in melanoma carcinogenesis",

    "Abstract": "The p53 gene product is required for activation of an apoptotic pathway triggered by oncogenes and cytotoxic agents. Wilms' tumor, a pediatric renal malignancy, provides a paradigm for evaluating genetic events involved in tumor progression. This malignancy is generally not associated with p53 mutations, and even in advanced disease states is quite responsive to current treatment regimens. The anaplastic histological variant of Wilms' tumor, however, is frequently associated with p53 gene mutations and shows poor prognosis. We analyzed seven Wilms' tumors for which we had paired samples from nonanaplastic and anaplastic regions. p53 mutations were detected in six of these tumors, five of which demonstrated mutations restricted to anaplastic regions. Nonanaplastic cells of the sixth sample were heterozygous for a p53 mutation, whereas the anaplastic area of this tumor showed reduction to homozygosity. These results indicate that progression to anaplasia is associated with clonal expansion of cells which have acquired a p53 mutation. We demonstrated that tumor cells with p53 mutations show attenuated apoptosis, suggesting that such lesions may provide a selective advantage in vivo by decreasing cell death",

    "Abstract": "K-ras and p53 gene mutations in intestinal-type gastric carcinomas from a high-incidence area around Florence, Italy, were studied by single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing analysis. Single- strand conformation polymorphism analysis of K-ras indicated aberrant bands in 13 of 34 cases. Sequencing revealed point mutations in 7 (including two at a previously unreported site in codon 11), a significantly higher frequency than reported in countries other than Japan. No K-ras mutations were identified in stage III tumors. Single- strand conformation polymorphisms in p53 exons 5-8 occurred in 30 of 34 cases, with mutations identifiable by direct sequencing in 65% of the cases. Of these, 91% were base substitutions, a value similar to that usually reported, but the percentage of G:C to A:T transitions (90% in this study, 89% in all published European cases combined) differed significantly from that in Oriental cases (48%). The percentage of A:T to G:C transitions was greater in Oriental (22%) than European cases (2%), as was also true for transversions (30% in Oriental tumors, 9% in European tumors). The frequency of mutations at CpG sites (14%) varied significantly from the 67% in cases from a neighboring region in Italy. Helicobacter pylori infection was established in 19 cases and was somewhat more common in cases lacking a p53 mutation",

Loss of heterozygosity was assessed at between 5 and 11 tumor sites/patient. Allelic losses at 4 loci (1q32-qter, 3p14.3-21.1, 17q12, 17q21.3-23) were noted. Three cases demonstrated a different pattern of allelic loss at various anatomic sites within the same patient. In an additional case, a mutation of the p53 gene, detected by quantitative PCR followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, was detected in only 2 of 5 tumor sites. The pattern of allelic loss and the mutational pattern of the p53 gene varied at tumor sites within the same patient in 4 of 6 cases of PSCP. These findings are consistent with histopathological evidence that PSCP is multifocal in origin",

    "Abstract": "Renal cell carcinomas sometimes show sarcomatoid transformation, thus comprising both sarcomatous and carcinomatous components. Such sarcomatoid renal cell carcinomas are highly malignant with pronounced proliferative activity. The present investigation was conducted to assess the mutational status of the p53 and H-ras genes independently in carcinomatous and sarcomatous portions of individual tumors, applying PCR, subcloning, and sequencing to 14 cases. Sarcomatoid portions showed an extremely high mutation rate for the 53 gene (11 of 14, 78.6%) with two mutational hot spots at codons 278 (8 of 14, 57.1%) and 244 (6 of 14, 42.9%). Five cases showed double mutations, four cases had mutations at codons 278 and 244, and one case had mutations at codons 278 and 248. In contrast, the carcinomatous portions demonstrated a low mutation rate for the p53 gene (2 of 14, 14.3%) and no double mutations were detected. Ten cases showed genetic heterogeneity in the p53 gene between the two tumor components. Furthermore, p53 overexpression was immunohistochemically observed only in those components with p53 mutations, mainly in the sarcomatoid portions. No H-ras mutations were observed. The findings strongly suggest that p53 mutations leading to overexpression of p53 protein are closely associated with sarcomatoid transformation in renal cell carcinomas",

    "Abstract": "A significant black/white difference in breast cancer prognosis has been observed in the United States. Alterations of p53 tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer have been associated with poor prognosis. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that p53 gene alterations are related to the difference in prognosis between black and white breast cancer patients. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast tissue blocks were available from 45 black and 47 white patients for PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. The types of p53 gene alterations were compared between blacks and whites. Associations between p53 gene alterations and survival were also evaluated. Three missense, 2 nonsense, 1 microdeletion, 1 intron, and 4 silent mutations were detected in blacks, while 7 missense, 1 microdeletion, 1 silent mutation, and 3 polymorphisms were observed in whites. Among the point mutations, G:C to A:T transitions at non-CpG sites were found in 80.0% of blacks (8 of 10) and 62.5% of whites (5 of 8). Significantly poorer survival associated with p53 gene alterations was observed for blacks (P = 0.012), but not for whites. Black patients with p53 alterations had a significant 4-5-fold excess risk of death from breast cancer than those without p53 alterations. Adjustment for stage, age, tumor histopathology, receptor status, and adjuvant treatment did not change the excess risk. The findings suggest that the types of p53 gene alterations may contribute to the racial difference in breast cancer survival",

    "Abstract": "Patients with a primary cancer in the lung or in the upper aerodigestive tract have an increased risk of developing synchronous or metachronous second primary lung tumors. This phenomenon has been related to the chronic exposure of the bronchial tree to carcinogens through a so-called 'field cancerization' process. This study was designed to investigate at the somatic level the genetic basis of the field cancerization effect in patients having multiple simultaneous neoplastic and preneoplastic lesions of the lung. The pattern of specific genetic changes occurring with high frequency and in early stages of lung carcinogenesis including p53 mutations, deletions of chromosome 3p, and K-ras mutations, was investigated by immunocytochemical, cytogenetic, and molecular approaches in 11 synchronous lesions of five patients with multiple lung cancers. Different genetic lesions were observed in all of the pathological specimens analyzed from each patient. The pattern of these changes was different both in topographically distant or adjacent lesions and in tumors with the same histopathological diagnosis supporting their independent origin. The present data provide further evidence of the clinical relevance of the field cancerization process, and support the use of genetic markers in the differential diagnosis of recurrence or metastasis versus second primaries of the lung",

    "Title": "Microsatellite alterations in adenoma and differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach",
    "Abstract": "In order to elucidate the significance of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in gastric carcinogenesis from a genetic point of view, we examined microsatellite alterations (replication error and loss of heterozygosity) on chromosomes 2p (D2S123), 3p (D3S1317), 5q (D5S409), 9p (IFNA), and 13q (D13S153) as well as p53 gene mutations in 13 adenomas and 23 differentiated adenocarcinomas including 8 early carcinomas of the stomach. Replication error was detected in only one of the adenomas (8%, 1/13) at the D5S409 locus and in none at the other loci, and loss of heterozygosity was also an infrequent event found in one adenoma (14%, 1/7 informative cases) at D5S409 and in none at the other loci. A p53 gene mutation was detected in one (8%, 1/13) of the adenomas. Thus, microsatellite alterations and p53 gene mutations are rare events in adenomas. In differentiated adenocarcinomas, replication error was detected in 4 (17%, 4/23) at single or multiple loci, and loss of heterozygosity was observed frequently at D3S1317 (25%, 3/12), D5S409 (67%, 6/9), and IFNA (26%, 5/19). Mutations in the p53 gene were detected in 9 (39%, 9/23) of the differentiated adenocarcinomas. Microsatellite alterations on several chromosomes and mutations in the p53 gene were frequent in differentiated adenocarcinomas, even those at an early stage. These results suggest that the adenoma-carcinoma sequence is relatively rare in gastric carcinogenesis, and that the majority of differentiated adenocarcinomas of the stomach may develop through a de novo pathway",

Two highly polymorphic dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms mapping to 17p13 were analyzed to assess the frequency of 17p allelic loss in these tumors. Mutations in the p53 gene were detected by direct DNA sequencing. Ninety-four % (15 of 16) of samples were informative at one or both polymorphic loci. Allelic loss at one or both loci was detected in 80% (12 of 15) of samples. Mutations were detected in 69% (11 of 16) esophageal adenocarcinomas, and there was a close association between 17p allelic loss and p53 gene mutation (P = 0.00879; Fisher's Exact Test). The tumors that were analyzed demonstrated a specific p53 mutation spectrum, with G:C to A:T base transitions at CpG dinucleotides accounting for 80% (8 of 10) of single-base substitutions. In three cases, the same p53 mutation was detected in both high-grade dysplasia and adjacent tumor. These results indicate that p53 gene alterations contribute to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma and precede the development of invasive carcinoma in patients with Barrett's esophagus",

Patient interviews revealed that, in addition to substantial exposure to solar UV radiation, most had a history of smoking and were exposed to carcinogens from industrial or agricultural sources.

We found that patients with tumors harboring mutated p53 genes showed a significantly poorer prognosis than did those patients with genes without point mutations, and, moreover, patient response to postoperative therapies depended significantly on mutation status in both adjuvant and palliative treatment cohorts. However, not all point mutations were the same functionally; point mutations within the conserved domains of the p53 tumor suppressor gene were inherently more aggressive thant tumors with point mutations outside of these domains, and mutations of codon 175 were particularly aggressive. These results suggest that knowledge of a patient's p53 status, both with respect to the presence of point mutation and to the specific nature of the lesion, may be required to accurately predict both the course of the disease and the response of the disease to postoperative therapeutic interventions, especially those therapies based on the induction of apoptosis in the neopastic cell.",

The lung cancer incidence for females in Hong Kong is unusually high, ranking among the highest in the world despite a low percentage with a history of smoking. To gain insights into possible etiological risk factors responsible for this high incidence, we examined p53 mutations in 35 lung cancer specimens from Chinese females living in Hong Kong and compared them with 35 matched cases from Japanese women as well as previously reported p53 mutations in the world literature. p53 mutations in exons 5-8 were present in 20 and 31% of the Hong Kong and Japanese cases, respectively. Notably, single-base deletions within runs of identical bases were observed in 3 (43%) of the 7 mutations in the Hong Kong cases, in contrast to the absence of such mutations in the controls and the extreme scarcity in the literature, suggesting that distinct environmental and/or genetic factor(s) might be involved. Although the frequent occurrence of characteristic single-base deletions could be a reflection of mutator mutations leading to inefficient mismatch repair of slipped strand mispairings, none of the lung cancer specimens exhibited such microsatellite instabilities",

The study was based on single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing of exons 2 through 11 of the p53 gene using DNA preparations from microdissected tumors. Mutations were found in 40% of the carcinomas (including a borderline component adjacent to carcinoma in one lesion) but in none of the pure BTs.

    "Title": "p53 mediated tumor cell response to chemotherapeutic DNA damage: a preliminary study in matched pairs of breast cancer biopsies",
    "Abstract": "Wild type p53 plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability in both normal and tumor cells in vitro. When DNA damage occurs, p53 acts as a cell cycle checkpoint and induces a cellular response that aims at restoring genomic integrity. p53 may either allow the repair of damaged DNA by inducing a transient G1 arrest or may eliminate the damaged cells by triggering apoptosis. Mutant p53 fails to mediate any of these effects. From this, a p53 status-dependent response to therapy might be expected when tumors are treated with DNA-damaging genotoxic agents: Although wild type p53-harboring tumors have an intact checkpoint that might allow them to restore genomic integrity back to a pre-exposure level, mutant p53 tumors have a corrupted checkpoint that could lead to an accelerated loss of genomic stability. Until now, no studies have been described that examine such a p53-mediated effect in vivo. The authors tested this response model in vivo comparing 32 matched biopsy pairs from patients with breast cancer before and after rigorously standardized polychemotherapy. Four of the five drugs specifically induce a wild type p53-mediated checkpoint response. Tumor tissue from matched pairs of untreated and treated biopsies of the same patient were analyzed for treatment-associated changes of p53 protein expression by immunocytochemistry and, in a few available specimens, of p53 genotype changes by polymerase chain reaction-based DNA analysis. Treatment-associated changes of the p53 immunophenotype, which the authors speculate to reflect clonal selection, occurred in 39% (12 of 31) of the specimens. One specimen was not informative. Most tumors undergoing clonal selection originally harbored mutant p53 (nine of 12), and only three of 12 tumors were wild type. This study shows that exposure to genotoxic agents is commonly associated with a change in p53 immunophenotype. Although the limited material in this cohort prevented direct analysis of genetic instability, these results suggest that tumors with altered p53 may be genomically less stable and, therefore, may be more likely to undergo treatment-induced clonal changes than wild type tumors. This study also shows that the rigorous matched sample approach, although difficult to obtain, is an important tool that allows the in vivo assessment of the tumor response to genotoxic therapy in a controlled fashion",

    "Abstract": "We examined 60 cases of human urothelial carcinomas (27 superficial and 33 deeply invasive) for the frequency of p53 gene mutations. Forty-two cases were analyzed by both the immunohistochemical and the single- strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) methods, and the remaining 18 cases were assayed by SSCP alone. For the latter assay, exons 4 to 8 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the amplified nucleotides were analyzed for the evidence of mutations by gel electrophoresis. When mobility shift was observed, direct nucleotide sequencing was performed to determine mutation sequence. Three superficial and eight deeply invasive carcinomas demonstrated evidence of mutations. Mutations involved various codons randomly. The fact that all tumors with mutations of the p53 gene except for one were of high nuclear grade (grade III) suggests that p53 mutation is associated with the progression of bladder cancers. Our results indicate that SSCP is a sensitive screening assay for detecting gene mutations. Immunohistochemical analysis is also a sensitive method but may yield false positive as well as false negative results",

The frequency of p53 alterations in this tumor is unknown. We analyzed 66 Wilms' tumor samples for p53 mutations by single-stand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) following polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Samples with an abnormal SSCP pattern were reamplified and analyzed by direct sequencing method. Mutations of p53 were found in three (5%) of 66 Wilms' tumors within the coding region (exons 2-11), showing that the frequency of p53 mutations was low. Two mutations substituted amino acids residues and one encoded a stop codon. Two of the mutations were located in the mutational hotspots (exons 5 and 6); the other was in exon 10.

From a total of 29 cases, 32 adenomas were endoscopically followed up more than 1 year and used in this study. Immunohistochemically, p53 positivity with diffuse or focal staining was observed in 12 of 32 adenomas. During the follow-up period, only four adenomas transformed to adenocarcinoma, of which three showed p53 positivity by immunohistochemistry. The mutation of the p53 gene in exon 5 through 8 was examined in 18 gastric adenomas including four adenomas with malignant transformation. The PCR-SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing revealed four missense mutations and one silent mutation in five adenomas. The missense mutation was present in three adenomas with diffuse p53 staining and in one adenoma with focal p53 staining. The predominant type of mutation was the G:C to A:T transition. In addition to the p53 gene analysis, Ki-ras gene was also investigated, but no mutation in codon 12 and 13 was found in the adenomas investigated. This study indicated that gastric adenomas might be one of the precursor lesions of gastric cancer but somewhat different from colon adenomas in regard to growth potential, p53 staining pattern and the rate of Ki-ras gene mutation",

    "Title": "p53 mutation in carcinomas arising in ovarian cystic teratomas",
    "Abstract": "Carcinomas arising in mature cystic teratomas of the ovaries from nine women were examined for the presence of p53 mutations. The nine tumors comprised six squamous cell carcinomas, one squamous cell carcinoma in situ, one undifferentiated small cell carcinoma, and one mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Abnormal nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein was observed in four of the tumors. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin- fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for specific amplification of the p53 gene exons 5- 8, followed by direct chemiluminescence sequencing analysis. A frameshift mutation in exon 8 (codon 278, CCT > del T; stop at codon 344) was detected in one poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The samples were also evaluated for the possible association of 'benign' and 'malignant' types of human papillomavirus (HPV) by PCR using universal primer sets. None of the samples contained detectable HPV genome. These data suggest that p53 mutations are relatively uncommon in secondary carcinomas developing in ovarian dermoid cysts, although the number of samples studied was admittedly small",

    "Title": "Alteration of the p53 gene of lung carcinomas with sarcomatous transformation (spindle cell carcinoma): analysis of four cases",
    "Abstract": "Lung carcinoma with sarcomatous transformation (LCST) is highly aggressive and characterized by local invasion and/or distant metastasis, which leeds to a shorter survival than ordinary lung carcinomas.  Therefore, to elucidate whether the malignant potential of the spindle cell element in LCST is associated with the alteration of the p53 gene, four cases were examined by analyses of overexpression of the p53 oncoprotein, mutation of the p53 gene and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 17p.  In two cases overexpression of the p53 oncoprotein of the spindle cell component showed a higher degree of staining than that of the carcinoma component; LOH was identified in both carcinoma and sarcomatous components in one case, while in contrast, another case showed lOH in the sarcomatous component only.  Mutations were clearly detected in two cases; one showed a CTT to CGT transversion in codon 194 of exon 6 in both components, whereas the other showed a CTG to CAG transversion in codon 265 of exon 8 in the sarcomatous component only.  On the basis of these observations, it suggested that the sarcomatous component shows a higher frequency of p53 gene abnormalities in comparison to the carcinoma component.  These results also suggested that the acquisition of malignant potential in the sarcomatous component or the morphological alteration of carcinoma cells, is correlated with abnormalities associated with the p53 gene.",

    "Title": "Heterogeneity in intratumor distribution of p53 mutations in human prostate cancer",
    "Abstract": "Prostatic carcinoma from 65 patients have been examined for the occurrence of point mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene locus within the region of exons 5 to 8. Overall, only a small fraction of tumors (12.3%) was found to contain p53 mutations. No significant correlation was detected between the presence of the mutant gene and either tumor volume or histopathological grade. However, metastatic prostatic tumors are found to display a higher percentage (21.4%) of p53 mutations compared with primary adenocarcinomas (9.8%). Analysis of the topographical distribution of the p53 mutant genotype revealed two remarkable findings. First, multifocal tumors within a prostate appear to differ in harboring the mutant gene, and second, evidence is obtained for intratumor heterogeneity in the distribution of the mutant p53 allele. Together these findings appear to explain, at least in part, why there has been a wide discrepancy in the reported detection frequency of p53 mutations in prostate cancer specimens. It appears that the outcome of mutation analysis would depend not only on which tumors but also which regions of the tumors are included in the study. Furthermore, the observed heterogeneous topographical distribution of the mutation, if confirmed to be unique to prostate cancer, may have important implications in the understanding of the biology of prostate carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Intratumor cellular heterogeneity and alterations in ras oncogene and p53 tumor suppressor gene in human prostate carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "To assess the potential role of ras oncogene activation and p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations in the development of human prostate carcinoma, nine cases of histologically heterogeneous prostate tumors obtained from total prostatectomies were probed for these specific events. Each tumor was divided into 5 to 10 areas according to different growth or histological patterns. Targeted DNA sequences coding for ras and p53 were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, analyzed by single-strand conformational polymorphisms, and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Point mutations of the ras gene were found in three of the nine tumors. Two contained K-ras codon 13 and H-ras codon 61 mutations, found in only one and three areas of each lesion, respectively. The third tumor contained two different point mutations in K-ras codons 13 and 61 in different foci of the sample. Loss of heterozygosity at the polymorphic codon 72 in the p53 gene was detected in two of four informative cases (50%) showing fragment cleavage by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Mutations in p53, missense transversions, single base insertions, and two base deletions were also detected in three tumors. The present results reveal mutated ras and p53 occasionally occurring in small foci of the tumor and that genetic mutations in p53, as opposed to those in ras, are more closely associated with invasive growth of heterogeneous prostate carcinoma",

We detected three cases (16.7%) with the p53 gene mutations showing only the mutant alleles; the high incidence in cases with loss of a whole chromosome 17 (two of three) contrasted with the low incidence in cases without abnormalities of chromosome 17 (one of 15). These cases containing the mutations of the p53 gene showed a poor prognosis. Although we analyzed a rather small series of patients, these findings suggest that the p53 gene mutations might be involved in the progression and prognosis of at least some cases of AML",

    "Title": "Mutation of the p53 gene precedes aneuploid clonal divergence in colorectal carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "To establish whether p53 mutation precedes or follows clonal divergence in human colorectal carcinomas, 17 tumours were analysed at multiple sites (2-5 each) for single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP) within exons 5-8 of the p53 gene. A previous study had demonstrated subclones of differing DNA ploidy in these tumours, but all showed immunocytochemical evidence for p53 stabilisation, using the monoclonal antibody PAb 1801. Mutations within exons 5-8 of p53 were identified by the presence of an abnormally migrating band in 10 of the 17 carcinomas: five in exon 5, four in exon 7 and one in exon 8. In each of these positive cases, samples from different parts of the carcinoma showed identical gel migration patterns in SSCP analysis. Similarly, the remaining seven tumours were concordant for absence of band shift across all samples of each tumour. Six SSCP-positive cases contained multiple populations differing in DNA ploidy, while four were homogeneously diploid or aneuploid throughout. Very similar proportions were observed in the SSCP-negative cases. In four positive tumours the mutation was confirmed by sequencing or through alteration of nucleotide-specific restriction enzyme cleavage. Identical mutations appeared in every sample from the same tumour. The results provide unequivocal evidence that the same mutant allele of p53 is present throughout each tumour bearing a mutation, regardless of the clonal variation identified by analysis of DNA ploidy. We conclude that in colorectal tumorigenesis mutation of p53 occurs as a single event which precedes and may facilitate the aneuploid clonal divergence of carcinomas",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the association between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and p53 gene mutation in 47 primary uterine cervical cancers. HPV DNA sequences were present in 43 cancers (91.5%), and one of these cancers contained a p53 gene mutation. In addition, one of the remaining four HPV-negative cancers also contained a p53 gene mutation. As a result, p53 inactivation corresponded to the development of 44 of the primary uterine cervical cancers studied (93.6%). We obtained both primary and recurrent tumours from four cases. In two of these cases, the HPV genomes that were present in an episomal state in the primary tumours were observed to have disappeared in the recurrent tumours. One of these recurrent tumours also contained a p53 gene mutation, which suggested the possibility that p53 inactivation was required in order to maintain the aggressive behaviour in this cancer either by an HPV infection or by a p53 gene mutation. No MDM2 gene amplification was observed in the tumours that carried neither HPV DNAs nor p53 gene mutations",

Immunoreactivity was found in 64% and p53 gene mutations in 39% of the tumours. Thirty-three per cent of the immunopositive and 50% of the immunonegative tumours were mutated within exons 5-8. In one immunopositive tumour three variants of deletions were observed. Sequencing of the p53 mutated, immunonegative tumours revealed four cases with deletions, one case with a transversion resulting in a stop codon and one case with a splice site mutation which could result in omission of the following exon at splicing. All mutations in the immunonegative tumours resulted in a truncated p53 protein. No association between p53 gene status and expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) or cell proliferation as judged by in vivo incorporation of the thymidine analogue iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) was found",

    "Abstract": "In the present study, we analysed human choriocarcinoma cell lines for abnormalities in the tumour-suppressor gene p53 by Southern blotting, Northern blotting, non-radioisotopic single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and complementary DNA sequencing. In all cell lines (Bewo, GCH-1, GCH-2, SCH, JAR, JEG-3, NUC-1 and HCCM-5), no p53 gene abnormality was detected by using Southern blotting. p53 mRNA of the expected size was detected in all cell lines tested by Northern blotting. SSCP analysis revealed abnormalities of p53 cDNA in the SCH cell line. Sequencing analysis of the entire coding region of the p53 gene revealed that both alleles were expressed in the JEG-3 cell line, and one of the alleles contained a point mutation (G to T) in codon 167 (Gln to His). In the NUC-1 cell line both alleles were point mutated. One allele had a point mutation (A to T) that resulted in a codon 17 change (Glu to Asp), and another had a point mutation (A to T) that caused a codon 24 change (Lys to Asn). In the SCH cell line, AGG was inserted between codon 249 and 250; this insertion resulted in an abnormal structure of the p53 protein. In three out of eight human choriocarcinoma cell lines, a p53 gene abnormality was detected. Therefore our data demonstrate that p53 gene abnormalities are associated with choriocarcinoma cell lines",

    "Abstract": "Mutation and abnormal expression of p53 was studied in 38 lymphomas [five Hodgkin's disease and 33 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)]. CM1 polyclonal antibody was used to detect overexpression of p53. Three missense mutations were characterised in three cases of NHL after screening exons 5-8 of p53 of all the tumours with single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Only two out of three tumours with a missense mutation showed abnormal expression of p53 as measured by CM1. Conversely, seven out of nine tumours with positive CM1 staining had no point mutation demonstrated. Overexpression of p53 in the cases of NHL occurred in three out of twenty four low-grade tumours and five out of nine high-grade tumours (Kiel classification). The results suggest that abnormalities of p53 are commoner in high- grade than low-grade NHL, and that positive immunocytochemistry cannot be used to determine which tumours have mutations of p53",

    "Abstract": "Analysis of human tumour-derived cell lines has previously resulted in the identification of novel transformation-related elements and provided a useful tool for functional studies of different genes. To establish the utility of such cell lines as indicators of change relevant to urothelial cancer, we have characterised the expression of five genes (p53, MDM2, Rb, E-cadherin, APC) within a panel of human bladder carcinoma cell lines. Using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing, p53 mutations were identified in 7/15 (47%) cell lines reflecting events reported in bladder tumours. Immunohistochemical analysis of p53 in cultured cells and in paraffin-embedded sections of xenografts from the cell line panel revealed discordant results. An absence of p53 nuclear staining was associated with an exon 5 mutation in EJ and with multiple p53 mutations found in J82. Two cell lines positive for p53 staining in the absence of detectable mutation displayed overexpression of MDM2 (PSI, HT1197) in Western blot analysis. Loss or aberrant Rb expression was recorded in 5/15 (TCCSUP, SCaBER, 5637, HT1376, J82) cell lines. Absence of E-cadherin was recorded in 5/15 cell lines (TCCSUP, EJ, KK47, UM-UC-3, J82) with loss of alpha-catenin in immunoprecipitated E- cadherin complexes of CUBIII. Western blot analysis of APC revealed a truncated protein in 1/15 (CUBIII) cell lines. The characterisation of oncogenic events within this panel of human bladder carcinoma cell lines establishes a representation of change observed in bladder tumours and better defines the genotypic background in these experimental human cell models of neoplastic progression",

Six of these tumours (22%) contained mutations: four were found in exon 5 and two in exon 8. A total of 50% of the primary vaginal carcinomas carried a TP53 alteration.

    "Title": "MDM2 overexpression is rare in ovarian carcinoma irrespective of TP53 mutation status",
    "Abstract": "Somatic mutations in TP53 are seen in many human cancers. In addition, the protein product of the wild-type TP53 can be sequestered by the protein MDM2 (murine double minute 2). This protein is commonly overexpressed in human sarcomas and gliomas, usually as a result of gene amplification. In this study, 43 ovarian carcinomas (OCs) were analysed for aberrations in the TP53 gene by immunohistochemistry (IHC), loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or mutation analysis. The MDM2 gene and its product was studied by Southern blotting and IHC. Over 50% of the OCs studied showed mutations in TP53 by either direct sequencing (19/36, 53%), positive IHC (23,43, 53%) or both, whereas 0/32 had amplification of MDM2 and only 1/37 tumours had positive IHC using the anti-MDM2 antibody IF-2. The solitary example of positive IHC in this series was seen in a mixed mullerian tumour with sarcomatous differentiation and was not accompanied by MDM2 DNA amplification. These results support previous data showing that around 50% of OCs have mutations in TP53 and in addition, suggest that MDM2 is not amplified in OC, but the presence of sarcomatous features in mixed mullerian tumours may result in positive immunohistochemistry with IF-2",

Neither was found in non-cancerous lesions. The results indicate that mutation of both genes may not be so frequent among Japanese patients. They were found only in very few cancerous lesions of each patient. Therefore, it is possible that the oncogenic process in each lesion is a consequence of rather independent events.

    "Title": "Growth factor requirement, oncogene expression and TP53 mutations of a tumorigenic and a non-tumorigenic subline of the human breast carcinoma cell line, HMT-3909",
    "Abstract": "From a human breast carcinoma cell line, HMT-3909, a tumorigenic and a non-tumorigenic subline have previously been described. Cells of both sublines have been characterised as carcinoma cells. In the present work we examined whether differences in growth factor requirements or oncogene expression may explain the difference in tumorigenicity. We found that exogenous growth factor dependence discriminated between the two sublines. No alterations in oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes were demonstrated that could explain the differences in tumorigenicity. The lower growth factor requirement and the higher growth rate of the tumorigenic subline indicates that, in these cells, growth potential may determine the outcome of the tumorigenicity assay",

    "Abstract": "To determine the frequency and type of TP53 mutations in human sarcomas, we examined exons 5-8 of the TP53 gene in 48 sarcomas using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing. Nine tumours had mobility-shifts on SSCP analysis, and sequencing of six of these tumours revealed 10 mutations: one insertion, two deletions and seven point mutations (four transitions and three transversions). Four of these mutations resulted in frame- shifts, one in a truncated protein, four cases in mono-allelic point mutations and one case in an altered splice site. These data show that approximately 20% of sarcomas harbour TP53 gene alterations and illustrate a variety of TP53 gene mutation types",

    "Title": "TP53 mutations and abnormal p53 protein staining in breast carcinomas related to prognosis",
    "Abstract": "Abnormalities in the TP53 tumour suppressor gene were evaluated in 106 unselected breast carcinomas and compared to clinical outcome of the disease. Tumours were screened for p53 abnormalities using immunohistochemical staining and polymerase chain reaction-constant denaturant gel electrophoresis (PCR-CDGE) analysis, followed by PCR and direct sequencing. Allelic loss at the TP53 locus was determined with polymorphic markers by comparing normal and tumour DNA. For approximately half of the patients, abnormal p53 protein expression in serum was determined by an ELISA assay. p53 abnormalities, detected as mutations and/or nuclear staining, were found in 37.6 (38/101) of cases. Nuclear staining for p53 protein could be identified in 33.7% of the tumours. Mutations in exons 5-8 were detected in 18.9% of the tumours, and an association was found between mutations and nuclear staining. Allelic loss in the TP53 region on 17p was more frequent in tumours showing changes in the TP53 gene (72.7%) compared to tumours with no mutation (45.8%). Serum levels of p53 antibodies showed no association with either TP53 mutations or nuclear staining. Women with TP53 mutations in their tumours had an elevated risk of dying during the study period (RR (relative risk) = 3.4, P = 0.014). The effects of p53 positive staining were similar (RR = 3.2, P = 0.013). Considering all abnormalities, mutation and/or staining, the relative risk of dying from breast cancer was 3.5 (P = 0.008)",

    "Title": "Mutations clustered in exon 5 of the p53 gene in primary nasopharyngeal carcinomas from southeastern Asia",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene play an important role in the development of many common human malignancies. In nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC), p53 gene mutations were not detected in primary tumors, with one exception for a primary tumor displaying a p53 mutation at codon 280, whereas p53 mutations were identified in some metastatic and nude mouse-passaged NPC specimens. In the present report, 41 NPC primary tumors of the undifferentiated carcinoma nasopharyngeal type (UCNT; 21 from Hong Kong and 20 from Guangxi, southeastern China) were studied. Four point mutations that result in amino acid substitutions were identified by PCR amplification of exons 2-9 and direct DNA sequencing, combined with PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. The 4 mutations detected were clustered within the DNA stretch from codon 175 to 177. Our data, taken together with those of others, suggest that mutation in p53 may occur in NPC at various points during tumorigenesis. Alternative mechanisms of p53 inactivation in NPC are also possible",

    "Title": "Analysis of the p53 gene in relation to tobacco and alcohol in cancers of the upper aero-digestive tract",
    "Abstract": "To elucidate the relationship, if any, of p53 gene expression according to smoking and drinking habits, 135 subjects with cancer of the upper aero-digestive tract were sampled from a case-control investigation conducted in Pordenone province, Northeast Italy, between 1986 and 1991. Adequate pathological material for immunohistochemical analysis was available for 83 subjects. Level of p53 expression was classified according to intensity on immunoreaction and percentage of p53-positive cells. Mutations were analyzed by means of single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing in 8 p53-positive life-long non-smokers exposed to various levels of alcohol intake. The association between p53 expression and smoking status and alcohol intake was evaluated by means of odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals. Significantly, more men (39/65) than women (6/18) had elevated p53 expression. No significant trend of increasing percentage of p53-positive cancers with increasing smoking and drinking level was detected, especially after allowance for gender. With respect to specific mutation pattern, in 8 life-long non smokers who drank alcohol, 6 mutations involved G:C base pairs. G-to-A transitions were identified in 4 cases. The present study does not support an association between elevated p53 expression and tobacco smoking or alcohol intake. It provides an example of a molecular biology study in the framework of a large epidemiological investigation",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in ovarian tumors, detected by temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis, direct sequencing and immunohistochemistry",
    "Abstract": "Samples from 94 ovarian tumors, comprising 24 cystadenomas/adenofibromas, among them 6 benign and 18 borderline tumors, one benign Brenner tumor, 39 carcinomas, 17 sex-cord stromal tumors, 5 germ-cell tumors and 8 metastatic or recurrent neoplasms were screened for p53 aberrations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE), direct sequencing and immunohistochemistry. All sex-cord stromal and germ-cell tumors showed wild-type p53, except for a heterozygous silent germ-line mutation in one androblastoma. Somatic p53 mutations were detected in only one tumor of the cystadenoma/adenofibroma series (4.2%), in contrast to 38.5% of the carcinomas, among them 57.1% of serous papillary carcinomas, and 12.5 to 22.2% of endometrioid and mucinous carcinomas. By direct sequencing, the mutations of 13 cases were qualified as mis- sense mutations (n = 10), or 1 to 2-bp deletions (n = 3). Only 2 cases were immunohistochemically positive in the absence of detectable p53- gene abnormalities. The presence of p53 aberrations was significantly correlated with high grade, but not with stage of disease. For 21 bilateral tumors and/or tumors spread to the peritoneum, samples from both ovaries and/or ascites were analyzed. Among these, 16 cases were identical as to the p53 genotype, 5 cases showed discordant p53 states in ovary and/or in ascites DNA. We conclude that somatic p53 mutations are very frequent in serous papillary carcinomas, particularly in tumors of high grade, bilaterality, and peritoneal spread, less frequent in other carcinoma types and extremely rare in borderline and benign tumors of the ovary",

    "Title": "A low incidence of p53 mutations in pre-malignant lesions of the oral cavity from non-tobacco users",
    "Abstract": "To determine the incidence of p53 mutations in pre-malignant lesions of the oral cavity from individuals without prior history of tobacco use, we have analyzed the conserved regions of the p53 gene (exons 5-9) in archival oral cavity lesion specimens obtained from patients with varied tobacco use histories, by polymerase chain reaction/single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) and DNA sequencing analysis. Twenty-six lesions were analyzed from 14 patients, with multiple lesions obtained from 8 patients. Six of these patients used tobacco, (3 being cigarette smokers, 1 ex-cigarette smoker, 1 moderate cigar smoker and 1 snuff chewer). The remaining 8 patients had no prior history of tobacco use. Thirteen of the pre-malignant lesions exhibited severe dysplasia, 9 exhibited moderate dysplasia and 4 exhibited mild dysplasia. Four of the 26 lesions exhibited p53 mutations, each being from a tobacco user. None of the 13 lesions from never-tobacco users exhibited p53 mutations. There was a significantly higher p53 mutation incidence in pre-malignant lesions from tobacco users (including ex- smokers) than in non-tobacco users as well as in cigarette smokers plus snuff chewers than in non-tobacco users. Two of the mutations were observed in lesions exhibiting severe dysplasia: 1 in a lesion exhibiting moderate dysplasia and 1 in a lesion exhibiting mild dysplasia. These data suggest that p53 mutation may be a very early event in oral cavity tumor progression and demonstrate that pre- malignant lesions obtained from non-tobacco users do not exhibit p53 mutations",

Mutations were identified by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing in 50% of the specimens. Eleven tumors harbored a single base-pair substitution leading to either an amino-acid substitution (8 tumors) or a chain-termination signal (3 tumors), and one tumor revealed a 15-bp deletion in exon 7 with a silent base substitution adjacent to the deletion site. Mutations occurred in all 4 exons examined, with a preponderance in exon 5. Of the 6 mutations identified among the 14 adenocarcinomas examined, 3 were G to T transversions, a mutation that has thus far been absent from reported mutations in Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinomas and dysplasias from patients residing in Europe and North America",

    "Title": "ras, p53 and HPV status in benign and malignant prostate tumors",
    "Abstract": "To study the role of ras, p53 genes and HPV virus (16 and 18) in the development of prostate cancer, we analyzed tissue sections from 27 patients affected with carcinomas (stages A to D) and from 24 patients with adenomas. Mutations of H, K and N-ras and p53 (exons 2-9) were studied by SSCP and DNA sequencing. Accumulation of p53 protein was studied by immunohistochemistry on tissue sections. Tumors were also analyzed for the presence of HPV16 and -18 sequences by PCR and DNA hybridization with sequence-specific oligonucleotides. No mutation was found in the three ras genes studied, either in carcinomas or adenomas. By SSCP analysis we identified p53 mutations in only 2 of 19 carcinomas studied, both in exon 7. Immunohistochemical results strongly correlate with the SSCP results: p53 protein was positive in tumors with p53 mutation but not in others; 32% of studied adenomas had detectable HPV16 DNA, while 53% of carcinomas were HPV16+. Among these I presented a p53 mutation. No HPV18 E6 sequence could be detected. Our data show that in prostate tumors from France, mutations of p53 and ras are rare events but that these tumors display detectable HPV16 DNA at a high frequency. The low incidence of p53 mutation, associated to a significant proportion of tumors showing HPV16 DNA, could suggest that in prostate cancer HPV16 infection could participate in p53 inactivation by E6",

    "Title": "The mutational status of p53 protein in gastric and esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines predicts sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents",
    "Abstract": "Resistance to chemotherapy remains a serious problem in the successful treatment of gastric and esophageal cancers. DNA-damaging agents alter levels of p53 protein in several cell types and it has been speculated that regulation of p53 can be involved in the resistance or sensitivity of cancer cells to some chemotherapeutic drugs, depending on whether cells have mutant or wild-type p53; however, little is known about the relationship of p53 to drug sensitivity in gastric/esophageal cancers. Here we have examined human gastric/esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines for p53 mutational status, chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II), alteration in p53 levels following exposure of cells to these drugs, and the mechanisms involved in regulating p53 levels. Our results indicate that wild-type p53 protein levels increase after treatment with each of these drugs via either post-translational and/or translational mechanisms and that this increase in wild-type p53 appears to be required for effective chemotherapeutic growth control of gastric/esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. In contrast, gastric/esophageal cancer cells expressing either mutated p53 protein or no p53 protein are more resistant to the growth- inhibitory effects of these drugs, despite the fact that drug exposure can also increase mutant p53 levels by a translational mechanism. Thus, these data indicate that the mutational status of p53 is predictive of chemosensitivity of gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas, and suggest a mechanism in which p53 protein contributes to the cellular response to chemotherapy",

    "Title": "A mutational hot spot in the p53 gene is associated with hepatoblastomas",
    "Abstract": "Hepatoblastomas generally appear in children aged 2 or 3 years old and arise from apparently normal, non-cirrhotic liver. To elucidate any possible role of p53 mutations in their genesis, we amplified and sequenced exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene in 10 cases of hepatoblastoma. Somatic mutations were detected in 9 cases, in eight of which a common point mutation at the first-base position of codon 157 was found, resulting in an amino-acid substitution of phenylalanine for valine. Two missense mutations in codon 244, and one each in codons 273 and 279, were also found, with 3 hepatoblastomas having double mis-sense mutations. Out of the total of 12 mutations, 11 were G-to-T transversions. One was a G-to-A transition and guanines were always present on the transcribed strand. Furthermore, p53 over-expression was immunohistochemically observed in 7 out of 9 cases with p53 gene mutations, although the staining pattern was focal and heterogeneous. The findings suggest that particular environmental mutagens may be involved in mutagenesis of the p53 gene in some cases of hepatoblastomas and that p53 mutations at a specific site may play an important role in the genesis of this disease",

    "Title": "Comparative analysis of p53 gene mutations and protein accumulation in human non-small-cell lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "A series of 54 resected primary non-small-cell lung carcinomas was analyzed for p53 gene mutations and for p53 protein accumulation and the findings were correlated with clinical parameters. Mutations in exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene were identified by a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) assay and cycle sequencing, whereas p53 protein accumulation was detected in paraffin-embedded tissue by immunostaining using 2 different murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (BP53-12 and DO7). A p53 gene mutation and/or p53 protein accumulation was found in 37 of 54 tumors. Mis-sense mutations were closely associated with positive immunostaining, which was intense in 15 out of 17 cases with a mutation. In 10 tumors, obvious p53 accumulation was detected in the absence of mutations in exons 5 through 8. Conversely, only one of 8 p53 non-sense mutations led to detectable p53 accumulation. The most frequent single base changes were G --> T transversions and C --> T transitions. The presence of a p53 alteration was not related to age, tumor size, stage or histology. However, we found a significant inverse correlation between p53 alterations and the presence of a K-ras mutation. This was reflected in the overall postoperative survival data: patients with p53 alterations in their tumors tended to have a better prognosis than those without a p53 alteration; however, this difference was lost when cases with a K-ras mutation were omitted from the analysis",

    "Title": "Sequential p53 mutation analysis of pre-invasive and invasive head and neck squamous carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing were performed on uninvolved mucosa, severe dysplasia and invasive carcinoma samples from 20 patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma. Seven (35%) of the non-invasive lesions and 15 (75%) of the invasive carcinomas manifested p53 mutations. Although the majority of mutations were mis-sense, resulting in single amino acid substitution, a silent mutation encoding for the same amino acid and 2 non-sense mutations encoding a stop codon were also observed. Mutations in invasive carcinoma were mostly in exon 8 and involved codons 296, 288 and 298; non-invasive lesions showed more mutations at exons 5 to 7. Five lesions showed simultaneous mutations in 2 different exons; in 3 both non-invasive and invasive carcinomas showed primary mutation at exons 5 to 7, and invasive carcinoma showed a secondary mutation at exon 8. Different codon mutations in the same exon between dysplastic and the corresponding carcinoma samples were found in 2 cases. p53 alterations were not observed in any of the normal mucosa samples. No apparent association between p53 mutations and conventional clinicopathologic parameters, including DNA content, was found in this cohort. Our study indicates that (i) p53 alteration is an early event in the genesis of a subset of head and neck squamous carcinomas, (ii) normal mucosa within the resected specimens lacked p53 mutation, (iii) sequential mutations of different exons of the p53 gene suggests accumulation of genetic alterations during the neoplastic transformation of these lesions and (iv) the difference in codon mutation of the same exon between dysplastic and corresponding carcinoma suggests an independent clonal development",

    "Abstract": "Twenty-one invasive squamous-cell carcinomas (SCC) of the bladder from Schistosoma-hematobium-infected patients were examined immunohistochemically for the expression of p53, Rb, EGFR and c-erbB-2 proteins; and screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing for mutations in the ras (H, N, K) codon hotspots (12, 13, 61) and p53 (exons 4-9) genes. Positive staining for p53, EGFR and c- erbB-2 was reported in 38, 67 and 28% of tumors respectively. Only one of the tumors, the only one that was poorly differentiated, displayed an absence of nuclear Rb staining. Ras alterations were detected in the H-ras gene in 3 tumors, 2 of which harbored a codon-13 (Gly-->Arg) and one a codon-12 (Gly-->Ser) point mutation. p53 mutations were recorded in 12 tumors (57%), 6 of which stained positively for p53. Four tumors had exon-7 mutations (codons 235, 241 and 249; one tumor had 2 exon-7 mutations). Eight tumors were mutated in exon 8 (codons 264, 271, 273, 285, 286, 288 and 294), 5 of which harbored multiple mutations. One tumor had an insertion/deletion event in exon 9. The frequency of detection of over-expression of EGFR and c-erbB-2 in bilharzial-bladder lesions is comparable to that reported in TCC, contrasting with the infrequent loss of Rb expression found in invasive lesions associated with schistosomiasis infection. However, the detection of multiple p53 mutations in these lesions is suggestive of the involvement of a carcinogenic agent with maintenance of preferential activation of the H- ras gene",

    "Abstract": "In a previous registry-based survey of 999 patients injected with alpha- emitting 232ThO2 (Thorotrast), we identified elevated risks for lung carcinoma and malignant mesothelioma. Since injected Thorotrast is retained lifelong mostly in liver, spleen and lymph nodes, the mesothelial surfaces of these organs are constantly irradiated. Thorotrast-administered patients also perpetually exhale 220Rn, a 232Th- daughter. Study of Thorotrast-exposed patients may, therefore, provide data with regard to carcinogenicity of radon exposure, a current public health concern, as well as the pathogenesis of malignant mesothelioma. The incidence and histologic types of lung carcinoma and malignant mesothelioma within the cohort were examined by review of available histopathologic material and medical records. Further, mutations of the p53 gene were analyzed whenever possible as it has previously been suggested that radon-associated lung carcinomas exhibit specific mutational patterns. The cumulative risk for lung carcinoma reached 11.0% based on 20 confirmed cases. Nine were small cell lung cancer (SCLC), whereas the expected frequency was 18%. The risk for malignant mesothelioma reached 2.5% based on 7 cases. The actuarial risk of malignant mesothelioma for patients given more than 20 ml Thorotrast was 7.8% compared to 1.4% for patients administered smaller amounts. Seven lung carcinomas and 5 malignant mesotheliomas were analyzed for p53 mutations; only 1 (in a lung adenocarcinoma) was detected. A possible association between Thorotrast and SCLC is suggested. In addition, a possible dose-response gradient exists for Thorotrast and malignant mesothelioma",

    "Abstract": "Ninety-eight cases of transitional-cell carcinoma (TCC) of the renal pelvis and ureter, including dysplastic lesions, were studied for tumor incorporation of human papillomavirus (HPV) type-16 and type-18 DNA by in situ hybridization (ISH) with DNA probes for each HPV viral type. Immunohistochemical analysis of p53 expression was also performed. Fresh tumor tissues from 26 patients were also studied for p53 mutations in exons 4 through 9 by direct sequencing and for HPV infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thirty-two tumors were positive for HPV DNAs, including 6 double-positive cases. Among these tumors, adjacent dysplastic lesions in 21 cases (66%) also revealed identical reactivity. Overexpressed p53 was detected in 26 cases. Expression of p53 was also detected in dysplastic lesions in 19 out of these 26 cases (73%). Three cases were positive for both HPV DNA and p53 antibody. p53 point mutation was detected in 7 of 26 cases, 6 of which were also positive for p53. HPV type-16 DNA was detected in 6 cases by PCR, 4 of which were also ISH-positive. Overexpressed p53 was frequently detected in invasive and non-papillary tumors (p < 0.01) and in high-grade tumors (p < 0.05). HPV infection was more common in non- invasive and papillary tumors (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that HPV infection or overexpression (mutation) of p53 may be an early event and be related to phenotypes of tumor-cell growth patterns and progression",

    "Title": "Detection of TP53 gene mutation in human meningiomas: a study using immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing techniques on paraffin- embedded samples",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene have been studied in different types of brain tumors. Little is known about this genetic event in human meningioma, a mostly benign tumor. To investigate the frequency of TP53 gene mutations in human tumors derived from meningeal tissues, paraffin-embedded tissues from 30 cases (including 2 malignant and 4 atypical meningiomas, as well as 2 hemangioblastomas and 3 hemangiopericytomas) were screened by immunohistochemistry. Polymerase chain reaction/single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) and direct DNA sequencing were thereafter performed in selected cases. Nuclear p53 staining was not seen in any of the 19 benign meningiomas tested, while atypical meningiomas, hemangioblastomas, and hemangiopericytomas displayed nuclear staining in a subpopulation of tumor cells in 4 out of 5, 2 out of 2, and 3 out of 3 cases, respectively. One malignant meningioma showed an intense nuclear staining and a band shift in SSCP. In this case, we identified a mutation in the TP53 gene at codon 161 changing GCC to ACC and resulting in an alteration of alanine to threonine in this position. Our results indicate that TP53 gene mutation may be considered as a marker for malignant transformation in meningioma. p53 immunoreactivity, even in the absence of detectable gene mutation, is also associated with atypia and does not appear in regular benign meningiomas",

    "Title": "TP53 and RAS mutations in metachronous tumors from patients with cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract",
    "Abstract": "Patients who initially develop an upper aerodigestive tract cancer have an increased risk of second primary cancers. We examined TP53 and RAS mutations and p53 protein in 21 tumors from 10 patients with upper aerodigestive tract cancer who developed a metachronous tumor, to assess the genetic changes that occur in multiple primary tumors from the same individual. Thirteen of 21 (62%) tumors were found to have mis-sense mutations of either TP53 or RAS. Six tumors had TP53 mutations in codons 5 to 8 and 10 tumors from 7 patients had mutations of codons 12 or 13 of K-RAS. Only one patient had concordance of a mutation in 2 tumors; this mutation occurred in K-RAS and was accompanied by discordance of TP53 mutation. Three patients had tumors discordant forboth TP-53 and RAS mutations. Smoking-related tumors had TP53 and RAS mutations which were transversions in 11 (9 G:C to T:A and 2 G:C to C:G) and transitions in 3 (G:C to A:T and 1 A:T to G:C). Tumors not associated with smoking contained only transitions (both G:C to A:T) p53 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry in 7 of 13 (54%) tumors and was concordant in the multiple tumors of 3 patients. Three of the 7 tumors staining for p53 also had TP-53 mutations. Thus, genetic alterations are discordant in multiple primary cancers and the pattern of mutations is similar to that found in patients with a single primary tumor, supporting the concept that these cancers arise independently.",

    "Abstract": "This study examined the sensitivity and specificity of serum auto- antibodies to p53 protein as a non-invasive marker of p53 genetic alterations or protein accumulation in lung cancer cases. A sensitive ELISA to detect serum p53 antibodies was developed and used to examine sera from 186 patients undergoing pulmonary surgery for a suspected lung cancer. Target antigens in ELISA were wild-type p53 protein and 5 peptides covering the N- and C-terminal parts of the protein. Sixteen sera were positive for serum p53 antibodies in both ELISAs and all were among the 136 patients with confirmed primary lung carcinoma. Of 50 patients with other pulmonary diseases, none had p53 antibodies. In 92 cancer patients exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were examined for mutations by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing of PCR products. Forty-seven tumours had a p53 mutation and 7 (15.2%) of these were positive for p53 antibodies. Two patients had serum antibodies but no detectable mutation in exons 5 to 8. Frequencies of p53 mutations and serum antibodies were higher in squamous cell carcinoma patients than in adenocarcinoma. Accumulation of p53 protein in tumour tissue was observed in 32 patients, but only 5 were positive for p53 antibodies. In conclusion, serum p53 antibodies were detected only in a proportion of lung cancer cases, but the majority were specifically associated with a detectable p53 mutation in the tumour",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To correlate the presence of p53 mutations and initial characteristics, response to chemotherapy, and survival in newly diagnosed Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and Burkitt's acute lymphoblastic leukemia (L3 ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with newly diagnosed BL or L3 ALL, most of whom were treated with very intensive regimens, including early CNS disease treatment, were studied. Detection of p53 mutations was made by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 5 to 8 of the gene, and mutations were determined by direct sequencing of exons with abnormal SSCP findings. Comparison of outcome between mutated and nonmutated cases was made in all patients and also after excluding five patients who received therapeutic regimens considered as suboptimal and one patient who died of AIDS while in complete remission (CR), as those six patients had no p53 mutations. RESULTS: A point mutation was found in nine patients (19%), and consisted of a missense mutation in seven and a chain-terminating mutation in two. SSCP, sequence, and cytogenetic analysis strongly suggested that eight of nine patients with mutations had retained the normal p53 allele, which had been lost in the remaining patient. These findings were confirmed by fluorescence- in-situ hybridization (FISH) with a p53-specific probe in two patients, including the one who had lost the normal p53 allele. Unexpectedly, mutations were significantly less frequent in patients with disseminated disease, ie, L3 ALL or stage IV BL (four of 35, 11%), than in more localized forms, ie, BL stage I, II, or III (five of 13, 38%) (P = .03). CR rates were similar in mutated (78%) and nonmutated cases (78%). The actuarial disease-free interval (DFI) after 12 months and actuarial survival rates after 24 months were 49% and 66%, respectively, in patients with mutations, and 73% and 48%, respectively, those without mutations. The differences were not significant. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that, contrary to what is seen in most other neoplasias, p53 mutations in newly diagnosed BL and L3 ALL are not associated with extensive tumor mass or poor response to intensive therapeutic regimens. It is hypothesized that this difference with most tumors could be due to the fact that p53 mutations in BL and L3 ALL are generally associated with persistence of a normal residual p53 allele, contrary to what is observed in the majority of tumors",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in benign breast tissue",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Patients with benign breast biopsies that exhibit atypical epithelial proliferation or fibroadenoma may be at increased risk for invasive breast cancer. We hypothesized that molecular markers might also be useful to evaluate the malignant potential of nonneoplastic breast tissue. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study subjects belonged to a cohort of 6,805 women who underwent biopsy for nonmalignant breast disease at the Mayo Clinic and Rochester-affiliated hospitals between 1967 and 1981. As part of a nested case-control study that compared subjects who developed invasive breast cancer with those who did not, we analyzed a sample of 60 benign breast biopsies for the following markers: HER-2/neu and p53 over-expression by immunohistochemistry, HER- 2/neu and PRAD-1 amplification using differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and p53 mutation using single-strand conformation analysis (SSCA) and direct DNA sequencing by asymmetric PCR. RESULTS: None of 60 biopsies showed amplification of HER-2/neu or PRAD-1. Five samples exhibited low-level immunoreactivity to the HER-2/neu protein product. Fourteen samples exhibited focal or diffuse immunoreactivity to the p53 protein. Point mutations in the p53 gene were found in five samples: three of these samples exhibited mutations that altered the amino acid sequence. Only two of five samples with p53 mutation exhibited p53 overexpression. Histologic diagnoses on three samples with nonconservative p53 mutation were, respectively, nonproliferative fibrocystic change, papillomatous hyperplasia, and fibroadenoma. CONCLUSION: The clinical significance of p53 mutation, p53 overexpression, and low-level HER-2/neu expression in benign breast tissue remains to be determined. Further research will be necessary to evaluate whether these markers could serve as useful adjuncts to histology in evaluation of the malignant potential of benign breast tissue",

Overexpression of MDM-2 mRNA was observed in three bladder carcinoma cell lines, J82, SCaBER, and BFTC-905. Amplification of the MDM-2 gene was not detected in any of the six cell lines by southern analysis. The deletion in the p53 gene was observed in J82, and point mutation was detected in J82 and BFTC-909, the kidney urothelial carcinoma cell line. In contrast, no mutations were found in codons 12, 13, and 61 in the Ha-ras and Ki-ras genes in these six cell lines. These results indicate that alterations in the p53-regulated pathway are important in bladder carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in matched primary and metastatic human tumors",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been found to be the most frequent genetic alterations in human malignancies. To further examine the idea that neoplastic progression is associated with mutations in the p53 gene, we analyzed matched primary and metastatic tumor samples. The samples included 15 pairs of breast cancer and metastases to lymph nodes, four pairs of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and metastases to liver, one colon adenocarcinoma and metastasis to a lymph node, and one lung carcinoma and metastasis in the pleura. Genomic DNA or cDNA from each tumor sample was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and labeled by using one biotinylated primer. The DNA strands were separated with magnetic streptavidin beads and sequenced directly. p53 mutations were detected in 11 of 21 patients (52%) in either primary tumors, metastases, or both. In six of these patients the primary tumor and matched metastasis shared the same single mutation. In the other patients an additional mutation in the primary tumor only or a mutation in the metastasis only was observed. Our data suggest that tumor development and progression toward metastasis involves structural alterations in the p53 gene that occur early in carcinogenesis. In some cases, genetic changes in metastatic spreading may also include the appearance of a mutation in a metastasis derived from a primary tumor expressing wild-type p53, a selection of metastatic cells with a single mutation from a primary tumor expressing two different mutations, or loss of heterozygosity",

Eleven percent (11 of 96) of the B-CLL cases analyzed in this study and a previous study had mutations in the p53 gene. In contrast, analysis of the p16 gene showed none of 80 B-CLL cases had mutations and five cases (6%) had homozygous deletions. Deletions of 13q14 (DBM) occurred in 18% (17 of 96) of patients surveyed. Thus, 28 of 96 cases showed an alteration in one or more of the three tumor suppressor loci examined. However, cases with p53 mutations rarely showed simultaneous loss of DBM. Our results suggest that inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes p53 and DBM may be mutually exclusive, thus providing alternate pathways for tumor development in B-CLL patients",

    "Abstract": "Mutated ras genes have been found to be conspicuously absent from primary tumors of the esophagus, although high expression of ras p21 oncoprotein in some esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and mutations of the Ki- and Ha-ras genes in esophageal carcinoma cell lines have been reported. In this study, we found amplification of the Ki-ras gene in four of 10 esophageal adenocarcinomas (40%). No such amplification was observed among 61 squamous cell carcinomas, one pseudosarcomatous carcinoma, and eight esophageal cell lines, nor in six adenocarcinomas of the stomach. In two samples on which immunohistochemical analysis could be performed, we found overexpression of Ki-ras proteins when compared with normal samples. This Ki-ras amplification in esophageal tumors did not correlate with any pathological feature of the tumors, with the survival of the patients, or with the presence of other genetic alterations. These findings provide the first evidence for amplification of the Ki-ras gene in human esophageal cancer, which is restricted to adenocarcinomas. We also found that six of eight adenocarcinomas had point mutations in the p53 gene; this is a considerably higher prevalence than that reported for esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. These results strongly suggest that esophageal adenocarcinomas differ from squamous cell carcinomas in their molecular genetic characteristics",

    "Title": "Association between cigarette smoking and mutation of the p53 gene in squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. Although epidemiologic studies have long associated tobacco and alcohol use with the development of squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck, the molecular targets of these carcinogens have yet to be identified. We performed a molecular analysis to determine the pattern of mutations in the p53 gene in neoplasms from patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck and a history of tobacco or alcohol use. METHODS. Sequence analysis of the conserved regions of the p53 gene was performed in tumor samples from 129 patients with primary squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. We then used statistical analysis to identify any patient characteristics associated with mutation of the p53 gene. RESULTS. We found p53 mutations in 42 percent of the patients (54 of 129). Fifty-eight percent of the patients who smoked cigarettes and used alcohol (37 of 64; 95 percent confidence interval, 45 to 70 percent), 33 percent of the patients who smoked but abstained from alcohol (13 of 39; 95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 50 percent), and 17 percent of the patients who neither smoked nor drank alcohol (4 of 24, 95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 37 percent) had p53 mutations (P = 0.001). (Two patients used alcohol but did not smoke, and neither had a p53 mutation.) Furthermore, 100 percent of the mutations in the patients who neither drank nor smoked occurred at sites containing cytidine phosphate guanosine dinucleotides (potentially representing endogenous mutations) within the p53 gene (5 of 5 mutations; 95 percent confidence interval, 48 to 100 percent), whereas only 23 percent of those in cigarette smokers consisted of such changes (12 of 53 mutations; 95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 36 percent; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. In our study, a history of tobacco and alcohol use was associated with a high frequency of p53 mutations in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Preliminary evidence linked cigarette smoking to p53 mutations at nonendogenous mutation sites. Our findings suggest a role for tobacco in the molecular progression of squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck and support the epidemiologic evidence that abstinence from smoking is important to prevent head and neck cancer",

    "Abstract": "To determine whether the dysfunction of p53 protein, caused either by the mutation of p53 gene itself or by the human papillomavirus (HPVs) is involved in the development of cervical cancers and to find out the status of p53 tumor suppressor gene in HPV positive or negative cancers, we analyzed 64 cases of primary cervix cancers. First, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with E6 consensus primer pairs to detect the infection of HPVs in cervix cancer tissues. Second, to screen the p53 gene mutation, PCR of p53 exon 5 through 9 and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis were performed with p53 exon specific primers. Finally, overexpression of p53 protein was checked by immunohistochemical staining with anti p53 antibody. We found HPVs in 43 cases out of 64 cases (67.2%). HPV type 16 was positive in 26 cases, type 18 was positive in 7 cases, and 6 cases were positive for both HPV type 16 and 18. HPV type 31 or 33 was not detected in our experiments, and in 4 cases, type of HPVs were unknown. The SSCP analysis showed mobility shifts in 8 cases (6 in HPV positive cases; 2 in HPV negative cases) and the sequence analysis confirmed the results of SSCP analysis. In addition, the overexpression suggesting the mutation of p53 gene was detected in 27 cases (42.2%, 21 in HPV positive cases; 6 cases in HPV negative cases). Our results support the previous reports that the dysfunction of p53 plays an important role in the development of cervix cancers but contrary to the results obtained from cervix cancer all lines, there is no inverse correlation between HPV infections and p53 mutations in primary cervix cancers",

    "Abstract": "We have studied point mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct nucleotide sequencing. The subtypes examined were: refractory anaemia (RA), refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEBt), and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) which had evolved from MDS. 26 cases of MDS were studied. 12 of these were sequentially sampled but none changed its p53 status during the time of the study (18 months). Four mutations (one nonsense and three missense) were identified. Each case with a mutation was of an advanced MDS subtype, suggesting that p53 mutation in these diseases is a terminal genetic event in the process of leukaemogenesis. The nonsense mutation inserted a premature stop codon in a case of AML which had evolved from RAEB; this mutation has been reported before in both chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and Burkitt's lymphoma. The three missense mutations have not previously been reported in haematological malignancies",

    "Title": "Mutations in the p53 gene are not limited to classic 'hot spots' and are not predictive of p53 protein expression in high-grade non- Hodgkin's lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "We have investigated the relationship between the p53 genotype and phenotype in a series of 22 high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) in which we sequenced the p53 gene open reading frame (exons 2-11). Immunostaining for p53 was already available for these cases. Mutations were found in 10/22 cases (45%) and 3/10 were in exons 4 or 10 outside the classic 'hot spot' regions (exons 5-8). Comparison with immunostaining indicated that, besides cases with the 'expected' patterns (in which gene mutation and protein detection were either both present or both absent) there were also cases in which p53 protein was detected in the absence of any mutation and those with a mutant gene in which the protein was undetectable. These data show that: (1) in high- grade NHLs mutations frequently occur outside the classic hot spot regions and (2) staining for p53 is not predictive of the status of the gene, i.e. whether or not a mutation is present. Therefore in order to document p53 involvement in lymphoid tumours it is necessary both to sequence at least the whole translated open reading frame of the gene and to show evidence of protein expression by immunostaining",

    "Abstract": "We analysed the expression of the p53 gene in various clinical phases of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) by quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Hemizygous expression of the wild-type p53 allele was observed in two samples showing the loss of one p53 allele, and affected p53 expression was associated with p53 allelic loss rather than the clinical phase of CML. In four patients with CML showing p53 inactivation, we performed a detailed sequential analysis of p53 allelic loss, p53 mutation and expression from the onset of the disease to the patients' death. Consequently, we demonstrated that the loss of a wild-type p53 allele preceded mutation of the remaining allele, and that cells hemizygous for the wild-type p53 allele dominated those with both wild-type alleles, then were replaced by cells with complete p53 inactivation. These observations indicate that not only complete p53 inactivation but also hemizygous expression of the wild-type p53 allele may confer a selective growth advantage, and that the former is implicated in a more malignant phase than the latter. Alternatively, the inactivation of another undefined anti-oncogene on chromosome 17p may allow selective growth before the p53 mutation occurs",

    "Abstract": "A novel cell line SKNO-1 was established from the bone marrow cells of a 22-year-old male suffering from acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) M2 with t(8;21) whose disease became resistant to chemotherapy after acquisition of 17 monosomy. SKNO-1 has been maintained for more than 36 months as a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) dependent line. Morphologically, SKNO-1 cells were myeloblasts somewhat matured. The cells grow in suspension with a doubling time of 48-72 h. The survival and growth of SKNO-1 cells was absolutely dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). SKNO-1 cells possessed t(8;21) and monosomy 17 which were observed in original leukaemic cells. We confirmed that the AML1 gene, located on chromosome 21, was rearranged and the AML1-MTG8 fusion transcript was expressed in SKNO-1 cells. Over-expression and mutation of the p53 gene were also detected in SKNO-1. It is likely that alterations of AML1 or MTG8 gene and p53 gene contribute to a disease progression in this case. Since t(8;21) translocation is a common chromosome abnormality in AML, and inactivation of the p53 gene may play a crucial role in disease progression in AML, SKNO-1 would be a useful tool for analysing the molecular mechanisms in myeloid leukaemogenesis",

There are mainly point mutations that lead to single amino acid substitutions. The mutated proteins have a longer half-life than wild-type p53 and accumulate in the nucleus of tumor cells. Anti-p53 antibodies have been found in sera of patients with several types of cancers including breast cancer. This report describes a T cell immune response in three patients with breast tumors who had mutated p53 gene and accumulated p53 protein. All showed a humoral response to p53 protein and the T cells of these patients recognized the wild-type p53 protein and proliferated in response to it.

    "Title": "Aberrations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in human epithelial ovarian carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Aberrations of the p53 gene in 26 surgical specimens of human epithelial ovarian carcinomas were examined by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. Seven (27%) of the tumors demonstrated a SSCP band shift in exons 4 to 9 of the gene, including 5 in the region encompassing exons 5 and 6, 1 in exon 7, and 1 in the region encompassing exons 8 and 9. Mutations were clustered in exon 5 in highly conserved regions of the p53 gene. All of the abnormal DNA fragments have been further characterized by direct DNA sequencing. These include five missense mutations (five transitions), a one-base- pair deletion introducing, by frameshift, a stop codon further downstream, and a two-base-pair insertion introducing a stop codon downstream by frameshift. Most mutations were base substitutions, and were clustered in exon 5 (71%), especially codons 175 and 179. The aberrations of the p53 gene were only found in tumors of FIGO stages III and IV. Histologic grading was also reviewed with respect to p53 aberrations. The aberrations were absent in well-differentiated carcinomas. The more undifferentiated the primary tumor, the more frequent p53 mutation (P < 0.05). Our results indicated that the aberrations of the p53 gene were common in epithelial ovarian cancers and p53 aberration may occur late during ovarian cancer evolution",

    "Title": "Uterine cervix adenocarcinoma with both human papillomavirus type 18 and tumor suppressor gene p53 mutation from a woman having an intact hymen",
    "Abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 18 DNA was found in an aggressively invasive adenocarcinoma tumor from a woman who had an intact hymen and denied any prior sexual intercourse. The viral DNA was detected within the tumor tissue by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using consensus primers for the L1 region of oncogenic high-risk genital HPVs. In order to determine mutations within the tumor suppressor gene p53, the gene exons were amplified by PCR followed by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. The appearance of a mutation in exon 8 of the p53 gene suggested by SSCP was directly confirmed by DNA sequencing of the exon. The sequencing showed a single base deletion that may truncate the protein by introducing a early stop codon in the messenger RNA. This early truncation could be expected to affect the proper oligomerization of the p53 protein and hence its DNA-binding activity. The results show that genital oncogenic human papillomaviruses may be passed by nonsexual routes and suggest that the virus may work in concert with p53 mutations to help the infected tissue progress toward invasive cancer",

    "Abstract": "The frequencies of p53 and N-ras gene mutations were examined in multiple myeloma. DNA samples of 45 cases of multiple myeloma were obtained from stored bone marrow smears. All samples were analyzed for the N-ras gene at codon 12 by the allele specific restriction analysis method and at codon 61 by direct sequencing. DNA was screened for mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis for the p53 gene in exons 5 to 8. DNA fragments showing an altered electrophoretic pattern were further studied by direct sequencing to confirm the mutations. Ras mutations were found in two cases at codon 61 (4.4%). A point mutation of the p53 gene was detected in one of 45 cases (2.2%). These 3 cases with mutations were in an advanced stage. In conclusion, N-ras and p53 gene mutations may occur at a late stage of multiple myeloma, but the frequencies of the mutations are very low",

    "Title": "Novel pattern of P53 mutation in breast cancers from Austrian women (published erratum appears in J Clin Invest 1995 Jun;95(6):2991)",
    "Abstract": "Since mutagens produce an extraordinary diversity of mutational patterns, differential mutational exposures among populations are expected to produce different patterns of mutation. Classical epidemiological methods have been successful in implicating specific mutagens in cancers such as those of lung and skin in which one mutagen predominates. In breast cancer, however, no mutagens have been implicated in an unequivocal manner. In an attempt to facilitate epidemiological studies, we have been studying the pattern of p53 gene mutations in breast cancers from multiple populations with high and low breast cancer incidences. We previously reported that breast cancers from Midwest United States, predominantly rural Caucasian women, have a different pattern of p53 gene mutation from populations of Western European women. Herein, we analyze patterns of p53 mutations from Graz, Austria, another population with a high incidence of breast cancer. Among the 60 Austrian breast cancers analyzed, 14 (23%) have a p53 gene mutation in exons 5-9 or in adjacent splice junctions. Analysis of the patterns of mutation shows differences between the 'Western European' profile and the Austrian and Midwest United States groups (P = 0.027 and 0.024, respectively). The Austrian pattern is characterized by a high frequency of A:T-->T:A transversions (P = 0.006). The presence of distinct patterns of mutation among the limited number of analyzed populations of Western European origin supports the idea that differential mutagenic exposure and/or genetic differences contribute to breast cancer mutagenesis among geographically distinct Caucasians of Western European origin",

Single or multiple changes were observed in 11 of the lines. Alterations of the p53 gene were most frequent and documented for 10 lines by immunoprecipitation using the antibodies PAb 240 and PAb 1801, sequencing studies and Southern blot analysis. A detailed study was performed in one of the cell lines (OCI-Ly 4) for which material of the original tumor sample was available. Two point mutations identified by sequencing cDNA derived from the cell line were also present in the original tumor specimen. In contrast, DNA prepared from fibroblasts of the same patient did not show the mutations. Six of the 14 lines demonstrated c-myc rearrangements, while bcl-2 changes were observed in 4. The presence of c-myc was associated with shorter survival of this group of patients with aggressive disease. None of the other changes present as single or composite alterations were correlated with clinical outcome measures",

    "Abstract": "The p53 tumour-suppressor gene plays an important role in gastric carcinogenesis. In an analysis of the spectrum of mutations of the p53 gene seen in 56 primary gastric carcinomas of various types and grades of differentiation, the entire coding sequence (exons 2-11) of the p53 gene was screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct genomic sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products. Intragenic restriction site polymorphisms and the probe YNZ22 were used for the detection of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the p53 gene locus on chromosome 17p. p53 overexpression was studied with the anti-p53 antibody CM-1. A total of 21 somatic alterations of the p53 gene were found. Twenty were base-pair substitutions, and one was an eight base- pair deletion. Six tumours with p53 mutations revealed LOH. Abnormalities in p53 expression were found in 17 tumour samples, of which 16 had gene mutations. The spectrum of mutations observed was consistent with the predicted spectrum for dietary mutagens associated with the metabolism of nitrogenous compounds, resulting in deamination of nucleic acids. Our findings suggest that p53 could be a primary target for mutations associated with dietary carcinogens in gastric carcinogenesis",

    "Abstract": "With the aim of detecting the timing of p53 and Ki-ras gene alterations in the gastric adenoma-carcinoma sequence, 19 early gastric adenocarcinomas arising from adenomas were studied. Immunohistochemically, 5 adenocarcinomas were positive for p53; 3 focally and 2 diffusely. The p53 point mutations were detected in a focal area with p53 immunoreactivity in 2 of the 5 p53-positive adenocarcinomas. This indicated that p53 point mutations may play a less crucial part in malignant conversion of adenoma to adenocarcinoma in the stomach than in the colon. No Ki-ras gene mutations at codons 12 and 13 were detected in any lesion. These results suggest that the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in the stomach has a different mechanism from that in the colon",

This study was designed to determine whether there is immunoreactivity for p53 and mdm2 protein in malignant mesothelioma and to correlate p53 expression with the detection of mutations in p53 at DNA level. In 10 of 15 cases there was immunoreactivity for p53. In 6 of these cases immunoreactivity for mdm2 was also detected. In one p53-immunonegative case, a mutation of the p53 gene resulting in a stop codon was found. These results suggest that mdm2 might be involved in the inhibition of p53 in malignant mesothelioma. Also, these data suggest the existence of other proteins than mdm2 that may associate with p53",

    "Abstract": "Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis in women. We initiated an investigation of the role of gender in pulmonary carcinogenesis by analysis of p53 mutations, immunohistochemistry, serum antibodies and c-erbB-2 expression in a series of 63 male and 44 female lung cancer patients whose tumors were resected at the Mayo Clinic between 1991 and 1992. There were 102 smokers and 5 never smoked. Adenocarcinoma was the more frequent histological type in women (62%) than in men (41%). Sequence analysis of exons 5-8 in 42 females and 49 males identified 44 p53 mutations in 42 tumors (46%). Base substitution mutations showed a preponderance of G:C-->T:A transversions, which were more frequent in women than men (40 versus 25%) and in individuals exposed to asbestos. c-erbB-2 immunohistochemical staining was identified more frequently in females (nine cases) than males (two cases). Marked immunohistochemical staining for p53 positively correlated with the presence of missense mutations in exons 5-8 (81%, P < 0.001). Seven missense mutations (four in exon 5, two in exon 6, one in exon 8) were identified in five of nine patients who had serum antibodies recognizing p53; tumors from these patients were also strongly positive for p53 by immunohistochemistry. These and other results indicate gender differences in the genetic and biochemical alterations in lung cancer and generate hypothesis regarding gender differences in lung cancer susceptibility",

    "Title": "Mutations in the p53 gene in schistosomal bladder cancer: a study of 92 tumours from Egyptian patients and a comparison between mutational spectra from schistosomal and non-schistosomal urothelial tumours",
    "Abstract": "Much of bladder cancer in East Africa and the Middle East is attributed to chronic urinary infection with Schistosoma haematobium ('schistosomiasis'). Most schistosomal bladder cancer (SBC) is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and occurs in the fifth decade of life. In contrast, nonschistosomal bladder cancer (NSBC) in Western countries usually occurs in the seventh decade of life and is largely transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). To shed light on the mechanisms underlying these different patterns of bladder cancer we looked for mutations in the p53 gene in SBC from 92 patients in Egypt, where schistosomiasis is hyperendemic. Patients' mean age at presentation of bladder cancer was 49.4 +/- 9.9 years and 90% had a clinical history of schistosomiasis and/or histological evidence of schistosomal eggs adjacent to the carcinoma. There were 53 SCC, 23 TCC, 13 adenocarcinomas and three other carcinomas. Thirty patients had tumours with mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene: 17/53 SCC, 8/23 TCC, 4/13 adenocarcinomas and 1/3 other tumours. Of 19 mutations in SCC, 16 were base pair substitutions (BPS), two were deletions and one an insertion. Two tumours each contained two mutations. Of the BPS, nine were transitions at CpG dinucleotides and two were G-->T transversions. All the mutations in TCC were BPS: four were transitions at CpG dinucleotides and three were G-->C transversions. One TCC had two mutations. Of four adenocarcinomas with mutations, two had transitions at CpG dinucleotides. Of the 30 BPS mutations, 16 were transitions at CpG dinucleotides, of which 12 were C-->T. We combined these 33 mutations with six obtained from Egyptian SCC reported by Habuchi et al. (Cancer Res., 53, 3795-3799, 1993) to compile a mutational spectrum. This was compared with a NSBC spectrum assembled from 118 mutations reported in the literature. The proportion of BPS at CpG dinucleotides was significantly higher in SBC than in NSBC (18/34 versus 25/103, P = 0.003). There was also a bias away from mutations in exons 7 and 8 towards mutations in exons 5 and 6. We suggest that the excess of transitions at CpG dinucleotides in SBC results from nitric oxide (NO) produced by the inflammatory response provoked by schistosomal eggs. NO could produce such mutations directly, by deamination of 5-methylcytosine, and indirectly, following conversion to nitrate, bacterial reduction to nitrite and endogenous formation of urinary N-nitroso compounds. These produce O6-alkylguanines in DNA, leading to very high rates of G:C-->A:T transitions, a process possibly augmented by inefficient repair of alkylated bases at CpG dinucleotides",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in primary hepatic angiosarcomas not associated with vinyl chloride exposure",
    "Abstract": "Angiosarcomas of the liver are rare, malignant cancers composed of neoplastic blood vessels. Human hapatic angiosarcomas have been associated with liver cirrhosis or exposure to vinyl chloride, Thorotrast or arsenic. A recent analysis of six hepatic angiosarcomas associated with vinal chloride exposure found three mutations and all were A:T --> T:A transversions, which are otherwise uncommon in human cancers. To test the specificity of this mutation spectrum, we analyzed 21 hepatic angiosarcomas not associated with vinyl chloride exposure. Four cases were exposed to Thorotrast, none had a history of arsenic exposure and the rest were sporadic. Exons 5-8 of the p53 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the products were sequenced directly. Two G:C --> A:T transitions were found in two tumors: TGCstop in codon 136. Neither mutation was associated with Thorotrast exposure. These data indicate that p53 mutations are uncommon in sporadic hepatic angiosarcomas (2/21, 9%), and the mutational profile is consistent with endogenous mechanisms. Both features support the evidence linking vinyl chloride exposure to hepatic angiosarcomas containing an increased frequency of p53 mutations with a mutational spectrum (i.e. A:T --> T:A transversions) characteristic of chloroethylene oxide, a carcinogenic metabolite of vinyl chloride",

    "Title": "Variation of p53 mutational spectra between carcinoma of the upper and lower respiratory tract",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most common genetic alterations associated with human cancer. Tumor-associated p53 mutations often show characteristic tissue-specific profiles which may infer environmentally induced mutational mechanisms. The p53 mutational frequency and spectrum were determined for 95 carcinomas of the upper and lower respiratory tract (32 lung and 63 upper respiratory tract). Mutations were identified at a frequency of 30% in upper respiratory tract (URT) tumors and 31% in lung tumors. All 29 identified mutations were single-base substitutions. Comparison of the frequency of specific base substitutions between lung and URT showed a striking difference. Transitions occurred at a frequency of 68% in URT, but only 30% in lung. Mutations involving G:C-->A:T transitions, which are commonly reported in gastric and esophageal tumors, were the most frequently identified alteration in URT (11/19). Mutations involving G:C-->T:A transversions, which were relatively common in lung tumors (3/10) and are representative of tobacco smoke-induced mutations were rare in URT tumors (1/19). Interestingly, G:C-->A:T mutations at CpG sites, which are characteristic of endogenous processes, were observed frequently in URT tumors (9/19) but only rarely in lung tumors (1/10), suggesting that both endogenous and exogenous factors are responsible for the observed differences in mutational spectra between the upper and lower respiratory systems",

    "Title": "Absence of p53 autoantibodies in sera from glioma patients",
    "Abstract": "Alteration of the tumor suppressor gene p53 is the most frequent genetic feature of human cancer and leads to over-expression and loss of function of the p53 protein in affected cells. Patients with many types of cancer, including breast, lung, and colon carcinoma, were shown to develop auto-immune response against the overexpressed protein and to produce autoantibodies directed to immunodominant epitopes common for both wild type and mutants. The presence of p53 autoantibodies (p53-aAb) seems to be, at least in patients with breast and bronchial tumors, related to an unfavorable prognosis. The present study aimed to investigate the presence of p53-aAb in patients with malignant glioma. Sera from 70 consecutive patients with gliomas graded WHO G III and IV were collected and assayed together with sera from 30 controls. A new photometric sandwich-ELISA was used for semiquantitative analysis of p53-aAb titers. p53 gene and its protein product were examined in formalin-fixed and fresh-frozen tumor tissues using immunohistochemistry, PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism, and sequencing. Sixty percent of the glioma cases showed immunohistochemically positive cells, thus indicating intracellular accumulation of p53. Sequencing of the hot-spot exons 5-8 revealed mutations in 39% of the tumor cases. In contrast to results in other types of malignant tumors, where up to 40% of patients have high serum titers of p53-aAb, no such antibodies were found in patients with malignant cerebral glioma despite the presence of mutated or alterated p53 protein in the primary tumors. None of the non-cancer control patients had detectable titers of p53-aAb, although sera from five of six lung cancer patients had medium to high titers. The presented data suggest that glial tumors are unusual in the absence of serum antibodies to p53. It is hypothesized that impaired function of most immunocompetent cells invading brain tumors could be the cause for the absence of an autoimmune response",

We identified p53 mutations in 29 tumors (40.3%) by PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. Amplification of the MDM2 gene was detected by Southern blot hybridization in 13 (18.1%) of 72 tumor tissues and in 4 (33.3%) of 12 cultured esophageal squamous cell lines. All four cell lines with MDM2 amplifications showed overexpression of the MDM2 mRNA in Northern blotting. We observed HPV infection in 15 (20.8%) of 72 tumor tissues by specific PCR amplification and Southern blot hybridization. In most tumors, amplification of the MDM2 gene or infection of HPV was not associated with p53 mutations, except in four cases with p53 mutation and MDM2 amplification, and three cases with p53 mutation and HPV infection. Since p53 mutations, MDM2 overexpression, and HPV infection are all considered to abrogate the normal function of p53 protein, each of these genetic changes may be equally important in tumorigenesis. In addition, we found that patients with MDM2 amplification exhibited a significantly shorter survival period (P = 0.0053)",

    "Abstract": "In prostate cancer, mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene has been associated with locally advanced disease and hormone-resistant disease that is predominantly localized to bone. However, little is known regarding the status of the p53 gene in metastatic prostate cancer that has not been treated with hormonal manipulation. We evaluated formalin- fixed, paraffin-embedded malignant tissues from 86 patients with various stages of prostate cancer, including pathologically confined, locally advanced, and metastatic disease, to detect abnormal p53 nuclear protein accumulation using immunohistochemistry. No abnormal p53 immunostaining was detected in 18 patients with prostate cancer confined to the gland. Two tumors from 21 patients with locally advanced disease (extracapsular extension and/or seminal vesicle invasion) had abnormal nuclear p53 accumulation, and a mutation in exon 7 of the p53 gene was detected in tumor DNA from one patient using single-strand conformation polymorphism-direct sequencing analysis. Of the remaining 47 patients studied in whom tissues from the prostate gland and a metastatic site (44 lymph node, 2 bone, and 1 lung) were available, only 3 had received hormonal therapy prior to obtaining metastatic tissue. In four patients both primary and metastatic tumors demonstrated accumulation of p53 protein, whereas seven additional patients exhibited p53 accumulation only at the metastatic site. In three patients the metastatic tumors harbored missense single-base substitutions in exon 5, as detected using single-strand conformation polymorphism-direct sequencing. These results indicate that p53 abnormalities are associated with lymph node metastases derived from prostate cancer patients that had not undergone hormonal therapy",

    "Abstract": "We analyzed allelic loss at the p53 gene (17p13) and at chromosome region 9p21 in 35 primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at p53 and 9p21 was found in 50 and 75% of informative cases, respectively. LOH at the p53 gene did not increase significantly with tumor stage, but was more frequent in moderately and poorly differentiated tumors than in well-differentiated tumors. LOH plus mutation or homozygous deletion of p53 was limited to advanced stage and poorly differentiated tumors. Allelic loss at 9p21 is frequent in early stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is not significantly associated with LOH at p53. The second exon of the p16/MTS1/CDKN2 gene was found to be homozygously deleted in 1 of 19 cases showing LOH at 9p21, but direct sequencing did not show mutations in the remaining 18 cases. This suggests that p16 plays a limited role in the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Recently, several groups have isolated a cell cycle inhibitor gene (CIP1/WAF1) that is highly induced by wild-type, but not mutant forms of the p53 tumor suppressor. To test the hypothesis that p53 regulates CIP1/WAF1 expression in vivo, we evaluated CIP1/WAF1 mRNA expression levels in breast carcinomas from individuals with axillary node-negative disease with and without p53 mutations using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The data demonstrate that there is a strong negative correlation between the presence of p53 mutations and CIP1/WAF1 expression, suggesting that p53 mutations may reduce its ability to induce CIP1/WAF1 in vivo. In this study we observed tumors with low levels of CIP1/WAF1 mRNA in which there were no detectable p53 mutations. Determination of the CIP1/WAF1 levels in such specimens may provide a complementary strategy for analyzing the effects of p53 defects and/or may suggest the presence of alterations (such as coding mutations outside the conserved regions, promoter mutations, etc.) that may be missed by standard techniques",

    "Title": "Radiation induced G1-block and p53 status in six human cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Considerable attention has recently been focused on the fact that the tumor suppressor protein p53 is involved in the cellular response to radiation. In its wild-type form the protein appears to control a cell cycle checkpoint, preventing entry into S-phase following DNA damage. A number of authors observed a radiation induced G1-block in cells expressing wild-type p53, but not in p53 mutant cells. We obtained similar results with four human tumour cell lines as well as two strains of human fibroblasts, whose p53 status was ascertained at the protein as well as DNA levels. In addition to cell cycle delays in exponentially growing cell cultures, we have studied the possible role of the p53 in the transition from quiescence to active proliferation. Cells were irradiated after 6 days of serum-starvation and labelled with BrdU at different times after addition of fresh medium. Entry into S-phase was found to be delayed by several hours in the p53 wild-type cells, but no such effect was observed in the p53 mutants. Where a delay occurred, it was roughly proportional to the X-ray dose. Although it remains to be clarified, whether the cells were delayed only in G1 or also in G0, it is interesting to note that entry into S-phase can be delayed by irradiation in a quiescent state immediately before serum- stimulation, provided the cells are wild-type with respect to p53. Certain differences in the cell cycle response of transformed and untransformed cells were noted",

    "Title": "Alteration of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and activation of c-K-ras-2 protooncogene in endometrial adenocarcinoma from Colorado",
    "Abstract": "The authors previously reported a significant frequency of activating point mutations in codon 12 and 13 of the K-ras gene in endometrial carcinoma and endometrial atypical hyperplasia from Osaka, Japan. They also showed that alterations of the p53 gene are found frequently in those tumors. This study was designed to reveal possible demographic differences in the prevalence of K-ras and p53 mutations in endometrial carcinoma. Tumor-enriched areas of paraffin-embedded histologic sections obtained through the Colorado Central Cancer Registry were isolated and extracted for DNA. Fragments amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were screened for transforming mutations in codon 12, 13, or 59-63 of K-ras by direct sequencing. Of 38 endometrial adenocarcinomas that were analyzed, K-ras activation was detected in 4 cases (11%), three in codon 12 (a single case with a GGT-->AGT transition, a single case with a GGT-->GAT transition, and a single case with a GGT-->TGT transversion) and one in codon 13 (a GGC-->GAC mutation). The prevalence of K-ras mutations was significantly lower in endometrial carcinomas from Colorado (4 of 38, 11%) than in those from Osaka, Japan (17 of 57, 31%; P = .02). Mutations in exons 5-8 of p53 were screened by PCR-SSCP analysis, and subsequently confirmed by direct sequencing. Mutations in the p53 gene were detected in 5 of 38 endometrial carcinomas from Colorado (13%), including a single base substitution mutation in 3 cases (60%) and a deletion mutation in 2 cases (40%). Mutations in the p53 gene were significantly more frequently found in G3 cancers (3 of 7, 43%) than G1-G2 cancers combined (2 of 31, 6%; P = .025). Although the prevalence of p53 mutations in endometrial carcinomas from Colorado was not significantly different compared to that from Osaka, Japan (9 of 40, 23%), a G:C-- >A:T transition at a CpG site, which was the most common base substitution mutation among Japanese, was not included in any tumors from Colorado. A rare polymorphism in codon 213 (CGA-->CGG) was observed in three cases. These observations may indicate that genetic or environmental factors may significantly influence the pathway of endometrial carcinogenesis",

    "Abstract": "p53 protein expression in 34 thymic epithelial tumors was examined immunohistochemically, and p53 gene mutation was detected in selected cases by DNA sequencing, using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. The tumors comprised 12 noninvasive thymomas, 9 invasive/metastatic thymomas, and 13 thymic carcinomas. All the tumors were immunoreactive for p53 protein. The p53-positive tumor cells in noninvasive thymoma were less than 10% (low expressor) in 7 cases and 10% to 50% (moderate expressor) in 5 cases. In invasive/metastatic thymoma, two were low expressors and seven were moderate expressors. In thymic carcinomas, there were nine moderate expressors and four high expressors (with > 50% positive cells). There was significant difference in p53 protein immunopositivity between thymic carcinoma and each of the noninvasive or invasive/metastatic thymomas. The DNA sequencing study confirmed the presence of p53 gene point mutation in all 10 cases examined, including three low expressors. These results suggest that p53 gene mutation is an early event in thymic tumorigenesis, and the p53 protein-positive cells increase with the progression of the tumor. Immunostaining reactivity of p53 may be a useful adjunct to differentiate thymic carcinoma from thymoma",

    "Abstract": "Using monoclonal antibody PAb 1801, p53 protein was detected in the neoplastic cells of 39 (46.9%) of 83 colorectal carcinomas studied. Patients with p53+ tumors showed a higher incidence of lymph node and liver metastases (p = 0.035); in patients whose tumors were located in the rectosigmoid, p53 expression also correlated with a more advanced stage according to Dukes' classification (p = 0.015) as well as nodal (p = 0.006) and liver (p = 0.019) metastases. Following amplification of exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene by means of the polymerase chain reaction technique, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis disclosed an anomalous migration pattern in 23 of the 39 p53+ tumors and in four of the 35 p53- tumors analyzed. Sequence analysis showed G:C-->A:T transitions in 63.6%, G:C-->T:A and G:C-->C:G transversions in 18.2%, deletions and insertions in 13.6%, and A:T-->G:C transitions in 4.6% of the cases. Loss of heterozygosity was studied in the DNA of 79 patients; allelic loss was found in 29 (49.1%) of the 59 informative patients. Loss of heterozygosity was correlated with p53 overexpression (p = 0.0002) as well as with the presence of mutations as detected by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (p = 0.0024)",

The study was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-assisted single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 5-8 and direct sequence analysis of PCR products. For immunohistochemistry, DO1 and PAb 1801 were used. No mutation and no positivity for p53 protein were found in pilocytic astrocytomas. Mutations (at codons 144, 202, and 245) were found in 2 out of 8 glioblastomas and in 1 out of 9 anaplastic astrocytomas, whereas positive staining was found in 11 out of 17 malignant gliomas. Cases with mutations showed the highest p53 labeling index and also PCNA and MIB-1 labeling indices. The negative results in pilocytic astrocytomas are in line with the benign course of these tumors, whereas for malignant gliomas no difference seems to exist in comparison with adult cases",

    "Abstract": "A case of a 54-year-old woman is described who developed synchronously two malignant bone tumors: a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma in the olecranon and a malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) in the lower tibia. The anaplastic part of the dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma revealed an MFH-like pattern. Myogenous differentiations were not observed in the anaplastic sarcoma cells. The MFH in the tibia showed a storiform-pleomorphic pattern. Single tumor cells showed positivity for M-actin and desmin pointing to myogenous differentiation. DNA- cytophotometry of the dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma showed an aneuploid stem cell line. The MFH in the tibia did not reveal aneuploid stem cells. Staining for p53 protein was negative in both tumors. SSCP analysis and sequencing of the p53 gene in both tumors revealed in the dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma a mutation in exon-8 with the transversion from G to T in codon 294 resulting in a substitution of a stop codon for GLU. The mutation was not observed in the MFH. From these immunohistologic, DNA-cytometric and molecular biologic investigations, we consider it probable that the tumor in the lower tibia is a second highly malignant bone tumor and not the metastasis of the dedifferentiated portion of the dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma in the olecranon",

Fifteen cases of subclinical and 32 cases of clinical carcinoma, the latter graded in stages A through D, were available for study. While p53 point mutations were detected in only 5 of 32 (16%) clinical cancers, no mutations were detected in latent disease. Of the carcinomas in stages B, C and D, 15% (2/13), 29% (2/7) and 9% (1/11) were positive for p53 mutations, respectively. Although no specific mutational patterns were observed, the aberrations found were predominantly single base missense substitutions. The data suggest not only an association of p53 mutation and progression of clinical prostate cancer, but also imply that some other mechanism(s) are at work in latent carcinoma",

    "Title": "Association of p53 gene mutations with short survival in pancreatic adenocarcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 gene have been found in a variety of human cancers and are implicated in the biologic functions of cancer. To investigate the clinical implications of p53 mutations in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, we examined the association of mutations of the p53 gene with patients' prognosis. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing were used to detect p53 gene mutations in 37 pancreatic adenocarcinomas. p53 gene mutations were detected in 16 (43%) of the 37 pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Direct sequencing did not reveal preferential clustering at any specific codon. There was no significant association of the presence of p53 gene mutations with histologic types, extent of tumor invasion, the presence of lymph node metastasis, or tumor stage. Univariate analysis showed that survival of patients with p53-gene-mutated tumors was significantly poorer than that of patients with p53-gene-nonmutated tumors (P = 0.02). Cox's multivariate analysis of ten clinicopathologic features including p53 gene mutations revealed that presence of p53 gene mutations (P = 0.026) and curativity of operation (P = 0.014) were independent predictors of survival. Furthermore, the survival of patients with p53-gene-mutated tumor was significantly poorer than that of patients with p53-gene-nonmutated tumors, both in patients who underwent curative operation (P = 0.04) and in patients who underwent non-curative operation (P = 0.01). These results suggested that mutations of the p53 gene might play an important role in cancer aggressiveness and could be a clinically useful predictor of prognosis in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Genomic DNA was extracted from aspiration biopsy specimens taken from 15 suspected cases of breast cancer, including 7 known cases of breast cancer, and the p53 gene was studied for evidence of mutation by using a polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. In 5 of the 15 cases (33%), p53 gene mutation was identified and these tumors were subsequently histologically diagnosed as malignant. Further, DNA flow cytometry of the 15 tumors demonstrated that 6 (40%) were aneuploid and malignant, whereas 9 (60%) were diploid and benign. It was also found that the tumor cells in 5 aspirated cases that showed p53 gene mutations were all aneuploid, the p53 protein expression was positive, and the tumors were proved to be histologically malignant. It was thus concluded that the detection of p53 gene mutation by PCR-SSCP analysis of aspirated biopsy specimens from suspected breast cancers is a helpful method for achieving a more accurate diagnosis",

    "Abstract": "Using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis, p53 gene mutation was examined in 12 intracranial germ cell tumors (5 yolk sac carcinomas and 7 germinomas), many of which were derived from young patients in the first to the second decade. A total of 10 mutations were detected in 4 of the 12 cases and, in 3 of them, the mutations were multiple or tandem. Among the 10 mutations, 7 were missense, 1 was splicing and 2 were silent. The 7 missense mutations were located at previously proposed hot spot codons or in their vicinity or, when outside the hot spots, at a codon encoding an amino acid conserved in most vertebrates. These findings suggested that all 7 missense mutations may actually give rise to functional alteration of the p53 protein. The splicing mutation was considered to be a germ-line mutation, though its biological effect was equivocal, since the neoplastic tissue contained an additional mutation. The pattern of the mutations was predominancy of G:C-A:T transition with frequent involvement of the CpG site. These mutations were more frequently detected in yolk sac carcinomas (60%; 3/5 cases) than in germinomas (14%; 1/7 cases), suggesting that the contribution of the p53 mutation to carcinogenesis differed with the histological type of the intracranial germ cell tumor",

By immunohistochemistry, p53 expression was observed in the tumor cells. Automated direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified DNA revealed a homozygous transition in p53 codon 280 (AGA to GGA) as the molecular basis of p53 accumulation. Previous studies suggest that gastric carcinomas with mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene are associated with particularly poor prognosis when compared with tumors without p53 mutations.

Fourteen mutations were detected. Most occurred at the dipyrimidine sequences of DNA, suggesting that they were caused by ultraviolet light. A strong correlation was noted between the presence of the p53 mutations and clinical characteristics such as histology and growth of SCC. In well-differentiated grade 1 SCCs, three (27.3%) of 11 tumors had the p53 gene mutations, whereas in grade 2 and grade 3 SCCs, six (85.7%) of seven tumors had the p53 gene mutations (p < 0.05). Tumors less than 8.0 mm in diameter showed a relatively low frequency of mutation (two of 10 tumors, 20.0%), whereas most of the tumors larger than 8.1 mm (seven of eight tumors, 87.5%) had mutations of the p53 gene (p < 0.025). Multiple tumors in the same xeroderma pigmentosum patients also showed this relation. These results suggest that mutations in the p53 gene lead to the invasive and rapid-growing character of SCC",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the frequency of p53 mutations in 47 pediatric brain tumors of various histologic subtypes that were collected over a period of 5 years. The specimens included 15 primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), 17 low grade astrocytomas, one anaplastic astrocytoma, three glioblastomas (GBMs), one mixed glial tumor, eight ependymomas, one choroid plexus carcinoma, and one gangliocytoma/ganglioneuroma. Mutations were identified by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 4-8 and verified by sequencing. Mutations were present in 2 of 3 cases of GBM, but not in 17 low grade astrocytomas (P = 0.02, Fisher's exact test). One GBM demonstrated a germline GGC to AGC transition (gly to ser) at codon 245 with loss of the wild-type allele. A second GBM contained a CGG to TGG transition (arg to trp) at codon 248, also with loss of the wild-type allele, but normal tissue was not available for comparison. In addition, one of 15 PNETs retained heterozygosity but demonstrated a somatic CGT to TGT transition (arg to cys) at codon 273. p53 mutations were absent in other histologic subtypes and in two cases with multiple primary cancers. These data are consistent with earlier findings that p53 mutations are rare in PNETs, which are primarily pediatric tumors. In contrast to adult gliomas, p53 mutations in pediatric gliomas appear restricted to the GBMs. The lack of p53 mutations in pediatric low grade astrocytomas suggests not only histological differences, but also a different molecular pathogenesis in adult and pediatric patients",

    "Title": "Genetic disparity between morphologically benign cysts contiguous to ovarian carcinomas and solitary cystadenomas",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian carcinomas occasionally contain large, histologically benign cysts contiguous to the clearly malignant areas (cystadenocarcinomas). The question of whether such cysts are remnants of pre-existing benign tumors (cystadenomas) or constitute integral components of the carcinomas is important in clarifying the role of cystadenomas in ovarian carcinogenesis. It is also important for our general understanding of tumor heterogeneity, a phenomenon thought to result from the gradual accumulation of genetic abnormalities in initially homogeneous tumors. This question is also pertinent to the clinical management of ovarian cystadenomas, which are frequent in women of childbearing age and are usually treated surgically based on the possibility that they may give rise to carcinomas. PURPOSE: Reasoning that molecular markers of ovarian malignancy would be confined to the histologically malignant portions of cystadenocarcinomas if the morphologically benign portions are in fact pre-existing typical cystadenomas, we sought to verify that mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are markers of malignancy in ovarian tumors and to determine the distribution of such mutations in cystadenocarcinomas. METHODS: We used immunohistochemical and DNA- sequencing techniques to analyze 46 ovarian carcinomas, 21 ovarian tumors of low malignant potential, and 16 solitary cystadenomas for the presence of p53 mutations. We then used similar techniques to examine the distribution of such mutations in different portions of cystadenocarcinomas. The observed differences in mutation frequencies were analyzed by the two-tailed Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Mutations in the p53 gene were present in 24 (52%) of the 46 carcinomas, but they were absent in the 21 tumors of low malignant potential (P < .0001) and the 16 solitary cystadenomas (P = .0002). Six of six cystadenocarcinomas with p53 mutations showed the presence of the same mutations in the adjacent, histologically benign cysts. The mutations were seen not only in cells immediately adjacent to the carcinomas, but also throughout the morphologically benign cysts. Twenty (83%) of the 24 cases showing mutation of one p53 allele also showed loss of genetic heterozygosity, suggesting that the other p53 allele was deleted. Such allelic loss, if present in morphologically malignant portions of cystadenocarcinomas, was also observed in the contiguous cysts. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian carcinomas can be distinguished from ovarian cystadenomas and tumors of low malignant potential by p53 mutations. The fact that the mutations were present in histologically benign cysts contiguous to ovarian carcinomas suggests that such cysts are not typical cystadenomas and may carry a genetic predisposition to carcinogenesis that is not present in ordinary cystadenomas",

    "Title": "Anti-p53 antibodies in sera of workers occupationally exposed to vinyl chloride",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The p53 tumor suppressor gene (also known as TP53) is often mutated in a wide variety of cancers, including angiosarcoma of the liver (ASL). Anti-p53 antibodies have been detected in the sera of patients with leukemia, childhood lymphoma, or cancers such as those of the breast, lung, colon, esophagus, and liver (hepatocellular carcinoma). PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and time of appearance of serum anti-p53 antibodies during the pathogenesis of ASL associated with occupational exposure to vinyl chloride. METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) was used to detect anti-p53 antibodies in 148 serum samples from 92 individuals occupationally exposed (in France or in Kentucky) to vinyl chloride; 15 of these individuals (six from France and nine from Kentucky) had ASL. A subset of coded EIA-positive and EIA-negative sera was further analyzed for anti-p53 antibodies by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Nucleotide sequence analysis of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene was conducted on ASL DNA from six patients. We tested sera from 31 men who had no occupational exposure to vinyl chloride; they made up the control group. Statistical analyses were done using the Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared approximation and the Wilcoxon two-sample test for normal approximation. All P values result from two-sided tests. RESULTS: Fourteen serum samples (from nine individuals) were positive in the EIA. Five of the 15 individuals with ASL were positive for anti-p53 antibodies by EIA, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation: one individual at 11.3 and 10.8 years before diagnosis, another at 4 months before and shortly after diagnosis, and three when diagnosed or shortly thereafter. Four of the 77 vinyl chloride-exposed workers without diagnosed ASL were positive for anti- p53 antibodies; two of the four had symptoms related to vinyl chloride toxicity. Tumors from three of the six vinyl chloride-exposed workers from which sufficient DNA for analysis was obtained had A:T to T:A missense mutations of the p53 gene. Anti-p53 antibodies were detected in two of these individuals. Among the control group, two of 15 serum samples from 15 lung cancer patients and zero of 15 serum samples from control subjects without cancer had anti-p53 antibodies as substantially lower levels than the nine (10%) of 92 vinyl chloride- exposed workers who were positive for anti-p53 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Serum anti-p53 antibodies can predate clinical diagnosis of certain tumors, such as ASL, and may be useful in identifying individuals at high cancer risk, such as workers with occupational exposure to vinyl chloride",

    "Title": "Mutation of tumor suppressor gene p53 is frequently found in vulvar carcinoma cells",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence and type of mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in squamous carcinoma cell lines of the vulva. STUDY DESIGN: Eight low-passage cell lines established from vulvar carcinoma were included in the analysis. Mutational analysis was restricted to exons 5 through 9 of the p53 gene, previously shown to have a high incidence of mutations. The sequences containing exons 5/6,7, and 8/9 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and screened with a single-strand conformation polymorphism technique on PhastSystem (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Exons from samples showing mobility shifts in single-strand conformation polymorphism were sequenced by polymerase chain reaction direct sequencing. RESULTS: Five vulvar carcinoma cell lines showed abnormal electrophoretic mobility of exons 5/6, one of exons 8/9, and one of exon 7. Reduction to homozygosity was detected in four vulvar carcinoma cell lines. Missense mutations were detected by sequence analysis in UM-SCV-2 (codon 171: GAG[Glu]-->TAG[STOP]), UM-SCV-3 (hot spot codon 273: CGT[Arg]-->TGT[Cys]), UM-SCV-4 (codon 151: CCC[Pro]-- >CAC[His]), UM-SCV-5 (codon 155: ACC[Thr]-->ATC[lle]), and UM-SCV-7 (codon 245: GGC[Gly]-->AGC[Ser]). UM-SCV-3 also carried a missense mutation with no amino acid change (codon 314: TCC[Ser]-->TCT[Ser]). UM- SCV-7 carried an additional base deletion at codon 249 (AGG-->AG-), likely resulting in a frameshift in transcription and a truncated protein product. Four of the seven mutations were transitions, two were transversions, and one was a deletion. The presence of transitions suggests that at least a proportion of p53 mutations of these cancers may arise spontaneously without exogenous carcinogen exposure. UM-SCV- 1A and UM-SCV-1B were derived from the primary tumor and pleural effusion of the same patient. UM-SCV-6 is a cell line that contains human papillomavirus 16. No mutations in these three cell lines were found by single-strand conformation polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of previous observations, loss of tumor suppressor p53 function either by mutation or human papillomavirus involvement is a frequent phenomenon in cervical carcinoma cells. It appears now that functional inactivation of p53 is associated also with vulvar carcinoma cell lines, but mutations of the p53 gene are much more common in vulvar than in cervical carcinoma cell lines",

    "Title": "Screening for p53 gene mutations in archived tumors of workers occupationally exposed to carcinogens: examples from analysis of bladder tumors",
    "Abstract": "Point mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most common genetic alterations in human cancers. The nature and location of these mutations can be informative in assessing the importance of putative carcinogenic agents. Potential associations between a given carcinogen and a specific mutation pattern can be substantiated when the exposure history of the patients is known. While the past exposure to environmental risk factors is often difficult to determine, documented occupational exposure to carcinogens presents a unique situation for evaluating this approach. Analysis usually involves working with paraffin-embedded tissues, fixed under conditions suboptimal for genetic analysis and stored for many years, since frozen tissues are not available in sufficient numbers. The particular methodological problems encountered with fixed samples are discussed here, using as illustration an ongoing study of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene mutations in archived bladder tumors of workers exposed to aromatic amines and nonexposed patients",

    "Abstract": "We analyzed seven cases of anaplastic ependymoma, focusing on neuro- imaging, histopathology, and mutations of the tumour suppressor gene p53. Five of the seven tumours were supratentorial. All had both cystic and solid components, with fragment calcifications detectable on CT scan. The solid parts of the tumours were imaged as heterogenous hypo- or iso-intense areas with moderate enhancement on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Vascularity was not prominent on angiograms except for one case. Histologically, in addition to the WHO criteria, loss of typical cellular architecture, endothelial proliferation, and necrosis were commonly found. A mutation in Exon 5 of the tumour suppressor gene p53 was detected in one anaplastic ependymoma out of five tumours (two benign and three anaplastic ependymomas) examined by PCR-SSPC analysis of genomic DNA followed by direct sequencing. Anaplastic ependymoma typically presents as a calcified cystic tumour in the supratentorial parenchyma or transependyma. Mutations of p53 deserve further investigation to examine their possible role in the oncogenesis and malignant transformation of ependymoma",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations with chromosome 17 abnormalities in chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis patients persist in long-term cell lines but may be acquired in acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro",
    "Abstract": "Altered p53 tumor suppressor genes have been described in various human malignancies, including in chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML) and acute myelogenous leukemias (AML), as well as their derivative cell lines. It has been proposed that this gene mutation may be less frequent in myeloid leukemia patients than in myeloid leukemia cells lines and that the latter acquire these mutations during growth in vitro. We investigated this possibility by studying p53 gene alterations in matched samples of fresh leukemic cells and their respective derivative cell lines obtained from two CML blast crisis and one AML patient. No gross structural abnormalities were detected in the p53 gene in any of the samples analyzed. Discrete mutations in the gene in the two CML blast crisis samples and in all three derivative cell lines were, however, detected by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analyses and DNA sequencing. Cytogenetic analyses revealed either numerical or structural, as well as numerical, abnormalities of chromosome 17 in their karyotypes. Cells from the two CML blast crisis patients had two different mutations which were maintained as the sole mutations in the cell lines. The mutation detected in the AML cell line was, however, not detectable in the parental fresh leukemic cells. Our findings demonstrate that p53 mutations and chromosome 17 abnormalities occurring in CML blast crisis patients persist in long-term cell lines but that mutations not detectable in AML patients may indeed be acquired in cell lines established from them in vitro",

    "Title": "p53 mutation in epithelial ovarian carcinoma and borderline ovarian tumor",
    "Abstract": "We have investigated a series of 19 human ovarian carcinomas and 17 borderline ovarian tumors to determine the loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17p and possible concurrent p53 mutations. Allelic losses were assessed using restriction fragment length polymorphism study, and p53 gene mutations were detected by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and by direct sequencing. In addition, we stained the same tumor sections immunohistochemically to detect p53 protein in tissues. Among 19 ovarian malignant tumor samples tested, we identified 17p allelic deletions in 12 (63.2%) of 19 informative cases. The p53 gene mutation was observed in 7 of 19 (36.8%) malignant ovarian tumors, and it was predominantly observed in tumors with allelic loss on 17p (six of seven tumors, 85.7%). Although 9 cases of 17 borderline ovarian tumors showed shifted bands on single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, only one case was proved to have a point mutation in direct sequencing. We also obtained six cases (31.6%) of positive immunoreactivity from 19 ovarian cancers and 3 cases (17.6%) from 17 borderline ovarian tumors. We conclude that loss or inactivation of tumor suppressor gene function by chromosome 17p allelic deletions or p53 mutations are important genetic changes in ovarian cancer",

    "Title": "Constitutional p53 mutations associated with brain tumors in young adults",
    "Abstract": "Identification of patients at risk for developing brain tumors is important for the development of preventative strategies. Because individuals with germline p53 mutations may be at increased risk, we examined DNA from brain tumor-derived cell lines and malignant and normal nervous system tissue for p53 gene mutations using the single strand conformation polymorphism assay and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA. We found mutations in the p53 gene in eight of 22 adult glioma tissue specimens and germline mutations in two of these eight patients. In contrast, mutation of the p53 gene was not detectable in either 16 glial tumors occurring in children, glial tumor tissue from three unrelated glioblastoma multiforme patients with a familial history of cancer, or in benign meningiomas. One constitutional p53 mutation was a G to T transversion at codon 154, and the second was a C to T transition at codon 256. Both patients with germline mutations developed glioblastoma multiforme before the age of 31, although the median age for glioma patients is above 50. These findings suggest that p53 germline mutations may identify a subset of young adults predisposed to the development of high-grade astrocytic tumors",

    "Abstract": "TP53 gene mutations, one of the most common alterations described in human tumors, have also been detected in gastric carcinoma, and shown to occur rather late in disease progression. A better assessment of the prognostic value of TP53 gene mutations can be obtained by examining archival material, as this allows stored cases with well-defined histories to be monitored. We performed immunohistochemical and polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR- SSCP) analyses of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material from nine selected cases of gastric carcinoma at different pathological stages. PCR-SSCP analysis of TP53 exons 5-8 detected missense point mutations in two out of five immunostain(PAb1801)-positive tumors, and a deletion (allowing for a premature stop codon) in one of the remaining four immunostain-negative tumors. Thus, PCR-SSCP analysis represents a feasible strategy for the detection of TP53 alterations in archival material of gastric carcinoma cases",

    "Abstract": "Whilst p53 aberrations have been documented in numerous malignancies, reports of alterations to the deleted in colorectal cancer (dcc) gene are infrequent, and studies investigating the status of both genes in the same colon tumour are rare. In this study we have analysed a panel of 35 pairs of normal and neoplastic human colorectal tissues for abnormalities in these tumour-suppressor genes. In contrast to previous studies we have found only a low incidence of mutations and deletions. p53 point mutations were identified in 8/35 tumours (22%). All were G.C to A.T transitions, with 7/8 occurring at CpG dinucleotides. p53 allelic loss was detected in 4/11 informative cases (36%). Although not quite attaining statistical significance, p53 alteration correlated with the adenoma/carcinoma transition. Gross dcc alterations were identified by Southern blotting in 7/35 (20%) tumours. Microsatellite analysis using two markers, one within and one proximal to the dcc gene, detected a low frequency of deletion overall (41% informative cases). 18q/dcc aberrations were associated with the progression of early to late carcinoma, rather than with increasing adenoma size, as has been previously reported. Both p53 alterations and dcc deletions were detected at a higher frequency in distal tumours than in proximal malignancies. Two tumours exhibiting microsatellite instability in both markers were each of proximal origin",

The histogenesis of the latter is still a matter of debate. As mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene represent an early event in the development of gliomas, we attempted to determine whether both components of gliosarcomas share identical alterations of the p53 gene. Using single-strand conformation analysis (SSCA) and direct DNA sequencing of the p53 gene, we analyzed dissected gliomatous and sarcomatous parts of 12 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded gliosarcomas. The two tumors that contained a p53 alteration were found to carry the identical mutation (exon 5; codon 151, CCC-->TCC; codon 173, GTG --> GTA) in the gliomatous and the sarcomatous components. These findings suggest a common origin of the two cellular components from neoplastic glial cells.",

    "Title": "A simple p53 functional assay for screening cell lines, blood, and tumors",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 gene are implicated in the pathogenesis of half of all human tumors. We have developed a simple functional assay for p53 mutation in which human p53 expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae activates transcription of the ADE2 gene. Consequently, yeast colonies containing wild-type p53 are white and colonies containing mutant p53 are red. Since this assay tests the critical biological function of p53, it can distinguish inactivating mutations from functionally silent mutations. By combining this approach with gap repair techniques in which unpurified p53 reverse transcription-PCR products are cloned by homologous recombination in vivo it is possible to screen large numbers of samples and multiple clones per sample for biologically important mutations. This means that mutations can be detected in tumor specimens contaminated with large amounts of normal tissue. In addition, the assay detects temperature-sensitive mutants, which give pink colonies. We show here that this form of p53 functional assay can be used rapidly to detect germline mutations in blood samples, somatic mutations in tumors, and mutations in cell lines",

    "Title": "Characterization of a new human glioblastoma cell line that expresses mutant p53 and lacks activation of the PDGF pathway",
    "Abstract": "We have established and characterized a new glioblastoma cell line, termed GT9, from a biopsy sample of a female adult patient with glioblastoma multiforme. The line has now undergone over 60 passages and has been successfully cultured after cryopreservation. Immunofluorescence analyses with a panel of monoclonal antibodies were positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin, and negative for neurofilament, galactocerebroside, and fibronectin, a pattern typical of glial cells. Based on a tetraploid, the composite karyotype of GT9 cells included the loss of chromosome 10, gain of chromosome 7, and the presence of double minute chromosomes, three of the most common karyotypic abnormalities in glioblastoma. Sequence analysis of p53 cDNA revealed a homozygous double mutation at codon 249 (commonly mutated in aflatoxin-associated hepatocellular carcinoma) and codon 250. Moreover, there was a complete absence of wild-type p53. However, unlike the majority of human glioblastomas previously described, the expression of platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), a potent mitogenic autocrine factor, was low in GT9 cells. The expression and phosphorylation of c- Jun and Jun-B, downstream mediators of the PDGF pathway, were also low. Thus, deregulation of the PDGF pathway does not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of the GT9 glioblastoma. Conversely, Jun-D, a negative regulator of cell growth, was also low. In addition, Phosphorylated Egr-1, a recently reported suppressor of PDGF-B/v-sis- transformed cells, was also low, suggesting that the lack of activation of the PDGF pathway was not due to these suppressive mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

However, DNA sequencing showed that none of these three had mutations in the p53 gene. The remaining five premalignant lesions had no immunohistochemically detectable p53 protein.Conclusions-Some premalignant lesions have increased p53 protein which can be detected by staining with antibody to p53. This staining is not caused by mutations in p53 that are found in subsequent tumours at the same site.",

    "Title": "Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 in human liver cancer induced by alpha-particles",
    "Abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor gene is mutated in varying fractions of almost all tumor types studied. The rate of mutations and the mutational spectrum in some tumors are specific for environmental mutagens assumed to be involved in the carcinogenic process. Thus, hepatocellular carcinomas supposedly induced by aflatoxin exposure often contain a specific point mutation in codon 249, and in lung cancers of miners with heavy radon exposure, another specific point mutation in codon 249 suggestive of an alpha-particle-specific mutation has been shown. The interpretation of studies linking the mutational spectrum with specific environmental exposures is complicated by the multifactorial or unknown genesis of most tumors. However, people given injections of the X-ray contrast medium Thorotrast (Th) in the past have experienced an enormous risk of liver tumors, and virtually all of these are supposedly induced by alpha-particles from the decay of 232Th. The examination of these tumors may provide evidence as to whether specific p53 point mutations are relevant in alpha-particle carcinogenesis. Therefore, we collected paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed archival tissues from 18 hepatocellular carcinomas, 9 cholangiocarcinomas, and 9 hepatic angiosarcomas from Thorotrast-exposed patients. The tissues were analyzed for p53 protein expression by immunohistochemical staining by using the mAb DO-7 and for mutations of exons 5-8 by PCR and constant denaturant gel electrophoresis. G --> T transversions of the third base of codon 249 of the p53 gene were specifically screened for by restriction enzymes. No high score for p53 protein expression (i.e., positive staining of >20% of examined cells) was observed; lower scores were seen in 5 of 18 (28%) hepatocellular carcinomas, 1 of 9 (11%) cholangiocarcinomas, and 0 of 8 (0%) hepatic angiosarcomas. Only one p53 mutation, a heterozygous T --> G transversion of the first base codon 176, occurred in a hepatocellular carcinoma. The rate of p53 point mutations in alpha-particle-induced liver tumors seems to be lower than in European hepatocellular carcinomas in general. The study does not exclude the possibility that alpha-particle carcinogenesis may involve inactivation of p53 by gross deletions of the gene, but it speaks against the proposed specificity of point mutations of codon 249 in cancer supposedly induced by alpha-particles from radon progeny",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations and protein nuclear accumulation are early events in intestinal type gastric cancer but late events in diffuse type",
    "Abstract": "We screened for p53 alterations in 71 early gastric cancers of differing histological types and growth patterns, 18 advanced cancers of diffuse type, 19 dysplastic lesions, and 12 extensive intestinal metaplasia cases. Tumors were investigated for gene mutations (exons 5- 8) with PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing techniques, and for protein accumulation with immunohistochemical methods. Nontumor samples were studied with immunohistochemistry alone. Of the early cancers, intestinal tumors showed a much higher p53 mutation frequency (41%) than did diffuse cancers (4%). When comparing early and advanced tumors of the same type, we observed a similarity in mutation frequency (41 versus about 50%) for intestinal tumors, and a significant increase for diffuse tumors (from 4 to 33%). Immunopositive case distribution between tumor types and stages paralleled that of mutated cases. Immunohistochemical and genetic analysis gave concordant results for all samples with gene mutations. Eighteen of the 65 (28%) nonmutated tumors displayed significant immunoreactivity. Early tumors that massively penetrated the submucosa, i.e., the early tumors for which prognosis is worst, showed the highest frequency both of p53 gene mutation and of nonmutated protein accumulation. Twelve of 19 dysplastic lesions showed significant immunoreactivity, whereas intestinal metaplasias proved unreactive in all but a few cells. Our results yield two implications: that p53 alterations have a crucial and early role in gastric carcinogenesis of intestinal type, likely acting at the transition step between metaplasia and dysplasia; and that the alterations are mainly associated with tumor progression in cancer of diffuse type",

    "Title": "Mutations in the p53 gene in lung cancer are associated with cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure",
    "Abstract": "It has been proposed that the patterns of mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene will provide clues to the mechanisms of cancer occurrence. Cigarette smoking is known to be the greatest risk factor for lung cancer. Epidemiological evidence has also implicated radon and asbestos as exposures that significantly increase this disease risk; asbestos exposure synergistically enhances the lung cancer risk of smokers. Previous studies of the mutational spectra of the p53 gene in lung cancer have shown cigarette smoke and radon exposure to be associated with the induction of particular lesions or classes of lesions. We have investigated the p53 gene in surgically resectable lung cancers in 85 patients from the Massachusetts General Hospital. We found 25 (29%) patients to have somatic p53 mutations in their tumors. The patients with p53 mutations who were current smokers were significantly older (75.1 versus 59.8 years; P < 0.01 and had smoked for significantly more years (56.8 versus 41.2 years; P < 0.01) than had those without p53 changes. Consistent with other reports, we observed a large number (40%) of G:C to T:A transversion mutations, noting that their occurrence increased with increasing cumulative exposure to cigarette smoke. Interestingly, we also found that p53 mutations occurred significantly more frequently in patients with a history of occupational exposure to asbestos [3 of 60 (5%) for patients without p53 mutations versus 5 of 25 (20%) of those with p53 mutations; P < 0.05].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "Title": "The p53 gene in pediatric therapy-related leukemia and myelodysplasia",
    "Abstract": "We investigated the frequency of p53 mutations in 19 pediatric cases of therapy-related leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Eleven children presented with acute myeloid leukemia, one with mixed-lineage leukemia, two with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and five with myelodysplasia at times ranging from 11 months to 9 years after a primary cancer diagnosis. The primary cancers, which included 11 solid tumors and eight leukemias, were treated with various combinations of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, alkylating agents, or irradiation. Leukemic or myelodysplastic marrows were screened for possible mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of p53 exons 4 to 8. The only observed mutation was an inherited 2- basepair deletion at codon 209 in exon 6 that would shift the open reading frame, create a premature termination codon, and foreshorten the resultant protein. Prior therapy in this patient included DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, alkylating agents, and irradiation. The secondary leukemia presented as myelodysplasia with monosomies of chromosomes 5 and 7 and abnormalities of chromosome 17. Although the primary cancer was an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and there was a family history of cancer, the case did not fulfill the clinical criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. This study suggests that germline p53 mutations may predispose some children to therapy-related leukemia and myelodysplasia, but that p53 mutations otherwise are infrequent in this setting",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in mantle cell lymphoma are associated with variant cytology and predict a poor prognosis",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been described in several subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but the incidence of p53 mutations in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is unknown. We hypothesized that cases of MCL with avariant or high-grade cytology would have ah igher likelihood of p53 mutations than typical MCL. We were also interested in the prognostic significance of p53 mutations in MCL. Therefore, a series of 53 well-characterized cases ofMCL with DNA from 62 tissue samples were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction withdenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for exons 5-8 of p53. Immunoperoxidase studies with the antibody DO-7 to p53 protein were also performed on frozen section.  We found mutations of the p53 gene in 8 of the 53 cases (15%) of MCL. Missense mutations predominated, and 50% of the mutatins occurred at known p53 hotspot codons. Of 21 cases with variant cytology (ie, anaplastic or blastic), 6 (28.6%) had p53 mutations as compared with only 2 of 32 cases (6.3%) with typical MCL cytology (P =  .5), and p53 mutations preceded the development of variant cytology in 2 patients. Overexpression of p53 protein was observed in 6 of the 8 cases (75%) with p53 mutations and in none of the 45 wild-type cases. The median survival of the cases with mutant p53 was only 1.3 years (all died), whereas the median survival of cases with germline p53 was 5.1 years (P =  .023). The rersults suggest that mutations of p53 may be one mechanism involved in the development of variant forms of MCL and indicate that p53 mutations in MCL predict a poor prognosis.",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations and protein overexpression are associated with aggressive variants of mantle cell lymphomas",
    "Abstract": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is molecularly characterized by bcl-1 rearrangement and cyclin D1/PRAD-1 gene overexpression. Some aggressive variants have been recognized with a blastic or large cell morphology, higher proliferative activity, and shorter survival. p53 gene mutations in lymphoid neoplasms have been detected mainly in high grade lymphomas and have been associated with tumor progression in follicular and small lymphocytic lymphomas. To determine the role of p53 alterations in MCL, we examined 35 typical and 8 aggressive variants (5 blastic and 3 large cell) of MCLs by a combination of immunohistochemistry, single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of genomic DNA and/or cDNA obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and sequencing. Of the 8 aggressive MCLs, 3 (38%) contained missense point mutations in axon 8 codon 278 (Pro --> Leu), exon 8 codon 273 Arg --> His), and exon 5 codon 151 (Pro --> Ser), respectively. A diffuse p53 protein overexpression was observed in more than 50% of the tumor cells in these 3 cases. A fourth blastic MCL also showed strong p53 immunoreactivity. However, no mutations were detected in exons 5-9 in this case. p53 expression was also detected in 10% of the cells in an additional large cell type of MCL and in less than 1% of the cells in 6 typical cases. No mutations were detected in any of these cases or in the remaining cases with no expression of the protein. Four nucleotide changes were observed by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis in 4 typical MCLs with no overexpression of the protein. Direct sequencing showed that these nucleotide changes were located at exon 6 (1 case), intron 7 (2 cases), and intron 8 (1 case). The changes in exon 6 and intron 7 were known polymorphisms. The nucleotide change in intron 8 was outside splicing sites of the neighboring exons. The overall survival of the 3 patients with p53 mutations (median, 18.3 months) was significantly shorter than that of patients with the nonmutated MCLs (median, 49 months; P < .01). These findings indicate that p53 gene mutations are an infrequent phenomenon in MCLs and are associated with a subset of aggressive variants",

    "Title": "High incidence of potential p53 inactivation in poor outcome childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis",
    "Abstract": "Previous studies have indicated that p53 gene mutations were an uncommon event in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children. In one series of 330 patients, p53 mutations were seen in fewer than 3%. We analyzed bone marrow mononuclear cells derived from 10 children with ALL at diagnosis who subsequently failed to achieve a complete remission or who developed relapse within 6 months of attaining complete remission for p53 gene mutations and mdm-2 overexpression. We found that three children had p53 gene mutations, and four overexpressed mdm-2. Also, experiments comparing relative levels of mdm- 2 RNA and protein in these patients demonstrated that mdm-2 overexpression can occur at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level in primary leukemic cells. Although we were unable to link Waf-1 RNA expression with p53 status in childhood ALL, our data show potential p53 inactivation by multiple mechanisms in a large percentage of these patients and demonstrate that these alterations can be detected at diagnosis. Inactivation of the p53 pathway may, therefore, be important in children with ALL who fail to respond to treatment and may be useful for the early identification of children requiring alternative therapies",

    "Title": "p21/WAF1 cyclin-kinase inhibitor expression in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: a potential marker of p53 tumor-suppressor gene function",
    "Abstract": "p21WAF1 (wild-type p53-activated fragment 1) is involved in the control of mammalian cell cycle through the binding and inhibition of cyclin- dependent kinases (Cdk). Because the product of WAF1 gene is a potent downstream effector of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene function, its pattern of cellular expression might correlate with nuclear accumulation of p53-encoded protein and/or p53 gene mutations occurring in malignant lymphomas. To investigate this issue, we analyzed immunohistochemically the expression of p53 and p21WAF1 proteins in tissue involved by non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs;253 cases) of various histologic types. In a proportion of them (80 cases), we also investigated the possible presence of p53 gene mutations using single- strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing. The absence of both p21WAF1 and p53 proteins was observed in 147 of 217 cases (67.7%) among CD30-NHL and in only 8 of 36 (22.2%) CD30+cases, which were mostly anaplastic large-cell lymphomas. A consistent number (> 10%) of p21WAF1-expressing cells was shown in 48 of 253 (18.9%) NHL cases, with a higher incidence in CD30+cases (25/36 [69.4%]), which mostly (21/36) coexpressed p53. These latter cases were characterized by a germline configuration of the p53 gene. In 50 of 253 NHL samples (19.7%), 47 of which (21.6%) belong to the CD30-group, neoplastic cells were p53+/p21-. In all of these cases, the p53+cells accounted for more than 50% of neoplastic cells, up to 100%. Point mutations of p53 gene were solely observed in all investigated cases with this latter phenotype. Our findings strongly suggest that the combined immunohistochemical evaluation of p53 and p21WAF1 is a valuable means of assessing the functional status of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene product in NHL with potential application in the monitorage and prognostication of individual cases",

    "Title": "Microsatellite instability and p53 mutations in therapy-related leukemia suggest mutator phenotype",
    "Abstract": "During the last decade the frequency of therapy-related acute leukemia (t-leuk) and myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) has been increasingly observed. Over the past 15 years, we treated 56 patients with t-leuk who had received prior chemotherapy (39%), radiotherapy (11%), or both (45%). The drugs received included alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors. The primary tumors included hematological malignancies (49%) and solid tumors such as breast or ovarian cancer. The median age at diagnosis of the primary tumor was relatively young (43 years +/- 18). Twelve patients had more than one primary tumor and 31 patients had a family history of malignancy. Karyotypic abnormalities were found in 91% of the patients. Prognosis was uniformly poor, with an overall median survival of 10 months. Twelve of the 18 patients examined (67%) had a multidrug resistance phenotype. P53 genes of the leukemic cells, as well as the original tumors, were analyzed in 21 patients using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis followed by sequencing. P53 mutations were identified in 38% of these patients, a relatively high prevalence compared with other forms of MDS or de novo acute myeloid leukemia. Mutations were nongermline and restricted to the leukemic cells. We identified different p53 mutations in the various primary tumors of individual patients. The presence of a mutator phenotype was assessed by PCR analysis of microsatellites in eight loci (one trinucleotide repeat sequence, four dinucleotide, and three mononuclear repeat sequences). Microsatellite instability in two to seven loci were found in 15 of 16 (94%) of the patients. This instability is compatible with a mutator phenotype, which predisposes the patients to the development of malignancies including t-leuk",

    "Title": "p53 mutations do not predict response to paclitaxel/radiation for nonsmall cell lung carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 have been associated with resistance to ionizing radiation and chemotherapy. Paclitaxel and concurrent radiation (paclitaxel/RT) achieve high response rates with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). In vitro data and animal studies suggest that paclitaxel may have a unique ability to activate tumor cell apoptosis in the absence of wild-type p53 function. The authors sought to determine whether p53 mutations affect response to paclitaxel/RT in patients with locally advanced NSCLC. METHODS: Thirty patients with Stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC who participated in Brown University Oncology Group protocols utilizing paclitaxel/RT had tumor tissue that was adequate for analysis. Mutations were detected in tumor tissue by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene, and confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Mutations in p53 were found in 12 of 30 patients (40%). The response rates (complete plus partial) of 75% for patients with tumors with p53 mutations, and 83% for patients with wild-type p53, did not differ significantly (P = 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations do not predict response of patients with NSCLC to paclitaxel/RT. This finding is in striking contrast to results with other chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation. These clinical data support in vitro data and animal studies regarding the unique mechanism of the action of paclitaxel. Further investigation is needed to determine the mechanism of lung tumor cell death after paclitaxel/RT. These results suggest that paclitaxel/RT may be an active regimen for patients with other locally advanced neoplasms with high rates of p53 gene mutations",

    "Title": "p53 protein accumulation and gene mutations in multifocal esophageal precancerous lesions from symptom free subjects in a high incidence area for esophageal carcinoma in Henan, China",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. Multifocal occurrence of precancerous lesions of the esophagus has been observed among individuals in a high incidence area for esophageal carcinoma in Henan Province, China. Results from recent studies suggest that p53 protein accumulation and mutation occur early in the pathogenesis of esophageal carcinoma. Discordant p53 gene mutations have been observed in invasive carcinoma and preinvasive lesions from a patient with esophageal carcinoma. The p53 alterations in the multifocal precancerous lesions from symptom-free subjects, however, have not been investigated. METHOD. Two biopsy samples, one each from the middle-third and the lower-third of the esophagus, from each subject, were taken from 55 symptom-free subjects in a high incidence area for esophageal cancer in Huixian, Henan Province, China. p53 protein accumulation and p53 gene mutation were analyzed in the multifocal esophageal precancerous lesions from these subjects. RESULTS. Histopathologic examination showed that among the 110 biopsies, 20 had dysplasia, 72 had basal cell hyperplasia, and 18 had normal epithelia. Concurrent lesions at the middle- and lower-third biopsy occurred in 2 subjects with dysplasia (2 of 55 subjects, 4%) and 26 subjects with basal cell hyperplasia (26 of 55 subjects, 47%). Analysis by immunohistochemistry showed high concurrent rates of p53 protein accumulation (51 of 55 subjects, 93%). p53 sequence analysis of 32 samples from 16 subjects identified missense mutations in 5. In one subject, there were three different mutations in the middle-third biopsy (codon 161, GCC-->GAC) and the lower-third biopsy (codon 159, GCC-->CCC). A single mutation was detected in the other four subjects in either the middle- or lower-third biopsy. CONCLUSIONS. The present findings indicate that p53 protein accumulation and mutations occur in the early stages of human esophageal carcinogenesis. Independent somatic mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and protein accumulation in different regions of the esophageal 'field' might be key molecular events in multifocal esophageal carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Alterations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in carcinoma in situ of the testis",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Carcinoma in situ (CIS) is regarded as the precursor of all histologic variants of testicular germ cell tumors except spermatocytic seminoma. For a variety of human malignancies, alterations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been identified as prognostic factors for a poor clinical course. Discussions of the occurrence of p53 gene alterations in testicular carcinoma have been controversial. Immunohistochemical detection of the p53 oncoprotein has been reported in four of eight CIS cell areas adjacent to mature teratoma. The majority of investigations have failed to demonstrate p53 gene alterations on the DNA level in testicular carcinoma specimens. However, the genetic analysis of testicular carcinoma is complicated by the histologic variety of tumors, resulting in a mixture of subtypes undergoing moleculargenetic analysis. In the present study, CIS cells identified in normal testicular tissue adjacent to different testicular tumors were examined for alterations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. The authors believed that the detection of p53 alterations in CIS of the testis would not only support the idea of malignant potential in CIS but might also demonstrate the involvement of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in the development of germ cell cancers. METHODS: CIS cells were identified in the normal testicular tissue adjacent to 18 seminomatous and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors by histopathologic criteria and the immunohistochemical staining reaction for placental- like alkaline phos phase, a highly specific marker for testicular CIS. About 20-50 CIS cells per tumor were collected by a microdissection technique and were subjected to RNA. SSCP analysis and additional DNA- sequence analysis. RESULTS: In 12 of 18 cases (66%), RNA-SSCP analysis of the microdissected CIS cells revealed mutational band shifting at the p53 gene locus. In 7 of 18 cases (39%). the results of SSCP analysis were confirmed by DNA sequencing. DNA-sequence analysis revealed missense point mutations in the p53 gene in four cases (exon 5, codons 158, 170, and 176; exon 6, codon 213) and silent mutations in two cases (exon 5, codon 178; exon 6, codon 213). In one case, the identical missense point mutation (exon 5, codon 176) was detected in the CIS cells and also in the associated germ cell tumor. In two of six cases, different mutations were found in the CIS cells and the testicular tumor. In three cases in which DNA sequencing revealed point mutations in CIS cells, alterations of the p53 gene could not be detected in the examination of the associated tumor specimen. CONCLUSIONS: These findings appear to support the concept that malignant biologic characteristics are present in the in situ stage of testicular germ cell tumors. This is the first report demonstrating monoclonal development of a manifested testicular carcinoma from associated CIS cells on the basis of a certain mutational event in the p53 gene sequence. The involvement of p53 gene alterations in precursor cells of testicular carcinoma appears likely",

    "Title": "Morphologic, histologic, and molecular similarities between adenocarcinomas arising in the gastric stump and the intact stomach",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with gastric remnants resulting from partial resections have an increased risk for carcinoma. It is unclear whether adenocarcinoma arising in the gastric stump (GSca) differs from intact stomach carcinoma (Gca). The goal of this study was to examine the pathologic and molecular features of GSca and compare them with Gca. METHODS: Adjacent nonmalignant areas and tumors from 14 patients who were 19-55 years postgastrectomy (mean, 32.1 years) were compared with 14 Gca by pathologic and molecular analysis. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded specimens were immunohistochemically stained for p53 followed by topographic genotyping. Exons 5-8 were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and directly sequenced. RESULTS: No differences were noted between the two groups regarding gender, types of metaplasia, dysplasia, morphology, or histologic tumor type. However, a higher incidence of cystic dilatation and foveolar hyperplasia were present in GSca. p53 gene point mutations occurred in 5 of 14 (35.7%) GSca patients. GSca p53 mutations included missense point mutations (G:A transitions in four patients and G:C transversion in one patient) with allelic loss. In four of the five patients with p53 mutations, the same mutation was also observed in the adjacent area. p53 point mutations were present in 4 of 14 Gca (28.6%), in exons 5, 6, and 8. In one case, the same mutation was also detected in the adjacent nonmalignant mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Similarities in clinical, pathologic, and molecular features between GSca and Gca suggest the possibility that they share similar mechanisms of carcinogenesis. p53 gene alterations in premalignant areas may denote a possible early role of this gene in gastric carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. Alterations of the suppressor genes, such as the retinoblastoma (RB), p53, p16(CDKN2), and p15 genes, have been reported in human gliomas. These genes have been suggested as the cell cycle regulatory genes at the G1-S checkpoint. METHODS. Alterations of the RB, p53, p16(CDKN2), and p15 genes in human astrocytomas were screened by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction products (PCR-SSCP analysis) and then confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. In addition, the expression of RB and p16 protein was examined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS. Aberrations of the RB gene were found in 3 of 23 surgical astrocytoma specimens (13%). Mutations were found at codon 754 in exon 22 (Val-->Gly), codon 519 in exon 17 (Thr-->Pro), and one base deletion at codon 903 resulting in stop codon at codon 905 in exon 26. These mutational locations were all near the regions associated with the functional domains of the RB gene. Aberrations of the p53 gene were found in 4 cases (17.4%). These mutations were found at codons 146 (Trp-->Gly) and 165 (Gln-->His) in exon 5, codon 73 (Val-->Glu) in exon 4, and codon 313 (Ser-->Asn) in exon 9. In addition, alterations of the p16(CDKN2) gene were found, with 5 cases (21.7%) having homozygous deletions, and 2 cases (8.7%) harboring point mutations. No p15 gene alteration was detected. The expression of p16 protein was undetectable in 10 cases (43.5%) by Western blot analysis, demonstrating an inverse correlation with the expression of RB protein. CONCLUSIONS. A few cases had overlapping alterations, and the incidence of one or more RB, p53, or p16(CDKN2) changes appeared to be relatively high in human astrocytomas. These results suggest that cell cycle regulatory gene alterations may play an important role in the development of gliomas",

    "Title": "p53 immunohistochemical and genetic alterations are associated at high incidence with post-irradiated locally persistent prostate carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Several reports have shown that cells with p53 mutations display increased resistance to ionizing radiation, a treatment often used clinically for localized prostate carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Totals of 18 post-irradiated locally recurrent prostatic carcinoma specimens and 25 (no radiation) stage D1 node-positive (TxN+MO) primary prostatic carcinoma specimens were tested for p53 immunoreactivity by immunohistochemistry. Of the 18 post-radiation locally recurrent prostatic carcinomas 10 were further analyzed by single strand conformational polymorphism to assess the validity of using this immunohistochemistry approach in irradiated tissue for detecting p53 alterations. Specimens showing p53 alterations by single strand conformational polymorphism were subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis or tested for loss of heterozygosity at a locus within the p53 gene. RESULTS: Of the 25 stage TxN+MO prostatic carcinomas without radiation 5 (20%) were immunoreactive (consistent with the reported incidence of positive immunoreactivity in clinical/surgical stage TxN+MO primary prostatic carcinomas). In contrast, 13 of 18 post-radiation locally recurrent prostatic carcinoma specimens (72%) were immunoreactive. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed no dependence of p53 immunoreactivity to grade, stage or androgen status in the post-radiation locally recurrent prostatic carcinoma group, while 8 of 10 hormone naive prostatic carcinoma specimens (80%) were immunoreactive. The temporal relationship between p53 alterations and radiotherapy was assessed. Pre-irradiation prostatic carcinomas available from 5 patients with immunoreactive post- radiation locally recurrent disease were analyzed and all were immunoreactive. CONCLUSIONS: p53 Alteration in localized prostatic carcinoma is uncommon. Our study confirms others in that even aggressive locally advanced nonirradiated primaries (stage TxN+MO) contain only 20% incidence of p53 alterations. However, our study demonstrates that p53 alterations are found in the preponderant majority of post-radiation locally recurrent prostatic carcinoma specimens. Limited evaluation of pretreatment prostatic carcinoma biopsies uniformly documented the presence of p53 alterations before ionizing radiation, thereby demonstrating that p53 alteration was already present and was not radiation-induced or only correlated with late stage disease. This finding suggests a potential for p53 immunoreactivity to be used as a pretreatment marker that might predict local treatment failure with ionizing radiation. Large scale prospective trials would appear warranted to evaluate conclusively the potential prognostic applicability of p53 pre-screening before enrollment in definitive radiotherapy",

    "Title": "Specific P53 mutations are associated with de novo resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer patients",
    "Abstract": "The mechanisms causing resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer patients are poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that different forms of chemotherapy may exert their cytotoxic effects by inducing apoptosis. The tumor suppressor gene P53 has a pivotal role inducing apoptosis in response to cellular damage. In vitro investigations have shown intact p53 to play a critical role executing cell death in response to treatment with cytotoxic drugs like 5-fluorouracil, etoposide and doxorubicin. Recently, mutations in the P53 gene were found to confer resistance to anthracyclines in a mouse sarcoma tumor model, and overexpression of the p53 protein (which, in most cases, is due to a mutated gene) was found to be associated with lack of response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer. Previous studies have shown mutations in the P53 gene or overexpression of the p53 protein to predict a poor prognosis, but also a beneficial effect of adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy in breast cancer. In this study we present data linking specific mutations in the P53 gene to primary resistance to doxorubicin therapy and early relapse in breast cancer patients",

    "Title": "Alterations of p53 and expression of WAF1/p21 in human thyroid tumors",
    "Abstract": "We have investigated p53 expression in 178 thyroid tumors from 162 patients by immunohistochemistry using two antibodies, DO1 and CM1. In addition, 35 tumors were analyzed for expression of WAF1/p21, one of the downstream mediators of p53. Only 15 tumors (8.4%) had greater than 10% of tumor cell nuclei positively stained for p53. Six of 14 Hurthle tumors and three of 34 papillary thyroid carcinomas showed staining of p53 in the cytoplasm. A total of 40 tumors, including all p53 positive tumors, and all anaplastic and poorly differentiated tumors were screened for mutations in exons 5-8 of the TP53 gene by constant denaturing gel electrophoresis and subsequent sequence analysis. A mutation was detected in five tumors only: one anaplastic carcinoma, one poorly differentiated follicular carcinoma (negative by p53 immunohistochemistry), one atypical follicular adenoma, and two papillary thyroid carcinoma metastases, of which the primary tumors had no detectable mutation. We conclude that p53 immunohistochemistry cannot be used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in thyroid tumors. The tumors with TP53 mutation showed a markedly reduced WAF1/p21 expression. Three anaplastic carcinomas with highly expressed p53, but with no detectable mutation, also showed high expression of WAF1/p21. This may be explained by overexpression of wild-type p53, possibly due to the patients' preoperative treatment, including external radiation of the neck region. The results indicate that WAF1/p21 immunohistochemistry contributes to the information of the functional status of p53, and may facilitate the interpretation of results from p53 immunohistochemistry in these tumors",

    "Title": "Potential false-positive results with antigen enhancement for immunohistochemistry of the p53 gene product in colorectal neoplasms",
    "Abstract": "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for intranuclear p53 gene product is a simple, routine alternative to molecular genetic analysis of the p53 gene. Several methods for antigen enhancement are currently in use for IHC. This study evaluates the effect of extreme antigen enhancement for p53, using a monoclonal antibody (DO7) and a polyclonal antibody (CM1). The cases studied were five colorectal carcinomas, two specimens of normal colorectal mucosa, and four colorectal carcinomas with genetic alterations which are expected to preclude p53 gene product expression, namely mutation to a STOP codon in the p53 gene detected by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis with subsequent sequencing and allelic loss of 17p in the region where p53 is located, detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The findings suggest that extreme antigen enhancement may cause false-positive results with a distinct nuclear staining pattern when MAb DO7 is used as a primary antibody. It is concluded that all antigen enhancement methods should be thoroughly tested to evaluate their validity and that there may be a limit to the extent to which antigen enhancement can be applied in IHC for p53 protein",

    "Title": "Prevalence of mutations of ras and p53 in benign and malignant thyroid tumors from children exposed to radiation after the Chernobyl nuclear accident",
    "Abstract": "Starting 4 years after the Chernobyl accident, a dramatic increase in incidence of thyroid carcinoma was noticed in children from contaminated areas. The incidence of benign thyroid lesions in the exposed population was also increased. To study the possible role of ras and p53 genes in radiation-induced thyroid tumorigenesis, 33 papillary carcinomas, one follicular carcinoma and 22 benign lesions removed from children aged 5-19 were screened for point mutations of H- , K-, and N-ras, as well as of p53 (exons 5-8) using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Ras point mutations were detected in 1/1 case of follicular carcinoma (N-ras codon 61 CAAgln-- >AAAlys), and in 3/7 follicular adenomas (N-ras codon 61 CAAgln-- >CGAarg x 2, CAAgln-->AAAlys). None of the cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma was positive for ras oncogene abnormalities. The lack of K- ras mutations was confirmed by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization (ASOH), and by sequencing in five cases. Somatic point mutations in p53 were found by SSCP in 2/33 papillary thyroid carcinomas, with one missense mutation (exon 5, codon 160 ATGmet-- >GTGval) and another silent mutation (codon 182, TGCcys-->TGTcys). Immunohisto-chemically, focally positive p53 staining was found in four papillary carcinomas being primarily confined to solid and poorly- differentiated areas in tumors. These data demonstrate that as opposed to the few reports on tumors arising after therapeutic external irradiation, ras mutations are not primary events in the development of post-Chernobyl thyroid papillary carcinomas. p53 mutations do not appear to be important in the development of these tumors, but may in some cases have a role in progression to a more aggressive phenotype that has not yet fully manifested in these pediatric neoplasms",

    "Title": "Soft tissue sarcoma metastasis from clonal expansion of p53 mutated tumor cells",
    "Abstract": "Although soft tissue sarcoma has a high incidence of p53 mutations, it is not clear if such alterations facilitate tumor growth and metastasis. In this study, fresh autologous normal lymphocytes, normal muscle, primary and metastatic sarcoma tissues from a single synovial sarcoma patient were examined for p53-related alterations that potentially associated with sarcoma tumor development and metastasis. Normal tissues contain two wild-type p53 alleles. Primary sarcoma had one chromosome 17p p53 allelic deletion without apparent p53 mutation in the other allele. However, metastatic tumor had deletion of one p53 allele with an exon 5 codon 135 missense mutation in the other allele. This p53 gene point mutation in the metastasis was associated with the production of mutated p53 protein. A small clone of cells harboring the identical p53 gene point mutation was identified in the primary tumor using mutant allele specific PCR amplification, albeit at levels much less than in the metastatic sarcoma. This single patient example indicate that soft tissue sarcoma metastasis can develop from clonal expansion of primary tumor cells bearing p53 mutations",

    "Title": "Characterization of genomic alterations associated with glioma progression by comparative genomic hybridization",
    "Abstract": "Genomic alterations associated with glioma progression were determined by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) 30 tumors from 15 patients with primary gliomas of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II that on recurrence showed progression to malignant gliomas of WHO grades III or IV (five cases of astrocytoma grade II (A II) to grade III (AA III), five cases of A II to glioblastoma multiforme grade IV (GBM) and five cases of oligodendroglioma grade II (O II) to grade III (AO III)). All tumors were additionally screened for p53 mutations by single strand conformational polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis of exons 5-8, followed by direct sequencing. Mutations of p53 were found in the primary and recurrent tumors of all cases of A II progressing to GBM and three of five cases of A II recurring as AA III. Alterations identified by CGH in more than one primary A II included losses on Xp (3/10) and 5p (2/10), gains on 8q and 19p (2/10 each), and gain/amplification on 12p (2/10). Common progression associated changes found in AA III or GBM were losses on 4q, 9p, 10q, 11p, 13q (4/10 each) and gains on 1q, 6p, 20q (2/10 each). The most frequent amplification site was located on 12p13 (1/10 A II, 3/5 AA III, 1/5 GBM). Other amplified chromosomal regions were 13q32-q34 (1/10 AII, 2/5 GBM), 7q31- qter (1/5 AA III, 1/5 GBM), 12q22-qter and 18p (1/5 AA III). In contrast to the astrocytic gliomas, only one of five oligodendroglial cases showed a p53 mutation. Genetic abnormalities identified by CGH to occur more than once were restricted to four chromosomes (1, 4, 9 and 19). Our results provide a comprehensive overview of the genomic alterations associated with the progression of individual gliomas and substantiate the hypothesis that glioma progression is associated with a cumulative acquisition of multiple genetic changes",

    "Abstract": "p53 mutations are the most common genetic alterations found in human malignancies. However current estimates of p53 alterations in cancers may be inaccurate because there is evidence that current approaches do not detect all p53 alterations. In this study we determine the status of the p53 gene by complete DNA sequencing of exons 2 through 11 as well as immunohistochemical staining in cohorts of primary human breast, ovarian and non small cell lung cancer. Overall, 24 of 93 (26%) breast cancers, 62 of 108 (57%) ovarian cancers and 88 of 154 (57%) non small cell lung cancers contained DNA sequence mutations, whereas positive immunohistochemical staining was detected in 15 of 64 (23%) breast, 35 of 94 (37%) ovarian, and 63 of 137 (46%) lung cancers. Of those tumors that contained mutations, the mutation occurred outside the 'hot-spot' region in 19% of breast, 18% of ovarian and 17% of lung tumors, indicating that a substantial number of mutations remain undetected in studies that are restricted to exons 5 through 9. We observed a high concordance between the presence of p53 missense mutations and positive immunohistochemical staining, but a poor concordance between other types of mutations and staining in all three types of malignancies. We conclude that a combination of DNA sequence analysis of exons 2 through 11 and immunohistochemical staining are required to detect all known alterations in the p53 gene in human malignancies",

    "Title": "An abundance of p53 null mutations in ovarian carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Ovarian cancers from 64 midwestern US women were screened for p53 dysfunction both by immunohistochemical staining (IHCS) and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the entire open reading frame (ORF). Forty SSCP abnormalities in 39 tumors included nine deletion, one insertion, two splice junction, two nonsense, one silent and 25 missense mutations were confirmed by direct genomic sequencing. Eight of the insertion/deletion defects may have occurred due to slippage during the course of DNA replication. This observation suggests that genomic instability may play an important role in ovarian carcinogenesis. Fifteen percent of the mutations encountered were located outside exons 5-9 and four of these were null. The sensitivity of IHCS was 96% for missense mutations but only 14% for null mutations. This contrasted with 100% sensitivity of the SSCP screening methodology. The 21% overall incidence of null mutations in the present study far exceeds the reported 6.8% incidence in the world literature (P=0.0003). Explanations for this difference include: (1) our complete analysis of the entire ORF of the p53 gene; (2) the tendency of others to rely upon IHCS to screen tumors prior to mutation analysis; and (3) environmental or endogenous genetic influences",

    "Abstract": "Comparison of acquired mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene can illuminate factors contributing to carcinogenesis among cancer cohorts. Japan has an ethnically homogeneous population with a low incidence of breast cancer. Previously we reported an unusual frequency, allelic status, and clustering of mutations in breast cancers from the northern part of the main Japanese island. To extend these findings, exons 2-11 and adjacent intronic sequences were analysed in tumors of women from northern (Hokkaido) and southern (Tokushima) Japan. The frequency of breast cancers with p53 gene mutations in the Hokkaido group is the highest reported (81%) while that in Tokushima (28%) is similar to most other populations. Thirteen of the 19 mutations (68.4%) in the Hokkaido cohort were heterozygous, an unusually high frequency for p53 mutations in any tumor type. There were three missense mutations at codon 175, a known hotspot for alterations in the p53 gene, and three missense mutations at codon 179, a rare site for p53 changes. In addition, the patterns of p53 gene mutation differed between the two Japanese cohorts (P=0.04). The multiple differences in acquired p53 mutations suggest unsuspected biological differences among breast cancers in northern and southern Japan. In addition, the high frequency of p53 mutations in breast cancers from Hokkaido predicted a poorer prognosis for this population which was confirmed on examination of mortality data",

    "Title": "Inverse correlation between RER+ status and p53 mutation in colorectal cancer cell lines",
    "Abstract": "The high point mutation rate of replication error-prone (RER+) cells could theoretically lead to inactivation of the p53 gene by polyclonal mutations, which might explain the conflicting results that have been published on the p53 status of RER+ colon cancers. To address this issue, we tested the p53 status of 21 human colorectal cancer cell lines, including four showing microsatellite instability (RER+ phenotype). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) followed by sequencing showed that all four RER+ cell lines were wild type for p53 while 15 of the 17 RER- cell lines contained p53 mutations (P=0.001). Eight cell lines (four RER+ and four RER-) were analysed using three complementary methods to test more rigorously the polyclonal mutation hypothesis. (i) Of 87 single-cell clones (seven to 14 per cell line) examined by DGGE, only those derived from known p53 mutant cell lines showed altered profiles. (ii) Antibody DO-7 stained more than 80% of nuclei from the p53 mutant cell lines, but only 15% of nuclei from the RER+ cell lines. (iii) A yeast functional assay which can simultaneously detect polyclonal mutations at over 500 different sites in the p53 cDNA scored all four RER+ cell lines as containing only transcriptionally active p53. These data thus do not support the polyclonal mutation hypothesis and instead suggest that mismatch repair deficiency provides a p53-independent pathway for development of colorectal cancers",

    "Abstract": "Two screening techniques for identifying point mutations (single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and dideoxyfingerprinting (ddF)) were compared to sequencing to determine their efficiency in detecting mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Twelve human glioblastoma cell lines were studied by each of the three methods. Ten mutations were identified by sequencing; of these, 10/10 were detected by ddF, while SSCP detected 6/10 true mutations and falsely identified two presumed mutations not confirmed by sequencing. We examined the impact of parameters which influence DNA conformation (gel temperature, gel composition, and PCR product size) on the ability of SSCP and ddF to detect mutations. The sensitivity of SSCP varied with both gel temperature and the size of the PCR product; in contrast, ddF was not influenced by either gel temperature or product length (up to 460 nucleotides). We conclude that the increased sensitivity of ddF, together with its greater ease of application due to the lack of need for optimization, provides significant advantages over SSCP in screening DNA sequences for the presence of point mutations. Our results also suggest that the incidence of p53 mutations may be underestimated in studies of human cancers which utilize SSCP as the method of mutational screening",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma involves activation of the Ki-ras oncogene, inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, and dysregulation of growth factors and perhaps metastasis genes. Ki-ras oncogene point mutations are known to be involved in pancreatic oncogenesis. The p53 tumor suppressor gene product plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation and also functions as a nuclear transcription factor. Point mutations in the p53 gene have been observed in a variety of malignancies. We determined the frequency of p53 protein overexpression and p53 point mutations in the conserved and nonconserved domains in pancreatic cancers as well as the coincidence of Ki-ras mutation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Genomic DNA was isolated from 20 frozen pancreatic adenocarcinomas (14 primary, six metastases) along with six specimens of control pancreatic tissue and screened by single- strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis followed by direct genomic sequencing of SSCP variants. SSCP analysis was accomplished by incorporating 32P-dCTP in 12 separate polymerase chain (PCR) amplifications covering the p53 coding exons 2-11. All mobility shifts on SSCP were subjected to direct genomic sequencing by the modified dideoxy method. Immunoperoxidase (IP) staining was also done with a p53 monoclonal antibody. Ki-ras codon 12 mutational analysis was accomplished by incorporating 32P-dCTP by polymerase chain reaction amplification utilizing mismatched primers, which create a BstN1 restriction endonuclease site spanning codon 12; the products were digested by BstN1. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis allowed distinction between wild-type and mutant Ki-ras. p53 mutations were found in 5 of 20 pancreatic cancers (three of 14 primary tumors, two of six metastatic tumors). Point mutations were observed in three of 14 primary tumors, and one of six metastases, while a 2-base pair duplication resulting in a premature stop codon in exon 5 was found in one metastatic tumor. Point mutations were noted in conserved domains (exons 4, 5, 8) and in the nonconserved domain (exon 10). IP staining revealed that eight of 14 of the primary tumors and two of six metastases exhibited moderate to strong nuclear staining (> 30%), while no nuclear staining was evident in the controls. Ki-ras codon 12 mutations were found in 14 of 20 (70%) pancreatic cancers (nine of 14 primary tumors, five of six metastatic tumors) and none of the six controls. Fifty percent of the primary pancreatic tumors demonstrated moderate to strong nuclear staining. Extensive genetic analysis demonstrated mutations in 30% of the pancreatic cancers. One cancer had a nonsense mutation not detected by IP. Seven of 19 (37%) pancreatic cancers exhibited both Ki-ras point mutation and p53 protein overexpression or mutation. Both genetic analysis and IP are required to characterize all p53 mutations in pancreatic cancer. Ki-ras codon 12 mutations and p53 protein overexpression are important steps in pancreatic oncogenesis",

    "Abstract": "The relationship between integration with human papillomavirus (HPV) and p53 gene mutations in tissues of prostate cancer were examined. Tissue samples analyzed were obtained by total prostatectomy (29 stage B cancer cases) and from autopsy (22 endocrine therapy-resistant metastatic disease cases). HPV DNA was detected in 8 of 51 (16%, 5 in stage B and 3 in autopsy cases) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using consensus primers on L1 region. Genotypes of HPV were entirely type 16. Structural abnormalities of p53 gene were detected in 7 of the 22 autopsy cases (32%) by PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. No p53 gene mutation was found in stage B cancer cases. Analysis of mutation spectra revealed clear differences between Japanese and Westerners. There was a significant difference in the mutation frequency between stage B and autopsy cases (p < 0.01, Fisher's exact test). One case showed both integration of HPV and p53 gene mutation in different cancer foci. However, the other cases revealed an inverse correlation between the presence of HPV DNA and p53 gene mutations. These data show that p53 genetic alteration is correlated with the progression of prostate cancer, in contrast to the integration of HPV that may occur in a relatively early stage. In conclusion, this study may indicate that either p53 gene mutation or the presence of HPV's oncogenic protein E6 is involved in the development of prostate cancer",

    "Abstract": "To investigate the molecular mechanism of gastric carcinogenesis, we analyzed genetic instability and p53 gene mutations in 40 primary gastric carcinomas. Tumor samples were from untreated patients with no family history suggestive of genetic predisposition to cancer. We screened six microsatellite loci by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, and exons 5-8 of the p53 gene by the PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing techniques. Microsatellite instability was detected in 32.5% (13/40), and gene mutations in 40% (16/40), of the tumors analyzed. No statistically significant associations were found between genetic alterations and clinico- pathological variables (with the exception of diffusion of lymph node metastases, which was inversely associated with the presence of microsatellite alterations; P < 0.01). Interestingly, a negative association was found between genetic instability and p53 gene mutations: 11 out of 13 tumors showing instability proved to carry a nonmutated p53 gene versus 2/13 carrying a mutated gene (P = 0.03). These observations suggest that genetic instability and p53 gene mutations play a crucial role in the gastric carcinogenic process, but likely act through distinct pathways during cancer development. However, genetic instability is not in and of itself neoplastic. Therefore, we investigated whether insertion/deletion mutations of the polyadenine tract within the transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor gene (TGF-beta RII) were frequently present in gastric tumors with an RER+ (replication error) phenotype. We found RII mutations in 8/40 (20%) samples: mutations were present in 7/13 (54%) RER+ tumors versus 1/27 (4%) RER- cases (P < 0.001)",

In one case we have analyzed biopsy specimens taken from the same site, one year before the patient developed an intra mucosal carcinoma. The mutation that was identified in this high grade dysplastic area was identical to that detected in the cancer. This would suggest TP53 mutations occur as an early genetic event in the development of Barrett's adenocarcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene result in an altered response to DNA-damaging agents. Included in the mutant p53 phenotype are the loss of the G1 checkpoint and delayed apoptotic cell death, characteristics we have consistently observed in the AHH-1 tk+/- cell line following exposure to DNA-damaging agents. In order to determine the functional status of p53 in the AHH-1 tk+/- cell line, molecular analysis (single-strand conformational polymorphism [SSCP] and sequence analysis) was performed on exons 5-9 of the p53 gene. In addition, the status of the p53 gene in the closely related lymphoblast line, MCL-5, which, in our hands, has a much higher spontaneous rate of apoptosis than AHH-1 tk+/-, was also determined by molecular analysis. Initial SSCP analysis of AHH-1 tk+/- revealed an abnormal migration pattern of exon 8 when compared to a wild-type control. Subsequent sequence analysis indicated that a base-pair substitution (CGG-->TGG) mutation had occurred at codon 282, a reported 'hot spot' for 5- methylcytosine mutations in the human p53 gene. Neither SSCP nor sequence analysis of exons 5-9 of MCL-5 indicated any differences from wild-type DNA. These results suggest that the lack of a G1 arrest and the delayed entrance into apoptosis observed in chemically-exposed AHH- 1 tk+/- cells are, at least partially, accounted for by a loss-of- function mutation in the p53 gene",

To determine the role of p53 inactivation in the progression of clinical prostatic carcinomas, we assessed 67 tumors derived from patients with clinically localized disease for chromosome 17p and p53 gene allelic loss, p53 gene mutations using single-strand conformational polymorphism and direct sequencing, and p53 protein expression using immunohistochemical staining. Of 55 informative tumors, 10 demonstrated loss of 17p or the p53 gene; however, only a single tumor had a mutation in its remaining p53 allele. Significant p53 overexpression was observed in 2 of 38 tumors, and 9 others had faint staining of a few nuclei ( < 1%). p53 overexpression occurred in no informative tumor with allelic loss or mutation. In a 1-7-year follow-up, positive immunohistochemical staining did not confer an increased risk of recurrence (risk of recurrence, 0.86, P = 0.78), whereas allelic loss of chromosome 17p appeared to be highly correlated with recurrence (risk of recurrence, 3.7, P = 0.003). In an unrelated group of 42 patients with metastatic prostate cancer, p53 overexpression was found in 26 tumors (62%), and 15(36%) had high grade staining. Neither the presence nor the degree of expression correlated with time to progression or time to death. This series suggests that p53 gene inactivation is rare in primary prostatic tumors, not essential to the development of prostate cancer metastases, and of limited use as a prognostic marker in patients with primary or metastatic disease. Another gene or genes on chromosome 17p may be involved in prostate cancer progression",

    "Title": "Association between cisplatin resistance and mutation of p53 gene and reduced bax expression in ovarian carcinoma cell systems",
    "Abstract": "P53 status may be a determinant of chemosensitivity of tumor cells; however, its involvement in cellular resistance to cisplatin remains uncertain. To investigate the relationships between p53 and the development of resistance to cisplatin, the p53 gene status was studied in ovarian carcinoma cell systems which included two cisplatin- resistant variants (IGROV-1/Pt 0.5 and IGROV-1/Pt 1) selected in vitro after prolonged drug exposure of the cisplatin-sensitive parental IGROV- 1 cell line. IGROV-1/Pt 0.5 and IGROV-1/Pt 1 cell lines exhibited a degree of resistance of approximately 6 and 14, respectively, following 96-h exposure to the drug and were cross-resistant to other DNA- damaging agents (ionizing radiation and melphalan). Resistance to cisplatin paralleled a reduced cell susceptibility to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. DNA single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 5-9 demonstrated the presence of two mutants alleles at exon 8 in the two resistant cell lines, in contrast to the parental IGROV-1 cell line which exhibited the wild-type p53 gene. Direct DNA sequencing revealed that the mutations consist of two nucleotide changes in the DNA-binding domain at codons 270 (T/A) and 282 (C/T). The consecutive levels of p53 protein were lower in IGROV-1 than in IGROV-1/Pt cells. Following exposure to ionizing radiation or cisplatin, accumulation of the p53 protein was markedly enhanced only in the sensitive cells. Concomitantly, the expression of WAF-1 protein was strongly induced in the parental IGROV-1 cells, whereas WAF-1 protein remained undetectable in the IGROV-1/Pt 1 subline after DNA-damaging treatment. Consistent with this finding is the observation that ionizing radiation caused a different pattern of cell cycle perturbation in sensitive and resistant cells. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a marked reduction in bax mRNA levels in IGROV-1/Pt 1 cisplatin-resistant cells. Cotransfection assays with wild-type or mutant p53 expression plasmids and a reporter gene plasmid that utilized the bax gene promoter to drive transcription of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase were consistent with the role of p53 in regulation of bax expression in these cells. Taken together, these observations support a role for mutations of the p53 gene in the development of cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer as a consequence of loss of the ability of p53 to transactivate bax, an apoptosis- inducing gene",

    "Title": "A comparative study of p53 gene mutations, protein accumulation, and response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in advanced ovarian carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "The p53 protein is a multifunctional transcriptional regulator involved in cellular response to DNA damage and has been implicated as a putative determinant of sensitivity of tumor cells to cytotoxic agents. Since the p53 gene becomes inactivated in over one-half of advanced ovarian carcinoma, in this study we have examined the relationships between p53 gene alterations, p53 immunoreactivity, and response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients. All patients had advanced (FIGO stage III or IV) ovarian carcinoma and, with one exception, were untreated at the time of collection of tumor specimens. After initial debulking surgery, patients received high-dose cisplatin therapy. Tumor samples were analyzed for p53 gene mutations and for p53 protein accumulation, and the findings were correlated with tumor responsiveness. Of the 33 tumors examined, p53 gene mutations were found in 20 cases, including 15 missense mutations, 2 deletions, 2 nonsense mutations, and a base substitution at splice site. Twenty tumors showed positive immunostaining for p53. Only missense mutations were associated with positive immunostaining. In addition, p53 overexpression was detected in five tumors in the absence of mutations. Most (12 of 14) of the missense mutations associated with p53 protein stabilization were found refractory to therapy, as well as tumors overexpressing wild-type p53 (4 of 5). A significant correlation has been found between p53 accumulation, type of mutation (i.e., missense mutations), and pathological response to cisplatin-based therapy. In conclusion, the present results are consistent with a role of p53 as a determinant of chemosensitivity of ovarian carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the prognostic value of p53 mutation type for 145 soft tissue sarcoma patients. In a PCR-SSCP-sequencing analysis, 15 mutations were identified: 10 non-frameshift (non-fs) and 5 frameshift (fs) mutations. Patients possessing non-fs mutations had a significantly poorer prognosis than patients without p53 mutations (P = 0.014), according to Cox's multivariate analysis. In contrast, the survival of five patients with fs mutations was not affected by their mutation type. Furthermore, occurrence of lymph node metastases and recurrences was correlated with the mutation type; i.e., 4 of 10 and 5 of 10 patients with non-fs mutations showed lymph node metastases and recurrences, respectively, whereas none of the patients with fs mutations showed lymph node metastases and only one a recurrence. Therefore, for the evaluation of prognosis, we suggest applying not the p53 mutational status in general, but the specific type of mutation",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in bladder tumors from arylamine-exposed workers",
    "Abstract": "In this study we compared the frequency and pattern of p53 mutations in 34 bladder tumors from people with high-level occupational exposure to arylamines to those in 30 bladder tumors from people without such exposure. No differences were observed for p53 mutations between the two groups. The frequency of mutation was similar at 47% for arylamine- exposed individuals and 53% for unexposed individuals and showed a similar pattern of mutation, with GC to AT transitions accounting for the majority of the mutations in both groups. This finding suggests that arylamine exposure does not leave a mutational 'footprint' in the p53 gene. However, compared to other tumors, bladder tumors from both exposed and unexposed individuals had a high frequency of multiple mutations and it is interesting that these mutations were highly concordant. We suggest that one explanation of this pattern of mutations could be from decreased DNA repair fidelity within tumor cells. The frequency of mutation in p53 is closely linked to tumor grade and stage and so may be a late event in the development of bladder tumors",

    "Title": "Association of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17p with high platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptor expression in human malignant gliomas",
    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptor (PDGFR-alpha) expression in gliomas of various degrees of malignancy and to correlate the findings with genetic alterations present in the same tumor samples. We analyzed 83 tumors by in situ hybridization using a PDGFR-alpha cRNA probe. Increased PDGFR-alpha mRNA expression was observed in astrocytic tumors of all stages of malignancy, although the highest levels were found in glioblastoma multiforme. To evaluate the frequency of PDGFR-alpha gene amplification, differential PCR requiring less DNA than Southern analysis was used with fluorescence-labeled primers corresponding to the kinase insert region of the PDGFR-alpha. Only 7 of 43 glioblastomas and none of the other tumors tested showed amplification of the PDGFR- alpha gene, suggesting that a mechanism other than gene amplification is responsible for the overexpression of PDGFR-alpha in glial brain tumors. Comparison of the in situ hybridization data with genetic alterations in the same tumor material showed a significant correlation of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17p (Fisher's exact, P < 0.0002) with high expression levels of PDGFR-alpha. Because that was the case in both low- and high-grade astrocytomas, our data imply that PDGFR-alpha is actively involved in tumor cell proliferation in early and late stages of glioma development. The association of PDGFR-alpha expression with a distinct subset of glioblastomas characterized by loss of heterozygosity 17p further supports the differentiation of these tumors into molecular variants",

    "Title": "Adenovirus-mediated transfer of the p53 gene produces rapid and generalized death of human glioma cells via apoptosis",
    "Abstract": "Wild-type p53 is involved in several aspects of cell cycle control and suppression of transformation, inducing either apoptosis or G1 block in cell cycle progression. Using a recombinant adenovirus containing the wild-type p53 cDNA, the biological effects of the newly expressed wild- type p53 protein were examined in six human glioma cell lines. Three cell lines (U-251 MG, U-373 MG, and A-172) expressed endogenous mutant p53, and the other three (U-87 MG, EFC-2, and D54 MG) expressed wild- type p53. The restoration of normal p53-encoded protein in the mutant cell lines induced apoptosis as assessed by morphological studies using nuclear staining, electron microscopy, and flow cytometric assays. In wild-type p53 cell lines, however, the overexpression of wild-type p53 did not result in apoptosis but inhibited cellular proliferation rather drastically and modified the neoplastic phenotype. Differential effects suggest two pathways for glioma oncogenesis and a possible therapeutic strategy",

    "Title": "p53 mutations and clonality in vulvar carcinomas and squamous hyperplasias: evidence suggesting that squamous hyperplasias do not serve as direct precursors of human papillomavirus-negative vulvar carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Previous studies of vulvar carcinomas have shown two distinct subsets with respect to several clinicopathologic features. In younger women, the tumors are frequently human papillomavirus (HPV) positive, are usually of basaloid or warty histology, and are associated with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. In older women, the tumors are usually HPV negative, are typical keratinizing squamous carcinomas, and are associated with squamous hyperplasia--a lesion that has been purported to serve as a precursor to HPV-negative invasive carcinoma. In squamous carcinomas of the cervix, p53 inactivation (through gene mutation or interaction with the HPV E6 oncoprotein) occurs in most cases. Comparatively few studies have assessed p53 mutation and HPV status in vulvar carcinomas, and none has used molecular markers to evaluate squamous hyperplasias as direct precursors of HPV-negative invasive cancers. Of 18 invasive squamous carcinomas analyzed, seven (39%) were found to be HPV positive. Four p53 gene mutations were identified--all in HPV-negative tumors. DNA was subsequently prepared from microdissected archival tissues from all four specimens showing p53 gene mutations. DNA was separately isolated from normal squamous epithelium, invasive squamous carcinoma, and associated squamous hyperplasia. In each specimen, the p53 mutation was confirmed in the invasive tumor and absent in both normal and hyperplastic epithelium. To further investigate squamous hyperplasia as a potential precursor of HPV-negative invasive carcinoma, the authors determined the clonality of hyperplastic lesions adjacent to invasive carcinomas with p53 mutation. Clonality analyses were performed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay for X chromosome inactivation. Although all three informative carcinomas tested were monoclonal, corresponding normal epithelia and hyperplastic lesions were polyclonal. These findings underscore the heterogeneity of vulvar cancers with respect to loss of wild type p53 function either by interaction with the HPV E6 oncoprotein or somatic mutation of p53, and suggest that squamous hyperplasias do not serve as direct precursors of HPV-negative squamous carcinomas",

    "Title": "Mutations in the p53 gene in pulmonary blastomas: immunohistochemical and molecular studies [see comments]",
    "Abstract": "Well-differentiated fetal adenocarcinomas and biphasic blastomas are types of lung cancer that contain glands that mimic the appearance of fetal lung. Biphasic blastomas also show a primitive embryonic stroma. Despite histological similarities leading these two tumors to be classified as pulmonary blastomas, they have distinct clinical and prognostic features. Little information is available on genetic changes in these tumors because they are rare; therefore, the authors studied nine biphasic blastomas and 12 well-differentiated fetal adenocarcinomas for the presence of mutations in the p53 gene. Mutations in the p53 gene are common in other lung cancers, and the type of mutation in the p53 gene can provide information about the original or inciting mutagens. The authors found five biphasic blastomas (42%) had mutations in the p53 gene by immunohistochemical and molecular analysis, whereas none of the well-differentiated fetal adenocarcinomas contained mutations. These results provide molecular support for the significance of distinguishing between well- differentiated fetal adenocarcinoma and biphasic blastoma histologically and identify several types of p53 gene mutations that occur in these tumors",

    "Abstract": "The WAF1 (CIP1/SDI1) gene encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor which is induced by wild-type, but not mutated, p53 gene product. WAF1 immunohistochemistry has been suggested to clarify the phenotype of overexpressed p53 gene product. We evaluated both p53 and WAF1 gene products by immunohistochemistry in 98 esophagectomy specimens with Barrett esophagus and/or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction. Diffuse positive p53 staining was found in 40 of 88 adenocarcinomas (45%) and in dysplastic Barrett epithelium in 20 of 65 cases (31%), but not in Barrett mucosa without dysplasia (n = 36, P = .0004). Eighty-eight percent of cancers exhibited WAF1 expression, but there was no association with p53 and WAF1 staining. WAF1 protein was also identified in Barrett epithelium and in esophageal squamous and gastric epithelium. In contrast to carcinomas, a unique pattern of mutually exclusive p53 and WAF1 expression was found in five cases of dysplastic Barrett epithelium; a missense mutation at codon 175 of p53 was identified in one. p53 staining of adenocarcinoma was associated with shorter patient survival but was not independent of stage; WAF1 status added no prognostic information. Our findings show that WAF1 immunohistochemistry complements p53 immunohistochemistry in some cases of Barrett dysplasia but not in adenocarcinomas. Positive p53 immunostaining can serve to confirm a neoplastic process in Barrett mucosa. Positive staining of adenocarcinomas may be an indication of advanced stage",

    "Abstract": "A series of 107 lymph node-negative (LNN) breast cancers was stained immunohistochemically with a combination of p53 and c-erb B-2. The immunohistochemical results were semiquantitated using a previously described system by Allred et al. p53 immunopositive cases were further screened for DNA mutations by the polymerase chain reaction-single- strand conformation polymorphism method (PCR-SSCP). Three representative cases showing mobility shifts were directly sequenced. One hundred of 103 invasive carcinomas were of no special type (infiltrating ductal carcinomas not otherwise specified). The three special type carcinomas included a tubular carcinoma, a classic infiltrating lobular carcinoma, and a mucinous carcinoma. Twenty-six patients (25.2%) had grade I carcinomas, and 77 patients (75%) had grade 2 or 3 carcinomas. There were four cases composed predominantly of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with foci of microinvasion. Twenty- seven of 107 patients (25%) died of disease. All those who died had grade 2 or 3 tumors. Univariate analysis showed that p53 and c-erb B-2 positivity (score > 6) were associated with a decreased overall survival (OS) (P = .0012 and P = .010, respectively), and a decreased disease-free survival (DFS) (P = .0009 and P = .027, respectively). The multivariate model selected these two variables as the best predictors of both OS and DFS (all P = or < .01). These results suggest that semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis of p53 and c-erb B-2 provides prognostic information in LNN disease",

    "Title": "The role of p53 mutation and protein expression in primary and recurrent adenoid cystic carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a malignant tumor of salivary gland origin having a propensity for spread by direct extension or perineural invasion with frequent recurrences. Previous reports have shown that tumor behavior is not always predicted by histological pattern or stage. Little is known of the role of p53 tumor suppressor gene mutation and altered protein expression with respect to ACC pathobiology and recurrence. The authors analyzed a group of 14 ACC specimens (seven primary; seven recurrent) from 13 patients treated between 1987 to 1993. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens were reviewed and subjected to, immunohistochemistry (p53, DO-7, DAKO, Nutley, NJ; and WAF-I, Ab-1, Oncogene Sciences, Uniondale, NY) on 4- microm-thick histological sections as a prelude to p53 genotyping. In one case, sequential material representing primary and recurrent tumor was analyzed. Each tumor specimen was topographically genotyped for p53 point mutational change. Minute tissue samples were removed from unstained sections, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified for p53 exons 5 to 8, and then underwent direct DNA sequencing. Six of seven primary ACCs were p53 immunostain negative. Four of seven recurrent (57%) ACCs were p53 immunopositive. These tumors showed varying degrees of p53 immunopositivity ranging from diffuse, intense staining of most tumor cells (n = 1) to interspersed, strongly positive cells mixed with predominantly p53 immunonegative cells (n = 4). All tumors were WAF-I immunostain negative. Two of the most immunopositive recurrent tumors each manifested a single type of p53 point mutation detected by p53 DNA genotyping (p53 exon 5:codon 175 and p53 exon 6:codon 199). In the case in which both primary and recurrent tumor was available, only the recurrent tumor contained point mutational damage. Negative immunostaining for p53 in primary ACC suggests that p53 mutation is not important in early events involving development of this tumor. In contrast, the frequent presence of p53-positive cells and the detection of point mutations in recurrent ACC suggests that p53 alterations are involved in later stages of tumor progression, important in the phenomenon of ACC recurrence",

Exons 4 to 9 of the p53 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and directly sequenced. To determine allelic loss of p53, the region containing polymorphic codon 72 was amplified and digested with BstUI restriction nuclease. Overexpression of p53 protein was detected in paraffin section using mouse monoclonal antibody (PAb 1801). Point mutations of the p53 gene were detected in 7 (28%) of 25 solar keratoses and predominant in pyrimidines (86%). Loss of allele was found in 29% of informative samples. Seven (28%) cases showed immunopositivity; four cases had point mutation, but three cases did not. Two cases with point mutation were immunonegative. Characteristically point mutations, LOH and immunopositivity of p53 were seen predominantly as bowenoid and hypertrophic type lesion. These results suggest that sunlight can cause mutations of p53 gene and that p53 gene mutations may play an important role in skin carcinogenesis",

    "Abstract": "Recent molecular biological studies have shown evidence for a distinct pathogenesis of pilocytic astrocytomas based on alterations other than mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53. To prove these data, the authors screened a series of 42 astrocytic human brain tumors with a relatively high proportion (16.6%) of the pilocytic variant for the presence of p53 mutations, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, followed by DNA sequencing. Mutations were found in one of seven (14.3%) pilocytic astrocytomas, in one of 18 (5.6%) low grade astrocytomas, and in one of four (25%) anaplastic astrocytomas, but in none of 13 glioblastomas. Sites of missense mutations were in exon 8 (codons 281 and 282), and exon 5 (codon 151). Silent mutation was found in exon 9 (codon 324), which was related to pilocytic astrocytoma. This is, to the authors' knowledge, the first report that shows a p53 mutation in pilocytic astrocytomas. However, the p53 mutation was only found in one of seven tumors of this entity and was a silent mutation, which does not lead to change of amino acids. Thus, the significance of this alteration for the development of this special tumor type seems to be low. Nevertheless, it may be a sign of genetic instability and is thus suggested to be of certain pathogenetic relevance. The p53 findings concerning the other tumors are in accordance with the view of p53 gene mutations to be early events in astrocytoma formation",

The patient was a 14-year-old boy who exhibited hepatosplenomegaly while receiving chemotherapy for a mediastinal immature teratoma that had been resected 11 months before. The spleen and liver of the excisional biopsy displayed infiltration of multinucleated giant atypical cells with prominent erythrophagia in massive aggregations. These atypical cells expressed CD68, alpha1-antitrypsin, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, lysozyme, and vimentin, suggesting that the tumor cells may have been derived from macrophages. Immunocytochemistry showed p53 expression in the tumor cells of the malignant histiocytosis, as well as in the elements of the immature teratoma. Direct sequence analysis showed the p53 mutation in the tumor cells of the immature teratoma to be a mutation at codon 175 (exon 5), whereas the mutation in the malignant histiocytosis occurred at codon 285 (exon 8), ie, polyclonality was exhibited and these features suggested that the malignant histiocytosis arose independently from the immature teratoma during the chemotherapy",

    "Title": "p53, Ki-ras, and DNA ploidy in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Ki-ras mutations and DNA aneuploidy are common findings in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. An altered p53 tumor-suppressor gene has been suggested to cooperate with activated Ki-ras in malignant cellular transformation and could enhance genomic instability. We have investigated a panel of well-documented pancreatic carcinomas with defined ploidy and Ki-ras mutations for the presence and pattern of genetic alterations of the p53 gene, their coincidence with Ki-ras point mutations, and their correlation with DNA ploidy, tumor pathology, and clinical course. DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue and polymerase-chain-reaction- amplified fragments of the p53 gene exons 5 to 9 were screened by the single-strand conformation polymorphism method. The positive cases were further examined for mutations by direct sequencing. Twenty-nine of seventy-one (41%) tumors showed mutations of the p53 gene, however, five tumors carried two mutations resulting in a total of 34/71 (48%) genetic alterations of the p53 gene. The majority were missense point mutations and distributed primarily within the evolutionary conserved domains (62%). Ten of Thirty-four (29%) affected the hotspot codons 248, 273, and 282, respectively, and 21/34 (62%) of the p53 gene mutations clustered on exons 7 and 8. Transitions (71%) predominated over transversions (15%), deletions were identified in 7/34 (21%) tumors. One third of the carcinomas showed both Ki-ras codon 12 and p53 gene mutations. p53 mutations correlated with distant metastasis (p < 0.05) and survival (p < 0.05). DNA triploidy was associated with a mutated Ki-ras gene (p < 0.05) as well as with double mutations of c-Ki- ras and p53 (p < 0.05). Unlike most other malignant tumors pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas exhibit a significantly higher incidence of c-Ki- ras than p53 gene mutations. However, like other neoplasms p53 gene mutations seem to be associated with a metastatic phenotype possibly acquired during tumor progression",

    "Title": "Immunophenotype, mRNA expression, and gene structure of p53 in Wilms' tumors",
    "Abstract": "The anaplastic variant of Wilms' tumor is regarded as the result of tumor progression of the more common classic Wilms' tumor. Anaplasia is rare and occurs in only 4.5% of tumors. Three anaplastic Wilms' tumors in our collection were examined in comparison with 10 classic Wilms' tumors for p53 expression by immunohistochemical techniques and Northern blot analysis, and their p53 gene structure was determined by single-stranded conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. All classic tumors contained a wild-type p53 gene and expressed marginal levels of protein as expected for normal p53. In contrast, three out of three anaplastic tumors demonstrated evidence of p53 alterations consistent with a role of p53 in tumor progression. One of the anaplastic mutants (W4) did not express protein or p53 mRNA. Its apparently normal immunophenotype would have disguised the mutated nature of p53, which was detected only by mRNA and sequence analysis. The second anaplastic mutant (W16) contained normal levels of p53 mRNA, but overexpressed the protein in a fashion typical of mutated p53. The same immunophenotype was displayed by fixed primary tissue of the third anaplastic tumor (W17), but p53 mutation could not be confirmed for lack of frozen primary material. The present study emphasizes the importance of p53 function in the anaplastic progression of Wilms' tumor and the risk of error in assessing normal p53 function using a single methodology",

    "Title": "Molecular and immunohistochemical identification of p53 alterations in bone and soft tissue sarcomas",
    "Abstract": "p53 has been shown to suppress tumor growth by regulating the cell cycle and by triggering apoptosis. Acquired somatic mutations of the p53 gene have been observed in a variety of human malignancies, and these result in a loss of its tumor suppressor function. To examine the occurrence of p53 abnormalities in bone and soft tissue sarcomas, 113 tumors were subjected to molecular analysis and mutations were confirmed in 16 tumors. The frequency of p53 alterations varied among the different subtypes of bone and soft tissue sarcomas, being observed predominantly in osteosarcomas (8/34 cases), rhabdomyosarcomas (2/3 cases), Ewing's sarcomas (1/5 cases), and liposarcomas (3/21 cases). In contrast, p53 gene mutations were detected at a lower frequency in malignant fibrous histiocytomas (2/34 cases) and not at all in nine chondrosarcomas and five leiomyosarcomas. Immunohistochemical staining of p53 protein was performed on 69 cases and compared to the DNA results. For 64 cases the results were concordant: 56 sarcomas were considered to have wild-type p53 by both techniques. As well, increased p53 protein expression was observed in eight of the nine tumors with p53 gene mutations. However, positive p53 staining was also seen in four sarcomas which had no detectable p53 mutations in exons 5 through 9. Because some sarcomas exhibit amplification and overexpression of MDM-2, which may interact with p53 and cause stabilization of wild-type p53 protein, we examined these tumors for MDM-2 amplification. None of the tumors with MDM-2 amplification exhibited p53 immunopositivity. Very weak p53 reactivity was detected in four malignant fibrous histiocytomas that had received either chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Of 16 metastatic lesions examined, only one contained a p53 mutation. In addition, for five cases in which both the original lesion and its metastases were analyzed, p53 alterations were not observed in the metastases if the tumor was wild-type at presentation. These data suggest that p53 alterations occur at different frequencies in various subtypes of sarcoma and, although detected in metastatic lesions, are not associated more frequently with progression",

    "Abstract": "The relationship between the mutation of the p53 gene and the expression of the p53 protein and the Ki-67 antigen has been investigated in 115 cases with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, using the immunohistochemical double staining technique, single-strand conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing methods. Eighteen cases showed more than 10% of p53+ cells and the others showed a few p53+ cells presented sporadically. Alterations in the p53 gene were detected in six cases with B cell type, consisting of five cases with point mutation and one case with point mutation and 15 base pairs deletion. These six cases showed a high percentage of p53+ cells and five cases revealed that the percentage of p53+ cells was higher than that of Ki- 67+ cells (p53+ cells > Ki-67+ cells). Excluding the six cases with mutation of the p53 gene, all cases revealed that the percentage of p53+ cells was less than that of Ki-67+ cells (p53+ cells < Ki-67+ cells). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between expression of the p53 protein and of the Ki-67 antigen in histologic types of B cell lymphomas and of T cell lymphomas, respectively, except in small non-cleaved (Burkitt's) and lymphoblastic types. Therefore, sporadic cases showing p53+ cells > Ki-67+ cells revealed alteration of the p53 gene, and expressed abnormal p53 protein (mutant form). Most cases showing p53+ cells < Ki-67+ cells expressed normal p53 protein (wild type), and may reflect the rapid proliferation rate",

    "Title": "Immunohistochemical detection of p53 in Wilms' tumors correlates with unfavorable outcome",
    "Abstract": "The role of p53 in the pathogenesis and progression of Wilms' tumors is only partly understood. Although p53 mutations were initially reported only in anaplastic Wilms' tumors, we had reported that, of two of twenty-one cases that had a p53 mutation, one tumor showed no evidence of anaplasia. To determine the significance of p53 expression in all clinical stages of Wilms' tumor, twenty-eight cases were analyzed for p53 immunoreactivity. Paraffin sections were immunolabeled with two different monoclonal antibodies, recognizing both mutant and wild-type p53. Fifteen of sixteen tumors in the recurrent/metastatic group and three of twelve tumors in the nonmetastatic/nonrecurrent group showed p53 immunopositivity. Only one of three positive tumors in the latter group showed moderate to strong positivity, whereas twelve of sixteen metastatic/recurrent tumors revealed a similar degree of p53 positivity. The positivity was stronger in the metastasis/recurrences as compared with the corresponding primary tumor. Western blot analysis revealed p53 expression in all of the Wilms' tumors tested, suggesting its involvement in the development of Wilms' tumors. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis performed on twenty-three of these tumors revealed p53 mutations in four of fourteen recurrent/metastatic tumors and none in the nonmetastatic/nonrecurrent group. Our results show that, whereas 60% of cases were immunopositive for p53 protein, mutations were detected in only 16% of tumors, indicating that wild- type p53 protein is retained in the other tumors. We conclude that p53 immunopositivity strongly correlates with recurrence/metastasis in Wilms' tumors. Furthermore, the accumulation of p53 in these tumors is not only due to mutations but may also involve stabilization of normal p53 with other proteins",

    "Title": "Replication error phenotype and p53 gene mutation in lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue",
    "Abstract": "Low grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas commonly arise from a background of chronic inflammatory lesions and can transform into high grade tumors at a late stage. Because chronic inflammation is closely associated with genetic instability, which is one of the mechanisms leading to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, it is possible that genetic instability plays an important role in MALT lymphomagenesis. In this study, we have examined the frequency of replication error (RER+) phenotype, a newly defined manifestation of genetic instability, and its relationship to p53 mutations in 40 MALT lymphomas (16 high grade and 24 low grade). RER+ phenotype was detected in 21/40 (52.5%) MALT lymphomas (12/24, 50% in low grade; 9/16, 56.2% in high grade). Five of seven reactive lymphoid infiltrates adjacent to tumors also showed one microsatellite alteration, four of which were identified in the corresponding lymphoma lesions in the same patient. In five RER+ high grade lymphomas with low grade lesions, homogeneous and heterogeneous microsatellite alterations were observed between the two components. The same 40 cases were investigated for p53 gene mutations at exons 5 to 8 by PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing. p53 point mutations were found in 11 (27.5%) of the 40 cases. These mutations were statistically related to RER+ phenotype (P < 0.05). Our results demonstrate that the RER+ phenotype is a common genetic feature of MALT lymphomas. Genetic instability occurs throughout the spectrum of the lymphoma development and may be related to the accumulation of genetic aberrations such as p53 mutations. The observation of identical microsatellite alterations between the adjacent lymphoid infiltrates and their corresponding lymphomas provides genetic evidence for evolutionary link of the two lesions. The homogeneous and heterogeneous microsatellite alterations observed between low and high grade components indicate their clonal lineage and genetic diversity.",

    "Abstract": "Thirty-one tumor samples from selected cases of gastric carcinoma were analyzed for mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Template DNA was prepared according to the touch preparation procedure, which allowed us to isolate clusters of neoplastic cells out of a stromal cellular background to be used as a template in the amplification of target exons of the p53 locus. In our present study, by polymerase chain reaction/single strand conformation polymorphism analysis we give evidence of p53 mutations occurring in the DNA-binding core domain of the protein (exons 5 through 9), which are clustered in stages III and IV of the disease (six mutations out of seventeen samples; 35%). No p53 mutations were detected in fourteen gastric cancer samples at I and II stages. Beside the use of conventional molecular scanning procedures, our study proposes the application of the touch preparation method to increase the detection of genetic alterations in human solid tumors",

    "Abstract": "Soft tissue sarcomas represent a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal malignancies, and the majority of the previous scientific studies that have analyzed the occurrence of cell cycle regulators aberrations within soft tissue sarcomas have dealt with broad categories of different tumors. As a consequence, data concerning single classes of sarcomas are very limited. The authors analyze herein a histologically homogeneous series of 23 cases of leiomyosarcoma of the deep soft tissue. The p53 pathway was studied by investigating the p53 gene and protein, MDM2 protein, and p21waf1 protein. The Rb-cyclin D pathway was analyzed by studying the Rb gene and protein, p16MTS1/INK4A gene and protein, cyclin D1Prad1/bcl1 and cyclin D3 proteins. Aberrations of the p53 pathway were observed in about 16 percent of cases and were limited to the p53 gene. Such a finding contrasts with the higher rates of p53/MDM2 abnormalities reported in other types of sarcomas such as liposarcoma. Interestingly, abnormalities involving the Rb-cyclin D pathway were detected in about 90 percent of cases. The Rb-cyclin D pathway therefore emerges as the preferred target for molecular abnormalities in this subset of soft tissue sarcomas",

    "Abstract": "Chromosome 17 and p53 gene locus alterations were determined on 67 gastric carcinomas by dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, using probes for centromere 17 and the 17p13.1 (p53 locus). The results were compared with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 17p13.3, direct sequencing of exons 5 to 9 of p53, and nuclear overexpression of p53 protein. Deletion of p53 was found in 26 of 67 tumors (39%). All 26 also showed LOH at 17p13.3, frequently overexpressed p53 protein, and had polysomy 17. The functional loss of p53 gene in these tumors, 85% of which were of intestinal type, appears to be caused by both deletion of 17p13.1 and missense mutation of the remaining allele. There were 9 tumors that had neither deletion nor LOH but had a large proportion of cancer cells that overexpressed p53 election. Despite evidence of LOH, there was no p53 deletion in 11 tumors. Finally, 21 tumors, mostly of diffuse type, showed neither deletions, LOH, nor p53 overexpression. Our data suggest that in gastric cancer, deletion of 17p is principally responsible for the allelic loss at the p53 gene and that analysis of deletions by the dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization is a sensitive and useful approach to clarify chromosomal aberrations",

    "Title": "The p53 signal transduction pathway is intact in human neuroblastoma despite cytoplasmic localization",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are rarely found in neuroblastoma. Though typically a nuclear protein, a number of tumor cell types have recently been reported to exhibit cytoplasmic p53 immunostaining, and it has been suggested that altered cellular localization is another mechanism of inhibiting p53 function. We examined p53 protein expression, localization, and function in neuroblastoma cell lines with wild-type p53 genes. Basal p53 levels were largely confined to the cytoplasmic compartment in these cells. However, after irradiation, p53 protein levels increased predominately in the nucleus. Transcriptional activity of p53 was intact in these cells because 'downstream' proteins, p21WAF1 and MDM2, were induced by irradiation. In contrast to a neuroblastoma cell line harboring a mutant p53 gene, the neuroblastoma cells with wild-type protein were associated with an intact G1 arrest after DNA damage. The induced nuclear protein in these neuroblastoma cells also appeared functional as measured by its capacity to bind to a DNA oligomer containing a p53-consensus sequence. We have concluded that although p53 expression in neuroblastoma cells is primarily localized to the cytosol, ionizing radiation induces a functional p53 protein in the nucleus and that this cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 in human neuroblastoma is not a mechanism of inactivating p53 function",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this investigation was to examine the possibility of analysing TP53 mutations in archival paraffin-embedded material with the constant denaturant gel electrohoresis (CDGE) method. We extracted DNA from 193 archival primary breast carcinoma samples, diagnosed in 1981-83; further analysis was possible for 186 of these.  TP53 mutations in exons 5-8 were detected with CDGE in 30 samples (16.1%) and 17 of these mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated TP53 nuclear accumulation in 58 tumours (31%). A strong association between the presence of TP53 mutations and TP53 immunostaining was observed (P < 0.001). Our mutation and immunohistochemistry results are in agreement with other findings based on fresh tumour tissue.  TP53 abnormalities were significantly related to high S-phase fraction, low oestrogen receptors (ER content and high tumour grade. Survival of patients with TP53 abnormalities, in the group as a whole, did not differ from patients with normal TP53. Our study did, however, show that patients with abnormal TP53 patients had a significantly shorter post-recurrence survival (P = 0.005) than patients with normal TP53.",

    "Title": "High frequency of p53 gene mutations in primary breast cancers in Japanese women, a low-incidence population",
    "Abstract": "The pattern of acquired mutations in the p53 tumour-suppressor gene is potentially useful for determining factors contributing to carcinogenesis in diverse populations differing in incidence and/or mortality from the disease. We previously reported differences in mutational patterns of the p53 gene in primary breast cancers from Midwest US Caucasian, African-American and Austrian women. Herein, we report 16 mutations in 27 primary breast cancers from Japanese women from Hirosaki, a population with a low incidence of breast cancer. The frequency of 59.3% of p53 mutations is the highest reported in breast cancers from a particular ethnic group thus far. A relatively high number of mutations (7/16) were heterozygous in at least some tumour cell clusters. Intergroup comparisons of the mutational pattern between this population and several other US, European and Japanese populations do not show any statistically significant differences. There were recurrent mutations at two sites, codon 273 (R --> H; three mutations), a common hotspot of mutations in breast and other cancers, and codon 183 (S --> Stop; two mutations), a very rare location for p53 mutations. These mutations were shown to be independent and presumably not in the germ line. The highest frequency of p53 mutations raises the possibility that p53 mutagenesis is a predominant factor for breast cancer development in this low-risk Japanese group, whereas in other cohorts different mechanisms are likely to account for the higher proportion of breast cancer. Further studies are needed to confirm the present observations",

The majority of the patients with the 14 bp deletion were women (13/17), and it seemed as though certain potential risk factors for carcinoma of the head and neck were less common in this group",

    "Abstract": "A common characteristic of cancer cells is unrestrained cell division. This may be caused by mutational changes in genes coding for components of cell cycle-controlling networks. Alterations in genes involved in G1 checkpoint control have been registered in many human tumours, and investigations from several laboratories show that such alterations, taken together, are the most frequent changes detected in cancer cells. The present paper describes mutational analysis by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) and nucleotide sequence analysis of the genes coding for the p15, p53 and N- ras proteins in 26 metastases from 25 melanoma patients. The registered mutation frequencies add together with previously registered mutations in p16 in the same patient samples to a substantial total frequency of 44% of patients with mutation in at least one of the investigated genes. These results show the occurrence of heterogeneous defects among components of the cell cycle controlling machinery in a human melanoma tumour sample collection and demonstrate that the total frequency of detected alterations increases with the number of cell cycle controlling genes included in the screening panel",

    "Title": "Clinical and pathological associations with p53 tumour-suppressor gene mutations and expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 in colorectal carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Inactivation of the p53 tumour-suppressor gene is common in a wide variety of human neoplasms. In the majority of cases, single point mutations in the protein-encoding sequence of p53 lead to positive immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the p53 protein, and are accompanied by loss of the wild-type allele. Recently, the WAF1/Cip1 gene was identified as one of the genes induced by wild-type p53, and increased expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 has been found to reflect the status of the p53 tumour-suppressor pathway. We investigated the inactivation of p53 in a relatively small, but well-characterised, group of 46 colorectal carcinomas that were previously studied for allelic alterations, ras oncogene mutations and DNA aneuploidy. Alterations in p53 were identified by IHC, loss of 17p and DNA sequence analysis of exons 5-8, whereas p21WAF1/Cip1 protein expression was determined by IHC. p53 mutations were identified in 19 of the 46 tumours (41%), whereas positive IHC for p53 was found in 21 of the 46 tumours (46%). Positive IHC for p21WAF1/Cip1 was detected in 16 of 42 cases (38%). We found no relationship between p21WAF1/Cip1 staining and p53 protein expression or p53 mutational status. Inactivating mutations in the p53 gene correlated with LOH at 17p but not with LOH at 5q or 18q, Dukes' stage, tumour grade or DNA ploidy. There was a higher survival rate independent of Dukes' stage in the group with no alterations in p53 compared with those with evidence of dysfunction of p53, but the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that inactivation of p53 and altered expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 are common in colorectal carcinoma but do not correlate with each other or with the clinical or pathological parameters investigated",

Analysis by the last two techniques was restricted to exons 5-8. Initially, 110 breast tumours were screened for p53 expression by FCM. Seventy (64%) of tumours were immunopositive. Fifteen highly immunopositive and 15 completely immunonegative tumours were selected for further analysis by PCR-SSCP and genomic sequencing. Eleven out of 15 immunopositive tumours were found to have mutation by PCR-SSCP. Genomic sequencing confirmed the presence of mutation in 10 of these 11 immunopositive tumours. Therefore, four immunopositive tumours failed to show mutation by SSCP and five by genomic sequencing. Of the 15 immunonegative tumours, one showed mutation by both PCR-SSCP and genomic sequencing and one tumour has undergone deletion of the p53 gene. Overall, immunoreactivity correlated with both PCR-SSCP and genomic sequencing in 80% of cases (24/30), and there was 96.5% (28/29) concordance between PCR-SSCP and genomic sequencing. We conclude that there is good concordance between mutations detected by PCR-SSCP and genomic sequencing, but immunochemical detection of p53 overexpression is not an absolute indicator of p53 gene mutation",

In the present study we analysed the mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene in 25 primary and 20 metastatic human prostate cancer specimens.

In the present study, we used a novel hot-start PCR-SSCP technique using DNA Taq polymerase antibody, which eliminates primer-dimers and non-specific products. Because of this new technique, the results of PCR-SSCP showed very high resolution. Polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced directly for point mutations for the p53 gene. Mutations were found in 2 out of 25 primary prostate cancers (8%) and 4 out of 20 metastatic cancers (20%). Mutations were observed exclusively in exon 7 and not in exons 4, 5, 6, 8 or 9.

    "Abstract": "The importance of polymorphism in the glutathione S-transferase GSTM1, GSTT1 and, cytochrome P450, CYP2D6 loci in the pathogenesis of epithelial ovarian cancer has been assessed in two studies; firstly, a case-control study designed to determine the influence of these genes on susceptibility to this cancer, and secondly, the putative role of these genes in the protection of host cell DNA has been studied by comparing p53 expression in patients with different GSTM1, GSTT1 and CYP2D6 genotypes. The frequencies of GSTM1, GSTT1 and CYP2D6 genotypes in 84 cases and 325 controls were not different. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect p53 expression in 63 of these tumours. Expression was found in 23 tumours. Of the patients demonstrating immunopositivity, 20 (87%) were GSTM1 null. The frequency distributions of GSTM1 genotypes in p53-positive and -negative samples were significantly different (P = 0.002) and those for GSTT1 genotypes approached significance (exact P = 0.057). The proportion of patients with both GSTM1 null and GSTT1 null was also significantly greater in the immunopositive (4/22) than in the immunonegative group (1/40) (P = 0.0493). Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was used to detect mutations in the 23 tumour samples demonstrating p53 positivity. A shift in electrophoretic mobility of amplified fragments was found in 11 patients (exons 5, 6, 7 and 8) and these exons were sequenced. In eight samples a mutation was found. No SCCP variants were identified in the other 12 immunopositive patients. Sequencing of exons 4-9 of p53 from these tumours resulted in the detection of mutations in two patients (exons 5 and 7). Thus, in 23 patients who demonstrated immunopositivity, p53 mutations were found in nine patients with GSTM1 null (90.0%). In the 13 patients in whom no mutations were identified, 11 were GSTM1 null (84.6%). The data show that overexpression of p53 is associated with the GSTM1 null genotype. We propose the data are compatible with the view that GSTM1 and GSTT1 are critical in the detoxification of the products of oxidative stress produced during the repair of the ovarian epithelium. Thus, failure to detoxify products of this stress may result in damage to various genes in the host cell, including to p53, resulting in persistent expression of mutant protein. In other patients, oxidative stress effects damage to various genes, but not including p53, resulting in overexpression of wild-type p53",

    "Title": "Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 5q in ovarian cancer is frequently accompanied by TP53 mutation and identifies a tumour suppressor gene locus at 5q13.1-21",
    "Abstract": "Forty-nine ovarian tumours were examined for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 5 using eight microsatellite markers spanning both arms, including one at the APC locus. LOH on 5q was a frequent event, detectable in 23 of 49 (47%) tumours, whereas 5p LOH was detected in only 1 of 22 tumours (5%). Six tumours showed partial LOH on 5q, enabling the candidate region to be localised to a 22 cM region proximal to APC, flanked by D5S424 and D5S644. An association was found between 5q LOH and TP53 mutation, with 18 of 23 (78%) tumours with LOH on 5q also harbouring a TP53 mutation. LOH on 5q was observed in 6 of 18 (33%) stage I tumours, suggesting that it may be an early event in the molecular pathogenesis of certain ovarian carcinomas",

Areas of DCIS, with or without adjacent invasive or benign cells, have been separately microdissected from paraffin-embedded sections and analysed by PCR for genetic changes to chromosome 17p13. TP53 mutations and AI on 17p have been identified in cases of 'pure' DCIS as well as those with associated invasive carcinoma and, furthermore, have been identified in well-differentiated lesions as well as poorly differentiated ones",

    "Title": "Low frequency of p53 gene mutation and protein expression in mucinous colorectal carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Immunohistochemical data indicate that the frequency of p53 protein overexpression is consistently lower in the mucinous than in the non- mucinous carcinomas of the breast, ovary, pancreas and colon. This peculiar immunohistochemical behavior of the mucinous phenotype could be due to the effect of large amounts of mucus on the staining or to an actual mutation frequency difference between mucinous and non-mucinous carcinomas. This question was investigated on a group of mucinous colorectal carcinomas. DNA was extracted from paraffin sections of 16 human mucinous colorectal carcinomas and the mutation frequency was determined by sequencing of p53 exons amplified in PCR. The expression of p53 protein was determined with the avidin-biotin complex-peroxidase staining procedure and CM-1 antiserum. Twenty-five percent of the tumors, exhibited p53 protein overexpression and in 31% a mutation was detected. Concordance between the two techniques was found in 69% of tumors. Overexpression without mutation was observed in 12% and mutation without overexpression in 19%. G:C --> A:T transitions represented the most frequent lesion (80%), as previously observed in non-mucinous colorectal carcinomas. These data indicate that the mutation pattern in the p53 gene is similar in mucinous and non- mucinous colorectal carcinomas. The low frequency of p53 overexpression in the mucinous phenotype is not due to a mucus effect on the staining but is related to the low mutation frequency of p53 gene. These results lead to the hypothesis that in contrast to the nonmucinous tumors the development of the majority of colonic carcinomas with the mucinous phenotype may be independent from p53 mutations",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutation in cerebral primitive neuroectodermal tumor in Taiwan",
    "Abstract": "p53 mutation has been rarely reported in cerebral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET). To determine the significance of p53 mutations in the development of cerebral PNET, we studied cerebral PNET samples from 14 patients, 8 females and 6 males with a mean age of 38 years (range 10 months to 77 years) who had total or subtotal surgical resection. Histological typing of PNET with neuronal (N) and non- neuronal (NN) differentiation groups revealed 8 and 6 cases, respectively. Six (43%) of the 14 patients had p53 mutation. The p53(+) and p53(-) groups had an age range of 19-77 with a mean of 49 years and 10 months to 57 years with a mean of 30 years, respectively. p53 expression between the PNET-N and PNET-NN groups was 5 of 8 (62.5%) and 1 of 6 (16.7%), respectively. The mutations contained 3 transitions, 2 transversions and 1 frameshift; none of them occurred at the site of 'hot-spot' residues (codons 175, 248, 273). The results suggest that: (1) p53 mutation in cerebral PNET tends to show a higher incidence of neuronal differentiation and occurs in the older age group in Taiwan, (2) there was no difference in survival time between the PNET-N and PNET-NN groups (7 months and 6 months) (P = 0.54), and between p53(+) and p53(-) groups (6 months and 7 months) (P = 0.57), and (3) PNET may be an entity of a heterogenous group of tumors with different genetic mechanisms controlling their trends of differential lineage. Further studies are needed to determine the significance of p53 mutations in PNET development, especially the role of carcinogens in the genesis of PNET in Taiwan",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutation in thyroid carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "The pattern of p53 protein expression was examined in 92 cases of thyroid carcinoma. When the cases were divided into two groups with regard to their cytoplasmic staining only or nucleus staining only, the frequency of the nucleus staining group was significantly higher in the poorly differentiated carcinoma (PDC) and undifferentiated carcinoma (UDC) groups (10.5% and 25%) compared with the other groups of histologic subtype (0%). The results suggest positivity in nucleus staining for p53 may be a marker for the biologically worse carcinomas, PDC and UDC, however, tumors showing only cytoplasmic staining of p53 favor a fair prognosis. In this paper, we also elucidate the spectrum of genotypic aberrations of p53 in each histological subtype. Of 92 thyroid tumor samples analyzed, the overall frequency of p53 mutation was 8.5%. The mutations occurred in 4.35% (2/46) ot WDC, 17.2% (5/29) of PDC, and 16.7% (1/6) of oncocytic carcinoma. Two of five PDC cases and one papillary carcinoma revealed point mutations in exon 8 as follows; GTG (val) to CTG (leu) at codon 272 in case 23T, CGA (arg) to CCA (pro) at codon 306 in case of 30T, and CGG (arg) to AGG (arg) at codon 282 in case 28T. All of the p53 mutations detected were represented by single nucleotide changes including two missense and one silent mutation. In contrast to the missense mutations found in PDC, it is interesting to note that the silent mutation was checked in 28T of well differentiated papillary carcinoma. These results represents molecular evidence that p53 gene aberration associated with overexpression of the mutant form of p53 protein plays a crucial role in the biologically aggressive subtypes of thyroid carcinoma, and point mutation only was not sufficient to be a prognostic marker for the biologically aggressive malignancy of thyroid tumors. There was no p53 gene aberration found in four cases of undifferentiated carcinoma (UDC) studied. The results suggest that other unknown factors should be responsible for the aggressiveness in some UDC of thyroid carcinoma except overexpression of p53",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in gastric cancers from Taiwan",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 gene were investigated in 80 surgical specimens of primary gastric cancer by polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. Mutations were detected in 18 tumors (22.5%) and localized to exons 5, 7 and 8. Mutations did not follow a random distribution among different subtypes, but instead clustered in the group of papillary adenocarcinomas, in which 7/12 (58.3%) cases were mutated. Positivity for p53 mutation was significantly higher in intestinal-type (37.5%) than in diffuse-type carcinomas (12.5%). These results suggest that gene alterations of p53 are not rare and may participate in the carcinogenesis of intestinal- type carcinomas of the stomach. Twenty of 21 p53 mutations were represented by single nucleotide changes, mostly missense mutations (19 events) and one nonsense mutation. Transversional mutations constitute the majority of p53 mutations (65%) and only 20% of mutations show G:C to A:T transitions. It is possible that the etiologies of gastric cancer in different geographical areas are different",

    "Title": "p53 functional loss in a colon cancer cell line with two missense mutations (218leu and 248trp) on separate alleles",
    "Abstract": "We have sequenced p53 in three colon cancer cell lines capable of autonomous proliferation. SNU-C1 and SNU-C4 cells, whose autonomous growth is dependent upon autocrine stimulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), had wildtype p53 sequence of exons 4-9. In contrast, an EGFR ligand-independent cell line, SNU-C5, had heterozygous missense mutations affecting codons 218 (valine to leucine) and 248 (arginine to tryptophan) of p53. Bacterial cloning of p53 from SNU-C5 cells showed that the 248trp and 218leu mutants were both expressed and on separate alleles. 248trp is a common 'hot spot' mutant of p53 with variable dominant negative activity depending on the celullar context. Valine 218, in contrast, is rarely affected by mutation in cancers and is located in a region of the hydrophobic core domain away from 'hot spot' DNA contact sights. However, valine 218 is completely conserved across species, prompting us to investigate the function of 218leu in SNU-C5 cells. SNU-C5 cells exhibited complete loss of normal p53 function as evidenced by over-expression of p53 protein and by failure to show induction of p53, waf-1, mdm-2 or G1/S arrest in response to the DNA damaging agent, bleomycin. In a yeast p53 functional assay (FASAY), 50% of the clones were unable to transactivate a p53-specific promoter required for yeast colony expansion at 25, 30 or 37 degrees C. Sequencing of the p53 insert from several randomly selected wild-type and mutant yeast clones revealed that 218leu-bearing clones retained their ability to transactivate the p53-specific promoter. As expected, the 248trp-bearing clones lost this function. These data indicate that although 218leu retains normal transactivation activity on a p53 promoter in yeast at physiological temperatures, it is not capable of normal p53 function in the presence of a 248trp allele in SNU-C5 cells. It remains unclear whether the strong dominant negative activity of 248trp in SNU-C5 cells is related to the cellular context or to an unresolved abnormality of 218leu function",

Furthermore, there were young patients of 50 years and downward in their families. Therefore, it is possible that inherited disorders in mismatch repair systems contribute to high susceptibility to gastric cancers in these families",

    "Title": "p53 mutations associated with increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation in human head and neck cancer cell lines",
    "Abstract": "The p53 tumour suppressor gene is activated following cellular exposure to DNA-damaging agents. The functions of wild-type p53 protein include transient blocking of cell cycle progression, direct or indirect stimulation of DNA repair machinery and triggering of apoptosis if DNA repair fails. Therefore, the status of p53 protein may be critically associated with tumour cell radiosensitivity. In the present study we examine the intrinsic radiosensitivity of 20 human carcinoma cell lines derived from 15 patients with different types of head and neck tumour. Radiosensitivities were measured in a 96-well plate clonogenic assay in terms of the mean inactivation dose, surviving fraction at 2 Gy, and constants alpha and beta in the linear quadratic survival curve. The p53 allele status was determined by amplifying exons 4-10 by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), screening for mutations using single- strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and determining the exact type and location of a mutation by direct sequencing. The results showed that prevalence of p53 mutations in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines is high (80%), and that deletion of one or both wild- type alleles is common (75%). Intrinsic radiosensitivity of the cell lines varied greatly in terms of mean inactivation dose, from 1.4 +/- 0.1 to 2.6 +/- 0.2 Gy. Radiosensitivity correlated well with the p53 allele status so that cell lines carrying a wild-type p53 allele were significantly (P < 0.01) more radioresistant (mean inactivation dose 2.23 +/- 0.15 Gy) than cell lines which lacked a wild-type gene (1.82 +/- 0.24 Gy). Evaluation of our own results and those published in the literature lead us to conclude that absence of the wild-type p53 allele in human head and neck cancer cell lines is associated with increased radiosensitivity. However, the sensitivity is also strongly dependent on the exact type and location of the p53 mutation",

    "Abstract": "To investigate genetic abnormalities in human non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) associated with pulmonary asbestosis as compared with nou-asbestos linked lung cancers, twenty-nine primary non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) were examined for genetic abnormalities of p16/CDKN2, p53 and ras genes by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction products (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing. Ten specimens were obtained from autopsies in which concurrent pulmonary asbestosis was present, while 19 samples were surgical specimens from asbestosis-free patients. K-ras mutations were detected in 10% each of the cancers from both asbestosis and non-asbestosis cases. p16/CDKN2 deletions or mutations and p53 aberrations were demonstrated in 20% and 10% of tumors from asbestosis cases, whereas, 32% and 21% of the cancers, respectively, from asbestosis-free patients were positive. In conclusion, it is suggested that the enhancement of neoplasia in the lung by asbestos is not dependent on suppression of p16/CDKN2 and p53 or ras activation and therefore, that asbestosis may activate alternate tumorigenic pathways in the development of NSCLC.",

    "Abstract": "We analyzed 29 pairs of primary and metastatic lung carcinomas obtained at autopsy for mutations in the p53 gene, using the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism method (PCR-SSCP). We examined the relationship between p53 gene mutations and the development of metastasis, and the stability of p53 gene mutations during chemotherapy. The tumors consisted of six small cell carcinomas, 13 adenocarcinomas, eight squamous cell carcinomas, one large cell carcinoma, and one adeno-squamous cell carcinoma. PCR-SSCP analysis showed that three small cell carcinomas (50%), three adenocarcinomas (23%), two squamous cell carcinomas (25%), and one large cell carcinoma (100%) had p53 gene mutations. All these abnormalities were found between exon five and exon eight. The mutations in the primary tumors and the metastatic tumors were identical. These results suggest that p53 gene mutations occur before distant metastases develop, and that they may be stable during the process of metastasis. There were nine metastatic tumor samples that existed before the patients received chemotherapy. These samples showed identical p53 mutations as the corresponding primary tumor. This suggests that anticancer drugs rarely induce p53 gene mutations",

    "Title": "Overexpression of the EGF receptor and p53 mutations are mutually exclusive in the evolution of primary and secondary glioblastomas",
    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme, the most malignant human brain tumor, may develop de novo (primary glioblastoma) or through progression from low- grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma). We present further evidence that primary and secondary glioblastomas constitute distinct disease entities which develop through the acquisition of different genetic alterations. We analyzed p53 mutations, p53 protein accumulation and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression in 49 biopsies classified as primary or secondary glioblastoma according to clinical and histopathologic criteria. Patients with primary glioblastoma were selected on the basis of a clinical history of less than 3 months and histopathologic features of glioblastoma at the first biopsy (19 cases; mean age, 55 years). The diagnosis of secondary glioblastomas required at least two biopsies and clinical as well as histologic evidence of progression from low grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (30 cases; mean age, 39 years). DNA sequence analysis showed that p53 mutations were rare in primary glioblastomas (11%) while secondary glioblastomas had a high incidence of p53 mutations (67%), of which 90% were already present in the first biopsy. The incidence of p53 protein accumulation (nuclear immunoreactivity to PAb 1801) was also lower in primary (37%) than in secondary glioblastomas (97%). In contrast, immunoreactivity for the EGF receptor prevailed in primary glioblastomas (63%) but was rare in secondary glioblastomas (10%). Only one out of 49 glioblastomas showed EGFR overexpression and a p53 mutation. These data indicate that overexpression of the EGF receptor and mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are mutually exclusive events defining two different genetic pathways in the evolution of glioblastoma as the common phenotypic endpoint",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of the TP53 tumour suppressor gene have been reported for many human cancers. A variety of TP53 mutations have also been reported for both primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and associated metastases. To assess the pathogenetic significance of TP53 gene alterations in NSCLC, 24 paired samples of primary NSCLC and the corresponding normal lung tissue were analysed for mutations of the TP53 gene (exons 5-8) using exon-specific PCR, single-strand conformation polymorphism PCR (SSCP-PCR) and direct DNA sequencing; for p53 protein accumulation by immunohistochemistry and for 17p allelic loss using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) probes on Southern blots and amplified fragment length polymorphism-PCR. TP53 point mutations were observed in 9/24 (38%) tumours encompassing a total of 14 mutations. Two tumours displayed the same double mutation while a third harboured four different mutations. Seventeen of 24 NSCLCs (71%) overexpressed p53 protein and all 17 immunopositive tumours (100%) showed a mutation and/or allelic loss at the D17S30 locus. Of the 17 NSCLCs informative at the DS17S30 locus, 10 (59%) showed allelic loss, of which five (50%) were also mutated on the remaining TP53 allele. These results suggest that TP53 gene alterations are involved in the pathogenesis of primary NSCLC and that such alterations may serve a selective role in the development of NSCLC by diminishing the apoptotic potential of bronchial epithelial cells heterozygous for a TP53 point mutation. This may also explain the accumulation of multiple TP53 point mutations in 3/24 of our NSCLC samples",

In parallel, p53 protein accumulation was determined by means of immunohistochemistry. The percentage of mutations was found to be higher than previously reported (6 of 44 grade II oligodendrogliomas, 4 of 19 grade III oligodendrogliomas, 4 of 15 glioblastomas). In 4 cases, the mutations lead to distinct changes in the primary or secondary structure of the protein (cysteine-->tyrosine, proline-->leucine) and were associated with marked accumulation of p53 protein. A significant correlation between p53 protein accumulation and TP53 gene aberrations was found (P < 0.001), although p53 protein accumulation was detected more often than TP53 gene anomalies, indicating that factors other than TP53 gene mutation may also lead to a p53 protein accumulation in the tumour cells. A significant correlation was found for p53 protein accumulation and tumour grade but not TP53 gene mutations. In conclusion, evaluation of p53 protein accumulation reflected the clinical course of oligodendrogliomas better than the mere presence of TP53 gene mutations",

    "Abstract": "HPV infections have been previously observed in oral cancers, and inactivation of the p53 gene has been shown to be one of the most common genetic alterations in human tumors. We examined 179 oral specimens from 70 individuals with histologic findings of either normal mucosa (n = 6) or oral disease that ranged from mild dysplasia to invasive squamous-cell carcinoma (n = 64) to determine the occurrence of both HPV infection and p53 mutations and their relationship with several clinical factors. HPV infection was detected by PCR amplification of viral DNA, and the presence of p53 mutations was assayed using the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)-PCR technique. HPV infection was found in 31% of individuals with oral disease and was not seen in healthy individuals. Mutations in exons 5, 6, 7 or 8 of the p53 gene were detected in 37.5% of patients with oral lesions and in a biopsy from 1 healthy individual who was a heavy smoker. Approximately one-third of lesions classified as pre-malignant (dysplasia and carcinoma in situ) and 42% of invasive carcinomas contained p53 mutations. The majority of these mutations were G:T transversions located within exons 7 and 8. Tumor tissues from 6 patients with oral lesions were found both to be HPV-16-positive and to contain p53 mutations; of these, 4 were poorly differentiated carcinomas that were diagnosed as late-stage disease. In this study, p53 mutations were detected in the early stages of cancer development",

    "Title": "Characterization of p53 gene mutations in basal-cell carcinomas: comparison between sun-exposed and less-exposed skin areas",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 gene in 32 basal-cell carcinomas (BCC) developed in Japanese patients were identified by the polymerase chain reaction and single-strand-conformation polymorphism analysis, followed by sequencing the DNA. Among 16 BCC developed in continuously sun-exposed areas, 6 tumors showed 7 base substitutions, most of which were G:C to A:T transitions, mainly at the dipyrimidine sites. Seven out of 16 BCC developed in less-exposed areas showed 8 base substitutions, but the majority (75.0%) of them were transversions. These results suggest that the mutation in the p53 gene plays a significant role in the tumorigenesis of BCC developed in less-exposed areas as well as those in sun-exposed areas in Japanese patients. There must be therefore causative factors other than UV irradiation for BCC in less-exposed areas",

    "Title": "Reduced messenger RNA expression level of p21 CIP1 in human colorectal carcinoma tissues and its association with p53 gene mutation",
    "Abstract": "p21 Cip1 was first isolated as one of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) interacting proteins induced by wild-type p53 gene product, and it appears to play an essential regulatory role in the control of cell proliferation as a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of cyclin-Cdk complex that blocks the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. We have now examined the p21 Cip1 mRNA expression levels in 16 surgically excised human colorectal tumor and non-tumor tissues by Northern-blot analysis with reference to the identification of p53 gene mutations. p53 gene mutations were detected in 6 tumor tissues but not in the other 10 tissues by the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method and following direct sequencing. The mean p21 Cip1 mRNA expression level in tumor tissues was significantly suppressed compared to that of non-tumor tissues, irrespective of p53 gene mutations. In p53 gene mutation-detected cases, the mean expression level of p21 Cip1 mRNAs of tumor tissues was about 60% of that of cases without p53 gene mutation. Moreover, the relative mRNA expression levels of p21 Cip1 significantly decreased as the pathohistological stages progressed by Dukes' staging system, while in patients with liver metastasis these levels were significantly suppressed compared to those of patients without organ metastasis. These results indicate that reduced expression of p21 Cip1 mRNA is critical for growth activity and malignant potential of human colorectal carcinoma, and that the decrease in p21 Cip1 mRNA level is due to p53 gene mutation as well as other mechanisms during human colorectal carcinogenesis",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we analyzed 53 oral squamous-cell carcinomas among Indians for the presence of alterations in the tumor-suppressor gene p53 by PCR-SSCP and sequencing methods. Our results showed that 21% (11/53) of oral carcinomas analyzed carried mutations within the exons 5-8 of the p53 gene. We have identified 11 single-base pair substitutions consisting of 10 mis-sense mutations and one at the splice acceptor site, and one deletion mutation involving 4 consecutive bases. The majority of the base substitutions were transitions (5 TA to CG and 5 GC to AT), while only one transversion (TA to GC) was observed. Probable hot-spots for the mutation induction were identified at codons 149 and 274, which have not been observed before in head-and- neck cancers. The mutational spectrum might have originated from base alkylations at guanine and thymine residues, caused by some alkylating agents. The present results are thus consistent with the involvement of tobacco-related nitrosoamines in the etiology of oral squamous-cell carcinoma",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in the non-neoplastic mucosa of the human stomach showing intestinal metaplasia",
    "Abstract": "In order to ascertain whether genetic alterations occur during the early stages of gastric carcinogenesis, abnormal accumulation of p53 protein and mutation of its gene in stomach tissue showing intestinal metaplasia were investigated using immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. Immunohistochemistry detected 19 foci showing nuclear accumulation of p53 protein in non-neoplastic gastric mucosa in a total of 756 sections (477 of which contained intestinal metaplasia) from 16 resected stomachs containing gastric adenocarcinomas. Of these 19 p53- positive foci, 17 were diagnosed histologically as incomplete-type intestinal metaplasia and 2 as pseudopyloric glands in the regenerative mucosa. Furthermore, 14 such foci were detected in 6 patients with multiple gastric cancers. No correlation between high-iron diamine (HID)-positive sulfomucin production and p53-positive glands was observed. The DNAs were extracted selectively from these p53-positive metaplastic glands and examined for p53 mutations by PCR-SSCP analysis followed by direct sequencing. In only 10 lesions could exons; 5 to 8 be investigated completely, and of these, 4 were shown to possess p53 mutations, which were on exon 5 in 3 cases and on exon 7 in 1 case. These results indicate that irreversible genetic changes had already occurred in morphologically non-neoplastic gastric mucosa with intestinal metaplasia, and are consistent with the hypothesis that intestinal metaplasia, especially the incomplete type, may contain precursor lesions of gastric cancer",

    "Abstract": "The p53 tumor-suppressor gene is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer. However, p53 gene alterations are infrequent in renal-cell cancer (RCC). Bcl-2 has been shown to inhibit apoptosis triggered by wild-type p53 and an inverse correlation between Bcl-2 expression and p53 mutation has been observed in breast cancer and glioma. To characterize the expression of bcl-2 in RCC and its relationship to the p53 status, we analyzed 25 RCCs by immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2 and p53, Southern hybridization for bcl-2, and PCR-SSCP and sequencing for p53. Positive Bcl-2 staining was detected in 17 of 25 RCCs, whereas positive p53 staining was seen in only 1. Amplification of bcl-2 or p53 mutation was not detected in any of the tumors. Bcl-2 protein was expressed in all 7 RCC cell lines examined. Only one of the 7 lines had p53 mutation. These results suggest that overexpression of bcl-2, rather than p53 mutation, may prevent apoptosis during RCC development",

    "Title": "p53 mutations as a possible predictor of response to chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Although intrahepatic infusion therapy with 5-fluorouracil for unresectable colorectal liver metastases may lead to improved overall survival for some patients, it is not clear why a response is not observed in others. Gene alterations in oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes are critical events in tumor formation, and some of them could play a role in the process of drug resistance. The tumor-suppressor gene p53, which is known to trigger cell arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage, is found to be mutated in a wide range of human tumors. The aim of this work is to establish whether a relationship is found between p53 mutations and survival in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced Dukes' D colorectal cancers. Seventeen tumors from patients treated with 5-fluorouracil regimen via intrahepatic infusion for unresectable colorectal hepatic metastasis were considered. p53 mutations from tumor DNA were detected, after amplification by PCR of exons 5 to 8, by non-radioactive single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct DNA sequencing. Patients with mutated p53 colorectal tumors had short survival, whereas prolonged survival was associated with the presence of wild-type p53 (p = 0.019). Our data suggest that mutated p53 colorectal tumors had a weak response, or even no response, to chemotherapeutic treatment. Routine assessment of p53 status would be helpful in selecting patients with only wild-type p53 gene who have a predictably better response to chemotherapy",

    "Title": "APC gene mutations and allelic losses in sporadic ampullary tumours: evidence of genetic difference from tumours associated with familial adenomatous polyposis",
    "Abstract": "We explored APC gene mutations and chromosome 5q21 allelic losses (5qLOH) in 18 neoplasms of the papilla of Vater, including 6 early- stage tumours (3 adenomas, 3 carcinomas) and 12 advanced-stage cancers. Eleven PCR-amplified polymorphic sequences were used to analyse 5qLOH. APC mutations were investigated both by an in vitro APC-protein truncation test and by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Mutations in the Ki-ras, N-ras and p53 genes were also assessed. We found: 5qLOH in 8 of 16 cases (50%), including 1 adenoma, 3 early- and 4 advanced-stage cancers; APC mutations in 2 adenomas and 1 advanced-stage carcinoma; Ki- or N-ras mutations in 3 adenomas and 3 advanced-stage cancers; p53 mutations in 2 early-stage and 7 advanced- stage adenocarcinomas. Our results suggest that 5qLOH, APC mutations and ras mutations are present at early stages, whereas p53 inactivation is associated with progression of malignancy in a large proportion of cases. These data indicate that sporadic ampullary tumours differ from those occurring in familial adenomatous polyposis in the frequency (17% vs. 64%) as well as in the site of APC somatic mutations, suggesting a different molecular pathogenesis in the 2 conditions",

    "Title": "Overexpression and mutations of p53 in metastatic malignant melanomas",
    "Abstract": "Alterations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most frequent genetic abnormalities in human malignancies, but the role of p53 in the etiology of malignant melanomas is unclear. Fifty unselected malignant melanomas were analyzed for p53 overexpression by immunohistochemistry using 3 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Fifteen tumors (29.4%) showed positive staining with at least 2 different antibodies. In the first 20 consecutive tumors exons 5-9 and adjacent splice sites of the p53 gene were analyzed by genomic sequencing. There were 4 mutations in 20 metastatic melanomas. Three of 4 mutations were C:G-->T:A transitions. A search of our database of p53 mutations revealed that out of 8 p53 mutations reported by others, 4 are C:G-->T:A transitions at dipyrimidine sites, and one is a tandem CC-->TT mutation. This mutational pattern is comparable with the pattern of p53 mutations in squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and is related to exposure to ultraviolet B (UV-B) wavelength radiation. Taken together with a predominance of UV-induced mutations in the CDKN2/ p16 gene demonstrated in melanoma cell lines, our data support a role of sunlight exposure in the etiology of malignant melanoma. The low frequency of p53 mutants in melanomas compared with other types of skin cancers suggests that although mutations in this gene are likely to be involved in the development of some malignant melanomas, they do not play as large a role as in squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin",

    "Title": "Clonality and stability of the p53 gene in human astrocytic tumor cells: quantitative analysis of p53 gene mutations by yeast functional assay",
    "Abstract": "Mutation of the p53 gene is found in about one third of astrocytic brain tumors, and expansion of tumor cell clones containing mutant p53 has been implicated in astrocytic tumor progression. However, admixture of normal cells in astrocytic tumor specimens limits the power of traditional studies of tumor cell clonality. To address this problem we have employed a yeast p53 functional assay that scores the content of mutant p53 alleles in tumors and cell lines quantitatively. We have analyzed 17 cases where matching tumor material and derived cell lines were available. The yeast assay gave > 20% red (i.e., mutant p53- containing) yeast colonies in 7 out of 17 cases. One case had no mutations in the primary tumor but gave 76% red colonies in a recurrence, clearly demonstrating tumor overgrowth by a mutant clone. During early passages of cultured tumor cells, mutant p53 content increased rapidly with passage due to outgrowth of mutant clones from a heterogeneous starting population. In addition, de novo p53 mutations appeared during culture in 2 cases. This indicates that there is stronger selective pressure for mutation during the establishment of cell lines in vitro than during tumor growth in vivo. Our results demonstrate the utility of the p53 functional assay for studies of clonality and support the hypothesis of clonal progression of brain tumors in vivo",

The frequency of p53 mutation, however, in established cell lines with integrated HBV DNA and/or HBX has not been well studied. To know p53 mutational frequency, and to investigate whether the presence of HBX DNA sequence correlates with the absence of p53 mutation in the established HCC cell lines, we studied the p53 mutation and the presence of HBX sequence in 12 recently characterized HCC cell lines. As a result, all 12 (100%) lines showed mutation in the p53 gene. Three (25%) cell lines had transversion of codon 215 while no mutation of codon 249 was found. In contrast with previous reports, although HBX DNA was present in 11 cell lines, p53 mutation had occurred, indicating that the presence of HBX viral DNA does not correlate with a lack of p53 mutation in established HCC cell lines. Our results suggest that the frequency of p53 mutation is extremely high even in HBX DNA positive HCC cell lines",

    "Title": "Mutations and polymorphisms in the p53, p21 and p16 genes in oral carcinomas of Indian betel quid chewers",
    "Abstract": "India has one of the world's highest incidences of oral cancer. It is believed that the widespread habit of betel quid chewing is an important risk factor as it exposes the oral mucosa to known carcinogens. It also induces physical abrasions, which may create mitogenic environments during wound healing as gateways for infections. A recent study from our laboratories identified human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, mostly of the high-risk types HPV-16 and HPV-18, in 67 of 91 oral cancer lesions from a cohort of Indian patients consisting mostly of betel quid users. This suggested a viral etiology of some lesions but tumorigenesis in the absence of viruses in other lesions. Here, we examined whether the p53 gene, whose function is abrogated by the product of the HPV gene E6, would be mutated in those oral cancers that were free of HPV DNA, and we found point mutations at known hot spots for mutational alteration of p53 in 4 of 23 lesions. We also considered the possibility that p21, a target of regulation by the p53 protein, may be mutationally altered in tumors with a functional p53 gene. While we did not identify mutations in the p21 gene, 6 of 11 lesions contained a polymorphism that may be associated with cancer. Interestingly, 3 of 23 lesions had mutations in the p16 gene, a third regulator of the cell cycle which is frequently mutated in melanoma but rarely in other cancers, with 1 lesion even having a mutation in the p53 as well as in the p16 gene. Our data point to p53 and p16 as gene targets of oral carcinogenesis, with chemicals in the betel quid possibly functioning in these tumors as carcinogens",

    "Abstract": "We screened 29 human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESC) cell lines for mutations of the p53 gene through all coding exons and exon- intron junctions. Mutations were found in 22 cell lines (76%), consisting of 20 single-base substitutions, 2 small deletions and 1 single-base insertion. Out of 20 single-base substitution, 5 were located at the exon-intron junctions and mRNAs with abnormal splicing were detected by RT-PCR in 4 of them. A G:C to T:A transversion, which occurred rather frequently in resected tumors of ESC, was observed in only 1 cell line, and, instead, frequent transitions at CpG sites were detected. We also examined 65 fresh tumor materials, from all of which we tried to establish cell lines, and detected mutations in 26 samples (40%). Compared with the results in these fresh tumor materials, the mutation incidence in cell lines was significantly high and the mutation spectrum was also different. From these 65 tumors, 10 cell lines were established, including 3 cell lines from 26 tumors with p53 mutations and 7 cell lines from 39 without mutations, which indicates that there was no significant correlation between the status of the p53 gene in each fresh tumor and its establishment as a cell line. In 7 cell lines established from mutation-free tumors, newly acquired mutations were detected in 5, which suggests that mutations might occur during the process of establishing cell lines",

METHODS: We investigated the factors modulating adjuvant cancer therapies by examining p53 gene mutations and chromosome 17p allelic losses in 15 rectal cancers treated by a preoperative combined therapy consisting of radiation, intraluminal hyperthermia and 5-fluorouracil suppositories. RESULTS: The point mutations were detected in 7 of 15 (46.7%) tumors by single-stranded conformational polymorphism and direct sequencing. Allelic losses at chromosome 17p were also detected in 7 of 15 (46.7%) tumors by dinucleotide-repeat polymorphisms. There was no correlation between p53 gene abnormalities and the preoperative tumoricidal effect of the therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that p53 gene abnormalities do not directly increase resistance to the combined adjuvant therapy",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between p53 immunostaining and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products in 61 gliomas. Glioma tissues obtained from patients at surgery were analyzed immunohistochemically with the monoclonal antibody PAb1801 to detect p53 protein abnormalities. Amplified p53 cDNA from these samples was analyzed by direct sequencing. Four grades of p53 immunostaining were evaluated: grade 0 = no labeling, grade 1 = less than 5% labeled cells, grade 2 = 5-30% labeled cells, and grade 3 = more than 30% labeled cells. Twenty-six of 36 glioblastomas, 14 of 23 anaplastic gliomas, and none of two low-grade gliomas had positive p53 immunoreactivity. Direct sequencing of PCR-amplified p53 cDNA revealed that 10 glioblastomas, 11 anaplastic gliomas, and no low-grade gliomas had mutations. Comparison of p53 immunostaining and sequencing data revealed that among all the gliomas, mutations were found in three of 21 with p53 grade 0, one of 16 with p53 grade 1, seven of nine with p53 grade 2, and 10 of 15 with p53 grade 3. These results indicate a good correlation between the p53 immunostaining and sequencing data when the percentage of abnormal cells within the tumor was greater than 5% (p53 grades 2 and 3). However, the correlation was poor when the percentage of abnormal cells was less than 5% (p53 grade 1) because of the limited sensitivity of sequencing techniques. Thus, p53 immunostaining may be more accurate in detecting p53 alterations when the percentage of abnormal cells is small; however, in rare cases, p53 immunostaining may fail to detect mutations confirmed by sequencing",

After 4 years following diagnosis, a rapid deterioration of the clinical picture occurred, concomitant with the appearance of large lymphoid blasts in peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM) and ascites samples. A diagnosis of RS was made and cytogenetic analysis revealed karyotype evolution with trisomy 7 and del(17p) in addition to t(11;14). Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed 78% lymphoid blast cells obtained from ascites sample to be trisomic using a chromosome-7- specific pericentromeric probe. Whereas no rearrangement of the c-myc proto-oncogene was detected at disease progression, direct sequencing of p53 gene exon 5-9 revealed an exon 7 missense point mutation. This abnormality was not present in the CLL phase. Immunological staining with the monoclonal antibody PAb-1801, detecting the p53 protein product, revealed a negative pattern in the CLL phase, whereas 24% positivity was documented in representative samples obtained at RS. It is concluded that RS was cytogenetically related with B-CLL in this patient, suggesting the occurrence of a bona fide transformation and that the mutation of p53 exon 7, in association with the development of 17p deletion, possibly played a role in the development of RS",

    "Abstract": "A panel of 51 cases of essential thrombocythaemia (ET), in chronic or leukaemic phase, was investigated for p53 gene and RAS oncogenes mutations by PCR-SSCP-direct sequencing. No RAS oncogenes mutations were detected, but p53 mutations were identified in three cases: 1/27 cases (approximately 4%) in chronic phase not undergoing chemotherapy, 1/19 cases (approximately 5%) in chronic phase undergoing chemotherapy, and 1/5 cases (20%) which had progressed to leukaemia. Our results suggest that: (1) p53 gene mutations occur sporadically in the chronic phase of ET, independent of chemotherapy, and may contribute to the progression to the leukaemic phase in a limited number of ET patients; (2) the RAS genes family does not seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of ET, unlike other bcr/abl negative chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPDs)",

    "Title": "Midgut Carcinoids and Solid Carcinomas of the Intestine: Differences in Endocrine Markers and p53 Mutations",
    "Abstract": "Fifteen midgut carcinoid tumors and 5 solid carcinomas of the intestine with carcinoid-like morphological features were evaluated histochemically and immunohistochemically with respect to various endocrine markers and expression of mutant p53 protein. Direct sequencing of the p53 gene after PCR amplification was carried out on microdissected cells from all tumors. All investigated carcinoid tumors showed chromogranin and argentaffin reaction, but lacked nuclear immunostaining with p53 antibodies. In 14 immunohistochemically negative midgut carcinoid tumors, no mutations were identified. One carcinoid tumor devoid of p53 staining was, however, found to contain mutation in exon 6 of the p53 gene. In contrast, the solid carcinomas were essentially chromogranin negative but all displayed clearly positive p53 staining in a variable number of cell nuclei. Sequence analysis of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene in the 5 carcinomas showed mutations in exons 6 and 7 in 2 tumors and in exon 8 in 2 other tumors, while no mutation was detected in the fifth tumor. The carcinoid tumors and the solid carcinomas of the small intestine are thought to derive histogenetically from endocrine cells and enterocytes, respectively. The present results substantiate that divergent mechanisms operate in the development of the two tumor types",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutation analysis and antisense-mediated growth inhibition of human ovarian carcinoma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Targeting dysfunctional gene expression in the cancer cell with gene- specific therapeutics requires knowledge of the structure and expression of the designated gene. Because of the prevalence of p53 dysfunction in epithelial ovarian carcinoma, modulation of the expression of this tumor suppressor gene is an attractive target for gene therapy. We sequenced the p53 gene and analyzed its expression in 10 ovarian cancer cell lines. Only five cell line mutations were encountered, three associated with a loss of heterozygosity. Thus, neither p53 mutation nor allelic loss is required for ovarian carcinogenesis or propagation of ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro. SSCP screening, but not immunohistochemical staining, correlated with results of direct genomic sequencing. All p53 immunohistochemical- negative cell lines differed from that reported by another laboratory, underscoring the importance of the knowledge of target gene expression in a given cell line in a given laboratory. We designed pilot studies of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against the p53 gene based on our sequence data. Differential growth inhibition of the A2780-CP-20 cell line (mutant p53 protein), but not of the OVCAR-3 cell line (wild- type p53 protein) confirmed the potential usefulness of this strategy",

    "Title": "Poor correlation with loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17p and p53 mutations in ovarian cancers",
    "Abstract": "To define the target of chromosome 17p deletions, allelic losses in the 17p11.2 to 13.3 regions of 32 ovarian cancers were investigated. Twenty- one (68%) of 31 informative cancers had deletions on chromosome 17p. None of these 21 cancers involved deletions in the entire chromosome 17p even if deletions of a small chromosome region were infrequent. Of these 21, 17 cancers contained deletions at 17p13.1 or neighboring regions. The remaining 4 cancers with 17p deletions were uninformative for deletions at 17p13.1. Thus, most 17p deletions seemed to target the 17p13.1 region in ovarian cancers. Of the 30 ovarian cancers screened, 6 contained p53 mutations. One p53 allele was lost as a consequence of deletion and the other was mutated in 4 cancers. Seventeen cancers with deletions on 17p showed no evidence of p53 mutations. Thus, deletions on 17p that are common in ovarian cancers are not always accompanied by p53 gene mutations",

    "Abstract": "AIMS: To analyse the significance of antibodies to p53 protein as a serological marker for changes in p53 gene expression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: Thirty eight patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 19 showing accumulation of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry and 19 having no accumulation, were studied. The presence of anti-p53 was tested using a novel ELISA utilising a recombinant p53 protein as a capture system and verified by western blotting. p53 gene mutations were sought by single strand conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing analyses. RESULTS: Of 19 patients with p53 protein accumulation in tumour tissue, 10 (52%) had antibodies to p53 in serum by ELISA. Four patients with p53 negative immunohistochemistry also had detectable anti-p53. Western blot analysis confirmed the specificity of the ELISA positive serum samples. The presence of anti-p53 was independent of serum alpha-fetoprotein and was detected in 50% of small tumours while only 8% were alpha- fetoprotein positive. Mutations affecting exons 5 and 6 seem to be more frequently associated with development of anti-p53, than mutations in exons 7 or 8. CONCLUSIONS: The ELISA for anti-p53 is a convenient and specific tet for the detection of humoral response to alterations in p53 gene expression and could be of value in the diagnosis and characterisation of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma",

As the main disadvantage with FNA is poor cellularity, the objective of this study was to develop a sensitive and reliable method for the assessment of the p53 status of the lesion. METHODS: Using PCR and subsequent direct sequencing, a method was developed that enables analysis of the p53 gene from relatively few malignant or suspicious cells in a background of normal cells. RESULTS: This method is both reproducible and sensitive. The sensitivity of the method is demonstrated and a mutant cell can be seen in a background of 90% of normal wild type cells. A mutation, not previously described in breast cancer, is also reported in a symptomatic FNA. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology is reliable and effective on samples with both variable cell numbers and quality of preservation, allowing it to be applied successfully to diagnostic cytology",

    "Abstract": "Expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD54) as well as the mutations of p53 gene were studied in childhood Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Expression of CD54 was identified in 6 of 15 fresh BL cases. Mutations of p53 gene, analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-single stranded chain polymorphism followed by sequencing, were found in 5 of 14 cases examined. Interestingly, all the cases with p53 mutation were CD54 negative. This high frequency of p53 mutation in the CD54 negative group prompted us to analyze the clinical features of these cases. Six of 15 cases died within 21 months after initiation of therapy and five of these were CD54 negative. In addition, four of these had p53 mutation. These results suggest that the lack of CD54 by BL cells may provide the background for the mutation of p53 gene to occur which could result in the transformation to a more aggressive phenotype",

A rearrangement of the P53 gene was evident by Southern blotting in 3 cases, one of which also showed the same alteration in the chronic phase. Single strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analysis showed point mutations in 4 blast crisis cases. Of interest, P53 point mutations were evident in all the 3 cases of extramedullary blast crisis examined and the same point mutation was found in the myeloblastoma tissues and in the subsequent peripheral blast cells. These data indicate that: a) P53 gene mutations occur in a significant but not a large number of CML acute phase cases; b) P53 gene point mutations seem to correlate strongly with the infrequent extramedullary presentation of the blast crisis; c) the presence of the same P53 gene point mutation in extramedullary and bone marrow blast cells confirms the common clonal origin of the two cellular populations",

Nuclear p53 immunoreactivity was observed in 36 of 80 carcinomas, 7 of 39 adenomas and none of the cases of regenerative atypia. Three of the adenomas demonstrated diffuse or focal p53 immunoreactivity. All three cases were associated with severe degrees of epithelial dysplasia, and two of them harbored carcinoma on subsequent polypectomy. Among 6 p53 positive carcinomas and adenomas sequenced, 3 showed DNA mutations, all G:C to A:T transitions.

    "Abstract": "Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosomes 13q and 17p and mutations of the retinoblastoma (Rb) and p53 gene were studied in 28 tumors from 22 patients with chondrosarcomas. Allele loss at polymorphic loci on 13q was found in 36% of tumors and the frequency was much higher in grade II (56%) or high grade (40%) tumors than in grade I tumors (18%). LOH of 17p, which was detected in 25% of all tumors, was of low frequency in low grade tumors (8% in grade I and 20% in grade II), whereas 80% of tumors with high grade tumors were positive for LOH. These observations may imply that LOH on 13q and 17p contributes to the tumor development at different stages. In low grade cases (grade I and II), tumor recurrence was observed more frequently in primary tumors with LOH on 13q (86%) than those without (8%), suggesting the significance of LOH analysis in the assessment of biological behavior of tumors. Structural alteration of the Rb gene was found in one dedifferentiated tumor, and point mutations of the p53 gene were found in all of five high grade tumors, indicating that high grade chondrosarcomas were genetically equivalent to other high grade sarcomas such as osteosarcomas",

    "Abstract": "Oral contraceptives (OCs) are implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mitogenic stimulation may be the primary mechanism of tumorigenesis, but other factors may also contribute. Mutational spectrum analysis can provide insights into pathogenesis, therefore we analyzed the p53 tumor suppressor gene in 10 HCCs from women with a history of OC use. All were non-Asians whose average OC use was 6.7 years (range 2 months-13 years) and whose mean age at HCC diagnosis was 48.8 years (range 21-67 years). Each tumor was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, DNA sequencing and allelic deletion analysis. Three tumors were positive by p53 immunohistochemistry; allelic deletion analysis identified loss of heterozygosity in one of four informative cases. Two p53 point mutations were found in one tumor containing moderately and well-differentiated components; this patient was negative for all serological markers of hepatitis B and C infections. Both components showed p53 protein accumulation and a GTTval-->GCTala mutation at codon 274. In addition, a silent mutation (ACCthr-->ACTthr) at codon 140 of the p53 gene was detected in the moderately differentiated component of the tumor. These preliminary data indicate that p53 mutations are uncommon in OC-related HCCs. One of the two detected mutations was a G:C-->A:T transition at a non-CpG site, which is characteristic of DNA damage by free radicals. These data support a model whereby estrogens contribute to HCC development primarily through mitogen stimulation and secondarily by mutagenesis via hydroxyl radicals produced during estrogen metabolism. Confirmational analysis of a larger series is warranted",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 have been found in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) from many countries where HCC is common, but p53 mutations detected by direct sequencing in HCCs from the United States (where HCC is uncommon) have been reported only rarely. p53 Exons 1 to 11 were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and direct sequencing in HCCs from 12 patients from the United States and in adjacent non- tumorous liver from 10 of them. Abnormalities of the p53 gene were found in five of the 12 tumors, including mutations in exon 4 (one patient), exon 5 (one patient) and exon 8 (three patients). In all 12 tumors, a normal conformation of exon 7 was found; in five of these HCCs the absence of mutations was confirmed by direct sequencing. Thus, the mutations of p53 codon 249 that have frequently been found in HCCs from endemic areas apparently do not play a role in most HCCs in the United States. Since the mutations in codon 249 are thought to be due to aflatoxin ingestion, the data suggest that factors other than aflatoxin may be responsible for the p53 abnormalities in the patients from the USA",

To determine whether p53 mutations are etiologically associated with OCSCC development or are associated with exposure to specific carcinogens, we have analyzed the conserved regions of the p53 gene (exons 5-9) in 48 OCSCCs obtained from patients with varied tobacco and alcohol use histories by polymerase chain reaction/single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) and DNA sequencing analysis. Thirty-eight percent (18/48) of the OCSCCs exhibited a mutation in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene. There was a significantly higher incidence of p53 mutations in OCSCCs from tobacco users (predominantly cigarette smokers) compared to those who had never used tobacco. No increase in the incidence of p53 mutation was observed in tobacco users who drank alcohol. G to A transitions and deletions were the predominant mutations observed in OCSCCs from tobacco users. No specific pattern of mutation was observed in OCSCCs from those subjects who had never used tobacco. These data suggest that a history of tobacco use was associated with a high incidence of p53 mutations in patients with OCSCC and that tobacco carcinogens include a specific pattern of mutations in oral cavity tissue in vivo",

    "Abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor gene is commonly mutated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The most frequent mutation in HCC in populations exposed to a high dietary intake of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is an AGGarg-->AGTser missense mutation in codon 249 of the p53 gene. We analyzed HCCs from Monterrey, Mexico, for the codon 249ser hotspot mutation. We also analyzed the serum AFB1-albumin adduct levels of the donors and family members to measure the current AFB1 exposure in this population. Moreover, the presence of hepatitis B and/or C viral infection (HBV or HCV) was analyzed serologically in the patients. Tumor cells were microdissected from tissue sections and exon 7 p53 sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA and sequenced directly. The serological tests for anti-p53 antibodies, HBV or HCV were done by ELISA. Immunohistochemical analysis of p53 protein was done using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum (CM-1). Eight of 21 cases were positive by p53 immunohistochemistry. Of the 16 cases sequenced for exon 7 of p53 three codon 249 AGGarg-->AGTser mutations were found. Serum antibodies recognizing p53 protein were found in one of 18 patients. Positive serology for HBV and/or HCV was found in 12 of 20 cases. The serum AFB1-albumin adduct levels in this population ranged from 0.54 to 4.64 pmol aflatoxin/mg albumin. These results indicate that dietary AFB1 and hepatitis viruses are etiological agents in the molecular pathogenesis of HCC in this geographic region of Mexico",

    "Abstract": "Accumulation of p53 protein occurs in human oesophageal precancerous lesions and even in near-normal oesophageal epithelium. In some instances, p53 gene mutations have been detected. In many of the cases of p53 protein accumulation in early lesions, however, p53 mutations were not detected due to either the lack of mutation or the low abundance of cells with a mutation. In order to enrich p53 immunostain- positive cells for single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing, an immunohisto-selective sequencing (IHSS) method was developed. Anti-p53 antibody-peroxidase stained oesophageal tissue sections were subjected to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to damage the DNA in p53 immunostain-negative cells. The immunostain protected p53 immunostain-positive cells from the UV light and thus preserved the DNA in those cells for PCR amplification. Comparison of the SSCP results from sections with and without UV treatment showed that the IHSS method selectively enriched p53 immunostain-positive cells. With this method, we could analyse mutations in samples with as few as 30 p53 immunostain-positive cells per tissue section. Analysis was carried out on tissues with precancerous lesions from six surgically-resected oesophageal specimens and 13 oesophageal biopsies from symptom-free subjects. The results of mutation analysis for some of the samples were confirmed by microdissection to enrich the p53- positive cells. The mutations in tissues with precancerous lesions were compared with those in the corresponding squamous cell carcinomas. The IHSS method is shown to be a simple and effective way to analyse mutations in p53 immunostain-positive cells. IHSS may also be a general method for molecular analysis of biological specimens after immunohistochemical staining",

    "Abstract": "The MDM-2 (murine double minute 2) gene codes for a cellular protein that can bind to the p53 tumor suppressor gene product, thereby functioning as a negative regulator of p53. In order to define the role of the MDM-2 gene in the pathogenesis of human acute myeloid leukemia, the expression and the sequence of the MDM-2 gene were examined in samples of bone marrow and/or peripheral mononuclear cells of 38 patients by using immunostaining, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single strand conformation polymorphism, and sequencing. Immunohistochemical staining detected a weak accumulation of the MDM-2 protein in AML patients of FAB classification M4 and M5. RT-PCR analysis revealed a heterogeneous expression pattern of MDM-2 mRNA in AML samples of different FAB classification. An increased level of MDM- 2 mRNA expression was observed in 17 of 38 AML patients when compared to normal controls. No structural changes in a 488 bp region extending from nucleotide 890 to 1378 of the MDM-2 cDNA were detected using RT- SSCP and sequence analysis. In addition, heterogeneous expression of p53 transcripts was found with the highest p53 mRNA levels in AML M4 and M5. Interestingly, there seems to be a correlation between the relative ratios of p53 and MDM-2 mRNA levels in AML M4 and M5: in 15 of 23 cases high p53 mRNA expression was directly associated with high levels of MDM-2 transcripts. An exclusively intranuclear p53 immunostaining pattern was found in 10 of 16 (58%) AML FAB M4 and M5, whereas the remaining AML samples tested were negative for p53 (0/10). Using RT-SSCP analysis and direct sequencing of the RT-PCR amplification products of p53 exon 5-8, we observed that only 1 of 38 AML patients showed a point mutation in the p53 gene. This missense mutation occurred in the evolutionary highly conserved region of p53 at codon 255 (Ile to Phe). These data indicated that structural alterations of the p53 gene do not play an important role in the initiation and progression of AML. However, abrogation of p53 tumor suppressor function due to MDM-2 overexpression may be an alternative molecular mechanism by which a subset of AMLs may escape from p53- regulated growth control",

    "Abstract": "Mutation of the p53 gene plays an important role in neoplastic progression in human tumorigenesis. Polymerase chain reaction-single- strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) techniques are now available for the detection of point mutations. The original method using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is disadvantageous, particularly for clinical tests and for analysis of large numbers of samples. Therefore, using an automated capillary electrophoresis (CE) technique with a molecular-sieving polymer solution, we have devised a completely automatic fluorescence-based PCR-SSCP system (CE-FSSCP) for the differential detection of point mutations that dose not require SSCP with radioisotopes and polyacrylamide gels. The automatic CE-FSSCP system was developed for reproducible operations in the denaturation of double-stranded DNA and electrophoresis of single-stranded DNA. The detection system consists of a 100 W I2 lamp and photomultiplier. We performed CE-FSSCP with a 2% linear polyacrylamide polymer solution containing 5% glycerol. Four tissue specimens of lung tumors with mutations in exon 7 of the p53 gene were found to have mutant alleles; six-base-pair deletion at codons 247-248, a one-base-pair deletion at codon 260, a one-base-pair deletion at codon 244 and a GGC to CGC substitution at codon 244. We expect this technique to prove useful for the clinical DNA diagnosis of human cancers, determination of the therapeutic effect of anticancer agents and for the study of the molecular aspects of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of human cancers",

    "Title": "Human papilloma virus and p53 in head and neck cancer: clinical correlates and survival",
    "Abstract": "Recent studies have shown that p53 mutations are frequently found in cancer of the head and neck, whereas others have indicated that human papilloma virus (HPV) infection may be involved. Thus far, no studies have examined both p53 and HPV in the same patient population and correlated the results with clinical characteristics and outcome. The purpose of this study was to examine any interrelationship between p53 and HPV in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. We also planned to correlate the experimental findings with clinical characteristics, known risk factors, and treatment outcome to determine whether any prognostic factors could be detected. Archival material from 66 patients with SCC of the head and neck were selected for study based on the availability of tissue from the primary tumors prior to treatment. A data base was constructed containing all clinical parameters at the time of diagnosis and risk factors. Genomic DNA was isolated and amplified using PCR, followed by SSCP analysis and direct genomic sequencing of all variants to detect p53 mutations. Two independent methods were used for HPV detection: (a) PCR amplification using primers homologous to the E6 region of HPV 16, 18, and 33, followed by RFLP analysis; and (b) PCR amplification with HPV L1 consensus primers, followed by triple restriction enzyme digestion. The results were entered into the data base for statistical analysis. Twenty-four percent of patients were found to have p53 mutations, and 18% were positive for HPV infection. Only one patient was positive for both. Tonsilar cancer was strongly correlated with HPV (P = 0.0001) and inversely correlated with p53 (P = 0.03). The only clinical parameter associated with p53 mutation was a trend toward a heavier smoking history. A subset analysis of the patients with tonsilar cancer revealed inverse correlations with smoking (P = 0. 015) and alcohol use (P = 0.05). Also, white patients with SCC of the tonsil were more likely to be HPV positive (P = 0.015). No significant relationships with outcome were detected with either p53 or HPV in the entire population. A subset analysis of patients with stage IV disease revealed that HPV infection was correlated with overall survival. This is the largest study to date to examine both p53 and HPV in patients with SCC of the head and neck. Our results suggest that HPV may be involved in the development of these cancers in patients without traditional risk factors and that HPV-related cancers are more prevalent in the white race",

    "Title": "Genetic analysis of second primary lung cancers in patients surviving small cell lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "We performed genetic analysis on 12 second primary non-small cell lung cancers in patients surviving small cell lung cancer to assess the potential contribution of smoking to the development of these tumors. Mutations of TP53 were found in three (25%) tumors, KRAS2 in three (25%) tumors, and CDKN2 in two (18%) tumors. Four (50%) mutations (one each in TP53 and CDKN2 and two in KRAS2) were G:C to T:A transversions on the coding strand, a mutation accounting for approximately one-third of mutations in smoking-related tumors but uncommonly found in lung cancers not associated with smoking. The genetic changes in these second lung cancers are more representative of smoking-associated malignancies than lung cancers arising in patients occupationally exposed to irradiation and atomic bomb survivors",

    "Title": "Clonal analysis of bilateral breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "Forty-nine pairs of bilateral breast tumors (41 synchronous and 8 asynchronous cases) were examined for X-chromosome inactivation status and p53 mutations to address the issue of their clonality. Among 12 cases that were informative for the trinucleotide repeat polymorphism in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome, 3 cases were found to have different alleles of the locus inactivated in the right and left breast tumors, indicating that the two tumors arose from distinct transformed cells. Thirteen tumors (13%) from 11 women (22%) contained somatic mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene. In two cases, both breast tumors harbored p53 mutations, but the specific mutations were not identical. Seven synchronous and two asynchronous cases had p53 mutations in one tumor only. A germ line p53 mutation at codon 248, one of the most common p53 mutations in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, was observed in one case. Immunohistochemical analysis of p53 protein with a monoclonal antihuman p53 antibody showed concordant positivity between the right and left tumors in three bilateral breast cancer cases. Our results suggest that at least some bilateral breast tumors originate from distinct cells, but that some bilateral breast tumors may be related through a common p53 abnormality",

    "Title": "Increased radiosensitivity is associated with p53 mutations in cell lines derived from oral cavity carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "The curability of oral cavity carcinomas, as well as of other head and neck cancers, varies remarkably especially in more advanced disease. Radiotherapy and surgery, including large operations, are currently combined, but as new radiotherapy regimens are being introduced, the need for predictive assays has increased in order to plan a suitable individual treatment for the patient. Variations in intrinsic radiation sensitivity of cancer cells cannot alone explain differences in therapy outcome, and thus additional predictive variables have to be searched. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are found in most head and neck tumors, which has led us to study the possible association between these mutations and radiation sensitivity. We analyzed 16 cell lines from oral cavity carcinomas and found a remarkable variation in radiosensitivity (AUC 1.7-2.3 Gy and SF2 0.31-0.51). The p53 gene was mutated in 11/16 cell lines, and these cells were also significantly more sensitive than those with wildtype p53 (AUC 1.9 +/- 0.2 Gy and 2.3 +/- 0.2 Gy, respectively, p = 0.023). Structural alterations in the p53 gene were also observed in three of the relatively resistant cell lines, which indicates that not all mutations are critical in this respect",

    "Abstract": "Fifty-two cases of malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) were evaluated for amplification of the MDM2 gene, mutation of the P53 gene, accumulation of the P53 gene product, and their relation to disease- free and overall survival. All tests were carried out on formalin- fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Amplification of the MDM2 gene was detected in 15 of 52 cases (29%). Six of 52 cases (12%) demonstrated abnormalities of the P53 gene. Sequence analysis detected point mutations in four cases and a 1-base pair deletion in one case, whereas differential polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) indicated that the P53 gene had been entirely deleted in one case. Eight of 52 cases (15%) demonstrated staining for the P53 protein in >10% of tumor cells. The presence of MDM2 amplification did not have a significant effect on either disease-free or overall survival. Patients with accumulation of the P53 gene product did not differ in disease-free or overall survival from patients without P53 accumulation. Survival also was not significantly different in patients with genetic aberration in P53. However, when the patients were stratified by histologic grade, the results indicated that patients with alterations in the P53 gene may have shorter overall survival",

    "Title": "Tumor suppressor p53 gene mutation in squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx",
    "Abstract": "Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism) and PCR-DNA sequencing analysis, we screened 61 cases of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma for mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene. Mutations were found in 31.3% (19 of 61) of the laryngeal cancers. Seventeen of 19 (84.2%) cases showing p53 gene mutations were stage III and IV, which suggests that p53 gene mutation is a rather late event in tumor development and is involved in the progression of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. A high frequency of G:C to T:A transversion (50%, seven of 14), especially G to T (35.7%, five of 14), was noted in laryngeal carcinoma samples in our study. This finding may point toward an environmental carcinogen (such as tobacco smoke) as an important agent in the genesis of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Most of the p53 gene mutations (18 of 19) found in our studies could change the protein and thus may cause an inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, strongly suggesting that p53 gene mutation plays a crucial role in the progression of laryngeal carcinoma",

    "Title": "Correlation between p53 immunostaining patterns and gene sequence mutations in breast carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "We performed p53 immunostaining in 82 invasive breast carcinomas by using two commercially available antibodies, one of which (DO7) was employed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. The other antibody (PAb1801) was evaluated in corresponding acetone-fixed cryostat sections. A greater percent of cases were immunostained with DO7 compared to PAb1801 (52% vs 33%); however, the staining was more often heterogeneous (6-50% cells positive) or focal (< or = 5% cells positive) with DO7 (9% vs 31%). To investigate the genetic relevance of p53 immunostaining, single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing were performed on exons 2-11 by using archival tissue samples of 18 cases that were selected on the basis of certain immunostaining patterns. Two (33%) of six tumors with negative staining for DO7 had gene sequence mutations; however, one of these mutations was a base-pair deletion that caused a reading-frame shift and the other was a base-pair insertion that resulted in a stop codon. Both of these tumors exhibited immunostaining with PAb1801, although it was weak and cytoplasmic in one case. Conversely, three (30%) of 10 tumors showing immunoreactivity in 6-100% of cells with both reagents lacked a gene sequence mutation. Of the remaining seven tumors that were positive by SSCP, six contained a point mutation resulting in a base-pair substitution. Despite repeat analyses, one of the cases positive by SSCP failed to demonstrate a mutation in the sequenced exons. Four (80%) of five cases with heterogeneous DO7 immunoreactivity (that is, 6-50% of nuclei positive) were positive for gene sequence mutation. Neither of two cases showing focal DO7 nuclear staining in < 5% of tumor cells contained a mutation in the sequenced exons, and neither of these cases was strongly positive with PAb1801. Staining for either antibody was significantly associated with adverse outcome, as determined by disease recurrence at 52 months median follow-up (DO7, p = 0.01; and PAb1801 p = 0.002, chi-squared test). We conclude that a variety of factors may account for discrepancies when immunohistology is used to evaluate p53 status. These include fixation artifacts, differing epitope specificities of monoclonal reagents, presence of immunohistologically 'silent' mutations and, possibly, aberrant overexpression of wild-type protein",

    "Title": "Low frequency of p53 mutations in human thyroid tumours; p53 and Ras mutation in two out of fifty-six thyroid tumours",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: p53 is a well-known nuclear phosphoprotein encoded by a suppressor gene know to be mutated in various kinds of human tumours. A relationship between p53 gene mutation and tumour progression seems to be a common feature of several neoplasias. DESIGN: In order to investigate the role of p53 mutations in human thyroid tumours, DNA samples derived from fifty-six neoplastic tissues, ranging from benign adenomas to undifferentiated carcinomas, were examined for the presence of p53 gene mutations. METHODS: The analysis has been conducted using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the exons 5-9 of the p53 gene followed by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequence analyses. RESULTS: One anaplastic carcinoma and one papillary carcinoma showed p53 gene mutations in exons 5 and 8, respectively. A cell line established from the papillary carcinoma showed the same mutation present in the original tumour. Both p53 mutations were heterozygous. The p53 positive samples were analysed for other genetic alterations frequently detected in human thyroid carcinomas (mutations of the RET, TRK, and ras oncogenes): both p53-mutated samples proved to be mutated at level of codon 13 of the c-Ki-ras gene. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that p53 gene alterations are rare in well-differentiated thyroid tumours, that they are an important requirement for the establishment in culture of human thyroid carcinoma cell lines, and that they can be associated with other genetic alterations, namely ras mutations, in the malignant progression of thyroid tumours",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Microsatellite instability (replication error [RER]) is a characteristic of tumors in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), but the mechanism of HNPCC carcinogenesis is not yet understood. To clarify the nature of HNPCC tumors, RER and genetic changes were compared between HNPCC and non-HNPCC tumors. METHODS: RER and genetic changes were analyzed in 21 HNPCC, 389 familial adenomatous polyposis, and 206 sporadic tumors using polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism, sequencing, and Southern hybridization. RESULTS. in HNPCC, 95% tumors at all stages showed RER positivity (altered loci, 4.3 of 5). In familial adenomatous polyposis and sporadic tumors, RER positivity (1.7 of 5) was 3% in adenoma and intramucosal carcinoma, 13%-24% in invasive carcinoma, and 35% in carcinoma metastasized to liver. Fifty percent of RER-positive HNPCC tumors had both germline and somatic mutations of hMSH2 or hMLH1 gene, whereas 6% of RER-positive non-HNPCC had somatic mutation. APC, p53, and K-ras-2 mutations and loss of heterozygosity of tumor-suppressor genes were significantly less frequent (P = 0.03 to 0.0006) but transforming growth factor beta type II receptor mutation was significantly more frequent (P = 0.000001) in HNPCC than in non-HNPCC. CONCLUSIONS: RER positivity occurs from an early stage of carcinogenesis in HNPCC but in later stages in non-HNPCC. Most HNPCC tumors may develop through different genetic changes from those in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, although a certain percentage develops through APC mutation",

Using predominantly formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded material, we performed polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis of exons 4-8 and direct sequencing. Molecular genetic findings were correlated with immunohistochemical detection of p53 protein. A total of eight alterations (19%) were identified. Two splice mutations were detected in one case of a highly malignant osteosarcoma and its metastasis, and in one osteoblastoma with focal malignant transformation. Four of the mutations were missense mutations, one was of the silent type. These data correspond to the results found in the literature on bone and soft tissue tumors. Therefore, retrospective studies of p53 gene turn out to be quite appropriate for molecular biologic examinations",

    "Abstract": "We investigated mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in B-cell lymphoid neoplasms with reference to oncogene rearrangements associated with specific chromosomal translocations. These included 15 patients with a BCL1/PRAD1 gene rearrangement and/or PRAD1 overexpression, 45 with a BCL2 rearrangement, 2 with a BCL3 rearrangement, 24 with a BCL6 rearrangement, and 6 with both BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements. Thirty-six patients lacked detectable oncogene rearrangements. Genomic DNA was isolated from involved tissues or leukemic cells obtained at diagnosis and/or at relapse, and established cell lines. Polymerase chain reaction-mediated single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing were performed to analyze abnormalities of the p53 gene. We detected p53 gene alterations in 18 of 128 patients, representing 21 of the total 151 materials analyzed. In the total of 66 patients with an oncogene rearrangement studied at diagnosis, only one had a mutation; however, 6 of 37 patients studied at relapse showed p53 mutations. Sequential analysis revealed that the p53 mutation was closely associated with transformation from follicular lymphoma to large cell lymphoma, exclusively in BCL2-positive lymphoma cases. Two of 13 mutations observed in oncogene rearrangement-positive cases and cell lines were transitions at CpG dinucleotides. In contrast, the relationship between p53 mutations and clinical behavior in oncogene rearrangement-negative cases was variable; 5 patients including one with indolent follicular lymphoma were positive for p53 mutation at initial presentation, and 2 of the 5 showed prolonged disease-free survival. Our findings suggest that p53 alteration exhibits diverse functions in the development and progression of B-cell tumors related to the presence or absence of oncogene rearrangement, and that chemotherapy-related influences may be involved in the occurrence of progression-associated p53 mutations",

Mutations of the p53 gene were found in two cases, at codon 244 (GGC to TGC) in the cholangiocellular carcinoma component of case 1 (mixed type, showing an intimate intermingling of both elements) and at codon 234 (TAC to AAC) in both components of case 5 (combined type, consisting of contiguous but independent masses of both elements). Mutation of the K-ras gene (codon 12, GGT to GAT) was seen only in the cholangiocellular carcinoma component of clinically apparent double cancer, case 6. Allelic alteration of the Rb-1 gene was observed in two cases, deletion of both alleles in the hepatocellular carcinoma component of case 3 (combined type) and replication error of the same pattern in both components of case 4 (mixed type). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the hepatocellular carcinoma components of five cases (cases 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) were immunoreactive for keratin, suggesting biliary epithelial transformation. In four of the five cases (cases 3 and 5 combined, case 7 mixed and case 6 double cancer), cholangiocellular carcinoma components were also positive for keratin. These results suggest that both components of combined hepatocellular- cholangiocarcinoma have the same genetic and phenotypic character and might have arisen from the same origin in some cases",

    "Abstract": "It is currently accepted that colorectal tumorigenesis results from accumulation of multiple mutations in certain genes. This concept prompted us to search for possible mutations in the APC, k-ras, and p53 genes in an advanced cancer coexisting with a large villous adenoma of the rectum in a 54-year-old patient with no family history of colorectal cancer. Genomic DNA extracted from multiple subregions of the tumor and surrounding normal mucosa was studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing. Both the adenoma and carcinoma had abnormal PCR-SSCP for APC (exon 11) and k-ras, irrespective of the location within the tumors. However, p53 abnormality (exon 7) was detected only in samples taken from the carcinoma. Subsequent sequencing revealed a TTG to TAG mutation at codon 479 of APC, a GGT to GAT mutation at codon 12 of k-ras in both the adenoma and carcinoma, and a CGG to TGG mutation at codon 248 of p53 (exon 7) in the carcinoma. These findings were in accord with the current concept of colorectal tumor progression whereby genetic alteration of APC and k- ras occurs relatively early while that of p53 is rather late and is possibly a decisive event in relation to malignancy",

The molecular study of p53 mutations not only provides prognostic information but also allows a better understanding of tumor biology. Most of the studies on p53 have been done by immunohistochemistry procedures. In this study we compare the sensitivity of immunohistochemistry and molecular genetics methods for the detection of p53 mutations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty tumors obtained from breast cancer patients that underwent modified radical mastectomy were analyzed for p53 mutations at exons 5 to 6 through PCR- single stranted conformational polymorphism (SSCP)-sequencing. Moreover, the tumor expression of p53 protein was analyzed by means of immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: All tumors could be amplified by PCR and analyzed by the SSCP technique. Six tumors (15%) showed and altered electrophoretic mobility. In these cases a mutation was confirmed by gene sequencing. On the other hand, only two of these six tumors were positive in the immunohistochemical analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the utility of the PCR-SSCP technique for detection of p53 mutations and suggest to be more sensitive than immunohistochemistry",

    "Title": "Polymorphic enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism as modulators of acquired P53 mutations in bladder cancer",
    "Abstract": "Occurrence or specific types of mutations found in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes may partially be determined by activities of toxifying or detoxifying enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferases (GST) M1 and T1, arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT2), microsomal epoxide hydrolase, and the cytochrome P-450 enzymes 2D6, 1A1, 2A6, and 2E1. In an explorative observational study, 69 bladder cancer patients were analysed for acquired mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. The same patients were studied for the polymorphic traits of xenobiotic metabolism given above which were characterized from blood cell DNA by molecular methods. In 20 patients, single point mutations in p53 were detected whereas five patients carried two mutations; thus in total 25 mutations were detected. Twelve of these were G:C-->A:T transitions, six were A:T-->G:C transitions and seven were transversions (three G:C-- >T:A, two A:T-->T:A, one G:C-->C:G, and one A:T-->C:G). There was no correlation between the types of p53 mutations and lifetime smoking or occupational history. In correlation with xenobiotic metabolism, 86% of the seven transversion mutations were found in homozygously deficient individuals for GSTM1 compared to only 44% of GSTM1 deficiency in the carriers of the 18 transition mutations of p53 (p = 0.06). A similar trend was seen for NAT2: six of the seven carriers of transversion mutations had two slow NAT2 alleles. No apparent associations were seen for the other polymorphic traits which were studied. In conclusion, low or deficient activities of two conjugating enzymes of foreign compound metabolism, GSTM1 and NAT2, may influence types of acquired mutations in p53 in bladder cancer",

    "Title": "Selective expression of mutated p53 in human cells immortalized with either 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide or 60Co gamma rays",
    "Abstract": "Many studies on in vitro transformation of human cells indicate that the cells must be immortalized before they can be neoplastically transformed, indicating that immortalization is a critical step in multistep neoplastic transformation of human cells. We immortalized three human cell lines by repeated treatment with either 60Co gamma rays or a chemical carcinogen, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, and found that all three immortalized cell lines have mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, p53. Direct sequencing of the reverse-transcribed mRNA and immunoprecipitation of p53 protein revealed that mutant p53 is selectively expressed in all the immortalized cell lines, whereas the genomic fragments of the immortalized cells contain wild-type and mutated p53 alleles. Although the mutated p53 is selectively expressed in the immortalized cells, expression of the wild-type p53 was induced by treatment of the cells with a hypomethylating reagent, 5- azacytidine, indicating that the wild-type p53 allele might be inactivated by hypermethylation of DNA. Actually, the entire genomic locus including the promoter region of p53 is hypermethylated in all the immortalized cell lines. Expression and phosphorylation of Rb was normal in these three cell lines. Thus, inactivation of both wild type p53 alleles and selective expression of mutated p53 seem to be key factors in the immortalization of human fibroblasts",

    "Title": "Alterations of tumor suppressor genes and the H-ras oncogene in oral squamous cell carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "The frequencies of mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). p53, and p16 (MTS1; multiple tumor suppressor 1/CDK4I; cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitor) tumor suppressor genes were investigated in 23 oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene locus and on chromosomes 3p (VHL; von Hippel- Lindau disease tumor suppressor gene locus), 5q (APC) and 9p (p16), and H-ras oncogene mutations were also studied in the same samples. Techniques employed were polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), DNA sequencing and PCR- microsatellite analyses. Mutations of the p53 gene were detected in 26% (6/23) of the tumor specimens. APC and p16 were not mutated in any of the 23 oral SCCs studied. LOH was detected in 17% (2/12 informative cases) at the Rb, in 33% (4/12) on 3p, in 17% (4/ 23) on 5q and in 30% (3/10) on 9p. Mutations of the H-ras gene were detected in 9% (2/23). The only correlation between these genetic alterations and clinicopathologic characteristics was that mutations of the p53 gene were detected more frequently in oral SCCs with lymph node metastasis than in those without it (P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that mutations of the p53 gene and LOH on 3p and 9p frequently occur in oral SCC and play important roles in the development and/or progression of this common malignancy",

    "Abstract": "The p53 gene is known to be one of the frequently altered tumor suppressor genes, involved in the oncogenesis of a wide spectrum of human malignant tumors. We investigated mutational events of the p53 gene in 18 clinically untreated prostate cancers. Direct sequencing analysis demonstrated that 1 of 18 cases harbored point mutation in the highly conserved transcript region. The case showed CAT at codon 273 instead of wild-type CGT, substituting the encoded amino acid form histidine to arginine. The case had previously revealed homozygous loci on 17p, including the p53 locus, by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The other 17 cases harbored neither mutation nor small deletion. It is concluded that point mutation of the p53 gene is a infrequent event in the oncogenesis of untreated prostate cancer",

    "Title": "Relationship between sunlight exposure and a key genetic alteration in basal cell carcinoma [see comments]",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin is the most common cancer in humans. Epidemiologic studies implicate sunlight exposure as one risk factor, but the limited association between BCCs and UVB radiation (i.e., UV radiation of a wavelength of 280-320 nm) suggests that additional factors must be involved. At the molecular level, not much is known about the role of specific environmental agents in the pathogenesis of BCCs. Point mutations of the types produced by UVB radiation are seen in the p53 gene (also known as TP53; chromosome 17p) of 40%-56% of BCCs. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 9q22, however, is the most frequent genetic alteration in these tumors, and its causative agent is unknown. PURPOSE: We investigated whether the genetic alteration in chromosome 9 is common to all clinical subtypes of BCCs and whether inactivation of this putative tumor suppressor is related to sunlight exposure. The presence of UVB radiation-related point mutations in the p53 gene was used as an internal control for sunlight exposure to the precursor cells. METHODS: Tumor and blood samples were obtained from skin cancer patients by a surgeon who used Mohs' micrographic surgical technique. Clinical information on each tumor included location, size, histologic, subtype and whether it was primary or recurrent and sporadic or hereditary. Sixty BCCs from 58 patients were evaluated for LOH with 12 polymorphic markers that span chromosome 9. A subset of 18 tumors was evaluated for point mutations in exons 2-11 of the p53 gene, and a subset of 26 tumors was evaluated for LOH by use of a polymorphism in exon 4 of the p53 gene. Associations between tumor characteristics and molecular alterations were tested by a two-tailed chi-squared analysis or a two-tailed Fisher's exact test, depending on sample size. RESULTS: In a clinically diverse series of 47 informative tumors, 32 (68%) showed LOH for chromosome 9q markers, irrespective of histologic characteristics or clinical behavior. Forty-four (94%) of the 47 tumors were from sun- exposed areas of the body, defined as the head and neck in both sexes, shoulders or chest in males, and legs in females. No association was found between chromosome 9q LOH and sunlight exposure, as assessed by either the location of tumors on the body or the presence of UVB radiation-related p53 mutations. Of note, there was a striking difference between the frequency of LOH on chromosome 17p (two [12.5%] of 16 informative tumors) and on chromosome 9q (32 [68%] of 47 informative tumors; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation of a gene on chromosome 9q22 may be a necessary event for basal cell carcinogenesis. The pathogenesis of mutations in this gene may involve factors other than sunlight in a large proportion of tumors. IMPLICATIONS: The limited association between sunlight exposure and BCC incidence may reflect an etiologic contribution of additional environmental agents",

    "Title": "Detection of cellular heterogeneity by DNA ploidy, 17 chromosome, and p53 gene in primary carcinoma and metastasis in a case of ovarian cancer",
    "Abstract": "An unusual case of a patient with ovarian carcinoma carrying the p53 point mutation in both metastases (omentum and lymph node), but not in the primary tumor, is described. The presence of a p53 single mutation (G:A) at the second base of codon 248 was examined by polymerase chain reaction-amplification refractory mutation system (PCR-ARMS) analysis. This case was examined also by fluorescent in situ hybrization (FISH) analysis and flow cytometry (FCM) to obtain further information at the single cell level and to detect heterogeneity within a population of cells. FCM analysis evidenced the same multiple aneuploid cell subpopulations in primary and in metastatic samples showing the presence of a cellular heterogeneity. FISH analysis showed a disomic condition for the 17 chromosome in the primary and in one metastasis, while in the other metastasis a monosomic together with a disomic subpopulation was revealed. Our results confirm the independent clonal evolution of the metastasis. The late mutation event observed only in metastatic specimens suggests the hypothesis that in the primary tumor the wild-type gene either does not perform its control role for unknown genetic structural events or the p53 gene in this case does not play a critical role in carcinogenesis",

The HPV 16 E7-immortalized HLEC cell line had acquired a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene, p53, during the immortalization process. Using immunofluorescence assay, nuclear accumulation of p53 protein was found in the cell line. These results suggest that HLEC cells can be immortalized in vitro by the cooperative activities of HPV 16 E7 gene and a spontaneous mutation of the endogenous p53 gene",

    "Abstract": "Aberrations of the p53 and Rb tumour suppressor genes were examined in 12 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-derived cell lines from different geographic areas and 9 local HCCs by restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphisms (PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequencing. The relationships between genetic changes and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA integration in samples were compared. None of the cell lines and tumours showed structural changes in the Rb gene, while 6 cell lines and 2 tumours had mutation or deletion in exons 5 to 8 of p53. Mutations include an AGG --> AGT (Arg --> Ser) transversion at codon 249 in PLC/PRF/5 and Mahlavu, an AAT --> AAA (Asn --> Cys) transversion at codon 200 in TONG/HCC, an AAG --> GAG (Lys --> Glu) transition at codon 139 in HCC-T, a CAT --> CGT (His --> Arg) transition at codon 214 in SC4, and a CCC --> CTC (Pro --> Leu) transition at codon 250 in SC8. In Huh4, an 18-bp deletion from codon 264 to 270 resulted in loss of Leu-Gly-Arg-Asn-Ser-Phe from the amino acid sequences 265 to 270, whereas Hep3B had a 7-kb deletion after exon 7 of p53. Our data indicate that whereas Rb may not have pleiotropic effects on HCC, p53 aberrations are frequently involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. Further, HBV infection appears to be unrelated to the micro-genetic changes of p53. The G to T codon-249-mutation is consistent with HCCs arising from areas at high risk for both aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) exposure and HBV infection",

    "Abstract": "Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is a low-grade glioma that may recur as a malignant diffuse astrocytoma such as glioblastoma (GBM). While the molecular genetic basis of diffuse astrocytomas has been studied extensively, PXAs have not been analyzed in detail. We, therefore analyzed DNA from archival primary and recurrent PXAs from eight patients (three grade II PXAs without recurrence, one grade II PXA with recurrence as grade II PXA, two grade II PXAs with progression to GBM, and two grade III anaplastic PXAs with recurrence as grade III anaplastic PXA or GBM) for genetic changes associated with diffuse astrocytomas. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of p53 exons 5-8 revealed migration shifts in two cases, one primary PXA without recurrence and one recurrent grade II PXA in which the primary tumor did not show a shift. DNA sequencing showed two missense mutations in codons 220 (exon 6) and 292 (exon 8), respectively, mutations which have not been previously noted in astrocytomas. Differential polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification in only one tumor, a GBM without allelic loss of chromosome 10 that was the second GBM recurrence of an initial grade II PXA. Loss of heterozygosity studies on tumors from five patients, using three microsatellite polymorphisms on chromosome 10q and three on chromosome 19q, did not disclose allelic loss in any recurrent tumor. These findings suggest that the genetic events that underlie PXA formation and progression may differ significantly from those involved in diffuse astrocytoma tumorigenesis",

    "Abstract": "AIMS AND METHODS: p53 tumor suppressor gene is involved in the development of esophageal cancer. However, its role is not precisely defined in the two types of cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma developed in Barrett's esophagus. The aim of this work was to compare the frequency and type of mutation of the p53 gene and the expression of the p53 protein in a series of 21 squamous cell carcinomas and 27 adenocarcinomas of the esophagus in a single institution. p53 protein accumulation was assessed by immunohistochemistry with the monoclonal antibody PAb 1801. The mutations of exons 5 to 8 of p53 gene were detected by denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis, and sequenced. RESULTS: A mutation of the p53 gene and/or an accumulation of the p53 protein were found in 85% of squamous cell carcinomas and 92% of adenocarcinomas, respectively. The profile of mutations differed with the type of tumor; large predominance of transitions on CpG dinucleotides in adenocarcinomas suggesting an endogenous mechanism, high percentage of transversions in squamous cell carcinomas suggesting a direct effect of carcinogens present in tobacco and alcohol. CONCLUSION: Mutation of the p53 gene is a very frequent event in the two types of esophageal cancer. The mechanism responsible for these mutations is different in squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas developed in Barrett's esophagus",

    "Title": "Alterations of the p53, Rb and MDM2 genes in osteosarcoma",
    "Abstract": "Molecular defects affecting tumor-suppressor genes are an important step in the genesis of sarcomas. For example, inheritance of a defective Rb or p53 gene predisposes the carrier to develop osteosarcoma, among other malignancies. In this study, we have assessed the occurrence of p53, Rb and MDM2 alterations in the same samples of osteosarcomas, along with representative samples of various other sarcomas. Point mutations of the p53 gene were found in 13 of 42 osteosarcomas and 1 of 8 leiomyosarcomas, and gross rearrangement of the p53 gene was demonstrated in 5 of 37 osteosarcomas. The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) was either rearranged or deleted in 7 of 37 osteosarcomas, 1 of 7 soft-tissue sarcomas and 1 of 4 Ewing sarcomas. Remarkably, 5 of the osteosarcomas having Rb alterations also had p53 mutations. Amplification and overexpression of the MDM2 oncogene may lead to increased MDM2-p53 binding resulting in inactivation of p53 function. A two- to threefold increase in the copy number of MDM2 was detected in 7 of 37 samples, 5 of which were osteosarcomas. Amplification of the MDM2 gene occurred independently of p53 mutation; one sample having threefold amplification of MDM2 also had a p53 mutation. In summary, 34 alterations of the p53, Rb and MDM2 genes were found in 26 of 42 (62%) osteosarcomas",

    "Abstract": "Little is known about the role of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in radiation-induced thyroid cancer (RITC). In thyroid cancer, mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been largely confined to the more aggressive anaplastic forms. We studied point mutations in the p53 gene in 22 patients exposed in childhood to radiation in the head and neck area who later developed papillary thyroid cancers (RITC). Eighteen thyroid cancer patients without exposure to radiation, selected to match by gender and age the RITC group, were used as the control group. After histological identification, DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded specimens. Exons 5-8 of p53 were PCR amplified and screened for mutations by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and cycle sequencing. Four of 22 RITC patients (18%) showed missense point mutations. No missense mutations were found in the cancer control group. The missense mutations in the RITC group occurred at codon 208 in 2 patients, codon 177 in 1, and codon 217 in 1. The mutations were transitions from G to A and C to T. All patients with missense mutations were male and had lymph node involvement. Three of the 4 patients with p53 missense mutations had invasion of the cancer beyond the thyroid capsule compared to 2 of the 17 remaining RITC patients. None of the patients with p53 mutations had distant metastases or recurrence of the tumor. These results suggest that p53 gene point mutations may play a pathogenetic role in some radiation-induced, well differentiated thyroid cancers and in their local spread",

    "Title": "Establishment of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines useful for analysis of chemosensitivity and carcinogenesis",
    "Abstract": "Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is usually associated with a poor prognosis, with most patients dying within a few months. The mechanism of its carcinogenesis is unclear, and its rapid growth and spread often prevent effective surgical therapy. Thus, chemotherapy is necessary. However, ATC is often resistant to anticancer drugs. Therefore, prediction of chemosensitivity is important in selecting appropriate treatment. In this study, after the establishment of three cell lines (K119, KOA2, and IAA) from patients with ATC, we analyzed them for abnormalities in certain oncogenes (myc, ras, ret, and c-erbB2) and the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Only one of three cell lines (KOA2) had a N- ras mutation [codon 61 CAA(Gln)-->CGA(Arg)] and a p53 gene mutation [exon 6 codon 192 Caa(Gln)-->TAG(stop)]. We also investigated their in vitro drug sensitivity and compared it with clinical chemosensitivity, retrospectively. In vitro drug sensitivity was determined using an adhesive tumor cell culture system. Only the K119 cells were sensitive to adriamycin and cisplatin in vitro. The other two were resistant to them in vitro. These results paralleled the clinical responses. We also evaluated the in vitro drug sensitivity of a poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma cell line (SMP) and papillary thyroid carcinoma cell lines (NPA). None of the five cell lines expressed the multidrug resistance gene (mdr-1). In conclusion, we established ATC cell lines that are suitable models for characterizing the nature of multidrug resistance and carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Immunocytochemical detection of p53 in human thyroid carcinomas is associated with mutation and immortalization of cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 are the most-common mutations found in human cancers. In thyroid cancers, p53 mutations generally are found only in poorly differentiated and undifferentiated tumors and in cell lines. To determine the prevalence of p53 mutations in thyroid neoplasms and thyroid cell lines, we screened 58 thyroid tissues and 3 thyroid cell lines, p53 primers bracketing exons 4, 5/6, 7, and 8 were used to amplify genomic DNA using the PCR. Mutations were screened by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and confirmed by sequencing. The two papillary thyroid cancer cell lines and the follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line (positive control) had transitions (CGT->CAT) in exon 8, codon 273, resulting in the replacement of arginine with histidine. No normal thyroid tissues or primary tumors from which the cell lines were derived demonstrated exon 8 mutations, using this technique. p53 immunocytochemistry demonstrated a progression of p53 immunopositivity between synchronous and metachronous neoplasms, paralleling the neoplastic progression from a benign adenoma to primary carcinoma, regional, and distant metastasis and ultimately, the cell lines, where intense immunopositivity is noted. In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization, using probes specific for the p53 locus, revealed the presence of 3 homologues of p53 in the follicular cell line and 2 homologues in the papillary and Hurthle cell lines. These results suggest that a point mutation present in a small number of original tumor cells and amplification of the mutant allele may be responsible for immortalizing well-differentiated thyroid cancer cells into cell lines",

We detected the TP53 gene mutation in an anaplastic hepatoblastoma cell line, but no aberration of the TP53 gene (exons 5- 9) was found in tumor samples and in the other HBL cell line. The mutation of the cell line was a missense mutation from GAC (asparagine) to CAC (histidine) at codon 281, which was different from the G-to-T transversion of codon 249 that is frequently found in adult hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). In addition, we performed Southern blot analysis of the MDM2 gene, but we did not find MDM2 gene amplification in 19 cases tested. Our results suggest that, in contrast to the findings in HCCs in adults, TP53 gene aberrations are not involved in the development or progression of HBLs in children",

    "Title": "Molecular heterogeneity of B-lineage diffuse large cell lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "B-lineage diffuse large cell lymphoma (B-DLCL) arising de novo is characterized by a marked degree of clinical heterogeneity. To determine whether or not the clinical heterogeneity of de novo B-DLCL is reflected by heterogeneity in the molecular features of these tumors, we investigated the pattern of distribution of several genetic lesions in 70 cases of de novo B-DLCL at diagnosis. The panel of genetic lesions tested comprised the molecular alterations most frequently detected in B-DLCL, including rearrangements of BCL2, BCL6, and MYC as well as deletions of 6q and mutations of TP53. One or more genetic lesions were detected in 39/70 cases of B-DLCL. Isolated structural alterations of BCL2, BCL6, 6q or TPS3 were detected in 8/70, 10/70, 11/70, and 3/70 cases, respectively. No isolated MYC lesions were detected. Six cases carried different combinations of two genetic lesions, including lesions of BCL2 + BCL6 (1 case), BCL2 + MYC (1 case), BCL2 + 6q (2 cases), or BCL6 + 6q (2 cases). One case had accumulated three genetic lesions, namely a rearrangement of BCL2 and BCL6 and a mutation of TPS3. Overall, these data show that multiple distinct patterns of genetic lesions may associate with de novo B-DLCL, indicating that the molecular pathogenesis of this group of lymphomas is characterized by a high degree of molecular heterogeneity",

    "Title": "Distribution of TP53 mutations among acute leukemias with MLL rearrangements",
    "Abstract": "Acute leukemias carrying MLL rearrangements are characterized by a high degree of clinical and immunologic heterogeneity, as demonstrated by variability in their immunophenotype, consistent with lymphoid or myeloid/monoblastic derivation, as well as their occurrence in distinct age groups from infancy to adulthood. Recently, it was shown that inactivation of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene occurs frequently in cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia carrying MLL rearrangements. In order to assess the extent of TP53 inactivation throughout the immunophenotypic and clinical spectrum of MLL+ acute leukemias, we tested for TP53 mutations 29 cases of MLL+ acute leukemias displaying lymphoid (13 cases) or myeloid/monoblastic (16 cases) features and belonging to different age groups. Mutations were detected in 6/16 myeloid/monoblastic cases and in 3/13 lymphoid cases. Among myeloid/monoblastic leukemias, the TP53 mutations occurred in 3/4 infants, but only in 3/16 cases in other age groups. Overall, our data suggest that (1) TP53 inactivation is a relatively common event in leukemias with MLL rearrangements irrespective of the leukemic phenotype and of the patients' age; (2) at least two genetic lesions (i.e., MLL rearrangement and TP53 mutation) have accumulated in the short time (few weeks after the birth or conception of the child) corresponding to the development of acute leukemias of infancy",

    "Title": "p53 gene alterations and protein accumulation in colorectal cancer",
    "Abstract": "Aim-To correlate immunohistochemical staining with single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the p53 gene in colorectal cancer in order to understand how the findings provided by the two techniques complement each other in defining p53 functional status.Methods-Frozen tumour tissue from 94 patients with colorectal cancer was studied for p53 protein accumulation and gene mutations. Accumulation of p53 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry using PAb1801 and BP53-12-1 monoclonal antibodies. The findings were then compared with SSCP analysis of exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene. All cases with a positive result by SSCP analysis were confirmed by sequencing.Results-Nuclear staining was observed in 51 (54.2%) cases. SSCP analysis of the DNA amplified by PCR revealed that the electrophoretic pattern had shifted in 30 cases; sequence analysis confirmed the occurrence of a mutation in 29 cases and of a polymorphism in one. In 27 cases both assays gave a positive result, and in 40 both were negative; therefore, concordance between PCR-SSCP and immunohistochemistry was seen in 72% of cases.Conclusion-The data indicate that positive immunostaining corresponds with the presence of a mutation in most, but not all, cases studied; other mechanisms could be responsible for stabilisation and accumulation of p53 protein in the nucleus. Nonsense mutations which do not confer stability on the protein will not be detected by immunohistochemistry and false negative results can also occur with SSCP analysis.",

    "Title": "Analysis of p53 mutation and epidermal growth factor receptor amplification in recurrent gliomas with malignant progression",
    "Abstract": "Genomic alterations and expression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and the epidermal factor receptor gene (EGFR) were investigated in 22 patients with primary World Health Organization (WHO) grade II gliomas that on recurrence had progressed to malignant gliomas of WHO grades III or IV. Mutations of the p53 gene (exons 5 to 8) were found in 12 of 22 primary tumors (10 of 13 astrocytomas, 1 of 7 oligodendrogliomas, 1 of 2 oligoastrocytomas). In each of these cases identical p53 mutations were present in the respective malignant recurrences. In all instances in which the p53 mutation was associated with p53 protein accumulation (10 of 12 cases) the percentage of p53 immunopositive tumor cells had increased from the primary to the recurrent tumor. None of the primary low-grade and none of the recurrent high-grade tumors (7 anaplastic astrocytomas, 10 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, 4 anaplastic oligoastrocytomas, and 5 glioblastomas) showed evidence of EGFR gene amplification. Our results thus demonstrate p53 is mutated in a high fraction of low-grade astrocytomas with progression to anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas and that progression in such cases is frequently associated with an increase in the fraction of p53 immunopositive tumor cells. The general absence of EGFR amplification in our tumor series supports the hypothesis that the significance of p53 mutation and EGFR amplification may be different in glioblastomas that developed by progression from low-grade astrocytomas (secondary glioblastomas) compared to glioblastomas that developed rapidly in a de novo manner without a history of previous low-grade tumor (primary glioblastomas)",

    "Title": "Molecular genetic differentiation between primary lung cancers and lung metastases of other tumors",
    "Abstract": "When solitary pulmonary tumors are observed in patients with a history of cancer, differentiation between metastasis and primary lung cancer is crucial for appropriate therapy. Assuming that p53 mutations are conserved in metastases, mutation analysis of the p53 gene would be a valuable tool in differentiating metastases from primary carcinomas of the lung. In nine of 267 resected lung tumors, the origin of the lung tumor could not be defined histologically. Five patients had a history of colorectal carcinoma, one had a history of breast carcinoma, one had a history of soft-tissue carcinoma, and one had a history of head and neck carcinoma. One patient with a clear cell carcinoma of the lung had been surgically treated for both renal and thyroid cancer. Material from one patient with adenocarcinoma of the lung, histologically defined regional lymph nodes, and distant brain metastasis served as a control. We extracted deoxyribonucleic acid from the snap-frozen tissue of the unclassified lung tumors, from paraffin-embedded tissue of the previously removed primary cancers, and also from peripheral blood of the patients. Exons 2 to 11 of the p53 gene were amplified in separated polymerase chain reactions and directly sequenced. In all cases, the presence of germline mutations was excluded by analysis of peripheral blood deoxyribonucleic acid. The p53 mutation detected in the deoxyribonucleic acid of the lung tumor of the control patient proved to be conserved in the lymph nodes as well as in the brain metastasis. In two cases, the lung tumors exhibited a p53 mutation not present in the previously removed primary tumor and were therefore classified as new primary lung cancers. In five cases, the lung tumors proved to be metastases of the first tumor, exhibiting the identical p53 mutation. One of these lung tumor samples could be identified as a metastasis from the renal cancer, but the corresponding thyroid cancer material was different. For two cases, molecular analysis remained inconclusive. In one case, no p53 mutation could be found in the compared samples; in the other, no deoxyribonucleic acid could be extracted. Analysis of p53 mutations allowed exact classification in tumors for which standard methods failed to distinguish between metastasis or primary tumor. More than two thirds of lung tumors in patients with previous gastrointestinal carcinoma were revealed to be metastases, but second primary lung cancer could also be diagnosed. This diagnosis allowed correct surgical and adjuvant treatment of these patients",

    "Abstract": "Human cancer cells with a mutated p53 tumor-suppressor gene have a selective growth advantage and may exhibit resistance to ionizing radiation and certain chemotherapeutic agents. To examine the prognostic value of mutations in the p53 gene, a cohort of 90 Midwestern Caucasian breast cancer patients were analyzed with methodology that detects virtually 100% of all mutations. The presence of a p53 gene mutation was by far the single most predictive indicator for recurrence and death (relative risks of 4.7 and 23.2, respectively). Direct detection of p53 mutations had substantially greater prognostic value than immunohistochemical detection of p53 overexpression. Analysis of p53 gene mutations may permit identification of a subset of breast cancer patients who, despite lack of conventional indicators of poor prognosis, are at high risk of early recurrence and death",

    "Title": "Frequent clones of p53-mutated keratinocytes in normal human skin",
    "Abstract": "The multiple genetic hit model of cancer predicts that normal individuals should have stable populations of cancer-prone, but noncancerous, mutant cells awaiting further genetic hits. We report that whole-mount preparations of human skin contain clonal patches of p53-mutated keratinocytes, arising from the dermal-epidermal junction and from hair follicles. These clones, 60-3000 cells in size, are present at frequencies exceeding 40 cells per cm2 and together involve as much as 4% of the epidermis. In sun-exposed skin, clones are both more frequent and larger than in sun-shielded skin. We conclude that, in addition to being a tumorigenic mutagen, sunlight acts as a tumor promoter by favoring the clonal expansion of p53-mutated cells. These combined actions of sunlight result in normal individuals carrying a substantial burden of keratinocytes predisposed to cancer",

    "Abstract": "In order to ascertain the feasibility of detecting p53 gene mutations in patients with lung cancer in a nonsurgical diagnostic setting before starting treatment, we screened for p53 gene mutations in tumor specimens obtained using diagnostic methods such as fiberoptic bronchoscopy, thoracentesis, and percutaneous needle aspiration. We examined 206 specimens from 66 patients diagnosed with primary lung cancer at Hiroshima University Hospital between October 1991 and July 1993 using the polymerase chain reaction/denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique. p53 gene mutations were found in 64 of 159 (40%) cytologically positive specimens, but in none of 47 cytologically negative specimens. The PCR-based assay did not increase the sensitivity of the cytopathologic examination in detecting malignant cells. The type and location of the p53 gene mutation was the same in cytologically positive specimens obtained by different methods, but from the same patient. Of the 66 patients, p53 gene mutations were found in 27 (41%) at the time of the first nonsurgical diagnostic examination: 7 of 12 (58%) with small cell carcinoma, 9 of 20 (45%) with squamous cell carcinoma, and 11 of 34 (32%) with adenocarcinoma of the lung. The incidence of p53 gene mutation for each histologic subtype was comparable to previously published data examining surgically and/or autopsy-obtained specimens. These results indicate that detection of p53 gene mutations in a nonsurgical, diagnostic setting is feasible. This technique will make it possible to assess the significance of p53 gene mutations in relation to survival and response to therapy before starting treatment, in future prospective studies",

    "Title": "Discordance of p53 status in matched primary tumours and metastases in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients",
    "Abstract": "To study the use of p53 as a diagnostic tool in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), we analysed 15 primary tumours (PT) and matched lymph node metastases (LNM) for overexpression and mutations of p53. The primary goal was to study whether differentiation between primary and metastatic disease through their p53 status would be possible. Immunohistochemistry for p53 protein (antibody BP 53-12-1) was performed. Mutations of the p53 gene were detected by exon-specific amplification of DNA (exons 4-9), followed by exon analysis using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Mutant exons were sequenced. p53 overexpression was detected in seven (47%) of the PT and in seven (47%) of the LNM. 6 patients (40%) exhibited p53 protein overexpression in both PT and LNM. 2 patients had a different p53 protein expression in each sample. Mutations in the p53 gene were detected in 6 patients (40%) in the PT and in 7 patients (47%) in the LNM. In 2 patients (13%), the same mutation was found in the PT and in the LNM. 9 patients (60%) had a different mutation in each sample. We conclude that a poor correlation exists between p53 protein overexpression and p53 gene mutation in HNSCC. Also, a poor correlation for both detection techniques exists, when PT and LNM are compared. The p53 status may seem to differ between PT and LNM because of polyclonality in the PT. More sensitive detection techniques could be promising",

    "Title": "p53 mutations and occupational exposures in a surgical series of lung cancers",
    "Abstract": "p53 mutations are frequent in malignant lung tumors. Of 88 surgically treated lung cancers from cigarette smokers previously evaluated for p53 mutations, 45 tumors (51.1%) had mutations in exons 5-8 (D. G. Guinee, Jr. et al., Carcinogenesis (Lond.), 16: 993-1002, 1995). We report here the examination of 13 occupational exposures and 13 high- risk occupations in relation to these p53 mutations. Two molecular abnormalities were associated with occupational exposures: (a) G:C-- >T:A transversions on the coding (nontranscribed) strand (n = 13) were associated with chromate exposure and employment in the metal industry (P < 0.05) and marginally associated with nickel exposure (P = 0.056); and (b) G:C-->A:T transitions at non-CpG sites (n = 9) were associated with work in the petrochemical industry (P = 0.05). No association was found between p53 mutations and gender, cigarette pack-years, tumor histology, age at diagnosis, or family history of lung cancer. Because all three chromate-exposed subjects had large cell carcinomas exhibiting G: C-->T:A coding-strand transversions, follow-up of a cohort with this exposure should clarify the association with the p53 gene",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in lung cancer following radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease",
    "Abstract": "High risks of lung cancer occur after successful treatment of Hodgkin's disease. In addition to tobacco smoking, other risk factors include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunosuppression, although the relative contributions of each are unknown. We conducted p53 mutational spectrum analysis in second lung cancers after radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease in the Netherlands and in Ontario, Canada. Lung cancer tissues from 11 patients were analyzed by p53 immunohistochemistry and DNA sequence analysis. All were male cigarette smokers, all received radiation therapy, and six also received chemotherapy. The lung cancers occurred 9.8 years (mean) after treatment. Radiation doses to lung lobes that developed the tumors averaged 5.7 Gy (range, 3.7-11.7 Gy). Sequence analysis showed four missense and two silent p53 point mutations in five patients. There were four G:C-->A:T transitions; three of four mutated deoxyguanines occurred on the coding strand, and one was a CpG site. There were two transversions: one G:C-->C:G and one A:T-->C:G. Despite moderate or heavy smoking histories in all patients, the mutational spectrum appears to differ from usual smoking-related lung cancers in which G:C-- >T:A transversions predominate. The absence of G:C-->T:A mutations and the prominence of G:C-->A:T transitions, which are characteristic of radiation and oxidative damage, suggest that radiotherapy might have caused some of the p53 mutations. These data illustrate the potential of mutation analysis to determine causes of human cancer. If confirmed in a larger series, these results imply that some radiation-induced cancers can be distinguished from those caused by other factors",

We extended the study by using molecular methods to examine mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene in the same cases of bladder cancers. The same number of archival samples of transitional cell carcinoma, mainly of grade 3, were added to the analysis. We failed to show any association between occupational exposure to asbestos and p53 mutations among bladder cancer patients. We observed an increasing occurrence of p53 mutations in nonsmokers (5 of 17, 29%), former smokers (8 of 21, 38%), and current smokers (9 of 16, 56%) in that order; however, this was not statistically significant. The most prevalent type of mutation was G:C to A:T transition.

Our analysis of neuroblastoma cell lines with 1p and p73 loss of heterozygosity failed to detect coding sequence mutations in remaining p73 alleles. However, the demonstration that p73 is monoallelically expressed supports the notion that it is a candidate gene in neuroblastoma. p73 also has the potential to activate p53 target genes and to interact with p53. We propose that the disregulation of p73 contributes to tumorigenesis and that p53-related proteins operate in a network of developmental and cell cycle controls",

    "Abstract": "Alterations of the TP53 gene were analyzed in samples from 87 primary breast cancer patients, using molecular and immunohistochemical approaches. Mutations were detected in 17% of the samples, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and constant denaturant gel electrophoresis (CDGE) on exons 5-8 of the TP53 gene, and were confirmed by sequencing. Abnormal TP53 protein staining was found in 55% of the primary samples, using the monoclonal TP53 antibody DO7. A statistically significant association was found between TP53 mutations and abnormal protein staining (p = 0.002). Our results suggest that dysfunction of the TP53 protein is associated with tumor progression, as we found an association between TP53 abnormalities and accumulation of genetic lesions, measured as overall allelic imbalance (AI), homogeneously staining regions (HSR) and strong ERBB2 overexpression. Furthermore, patients with TP53 mutation had a highly elevated risk of dying from breast cancer during the study period (p < 0.001, RR = 10.68) at a median follow-up time of 42 months. Abnormal TP53 staining was much more frequent than the mutations, but it was not of prognostic significance, whereas strong staining was an independent prognostic factor. We therefore conclude that loss of functional TP53 leads to genetic instability, resulting in poorer short-term prognosis, and that only strong staining of TP53, and not abnormal protein staining in general, is of prognostic significance",

    "Abstract": "Although the cause(s) of clinical drug resistance in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) is unknown, in vitro studies suggest that abnormalities of the p53 gene, bcl-2 overexpression, and low tumor proliferation rates may increase chemotherapy resistance. We analyzed tumor tissue from 75 patients with relapsed/refractory NHL (Working Formulation A through H) for p53 mutation/overexpression (abnormality), bcl-2 expression, and tumor proliferation and correlated them with multiple clinical characteristics, response to therapy, disease-free survival, and overall survival (OS). All tumor biopsy specimens were obtained within 6 weeks of treatment with EPOCH (infusional etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin and bolus prednisone and cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy. Overall, 16 (21%) tumors had a p53 abnormality. Of 13 tumors with overexpression, mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis in 11, and, in 44 tumors without overexpression, 3 showed mutations. A multivariate analysis showed that tumors with a p53 abnormality were more likely to be drug resistant than tumors with normal p53 (56% v 17%; P2 = .008) and to have a shorter median progression-free survival (PFS; 2.1 v 8.2 months; P2 = .008) and OS (11.7 v 21.5 months; P2 = .038), respectively. The presence of a p53 abnormality did not correlate with any clinical characteristic, bcl-2 expression, or tumor proliferation. A significant correlation was found between low tumor proliferation and drug resistance in a univariate (P2 < .006) but not multivariate analysis. Patients with tumor proliferation of less than 80% were significantly more likely to have no response to therapy (31% v 6%) or to fail to achieve a complete response (16% v 44%) and tended to have shorter PFS and OS than did patients with higher proliferation. No significant association was found between bcl-2 expression and drug resistance, PFS or OS, although patients with intermediate-grade histologies and high bcl-2 expression tended to be drug resistant as compared with low level expressors (P2 < .065). Of interest was the finding of a significant association between high bcl-2 and low tumor proliferation (P2 = .0045). In studies that have found an association between high bcl-2 expression and short PFS, bcl-2 may have been a surrogate for low tumor proliferation. Further studies are warranted to examine this question. These results suggest that p53 mutation and low tumor proliferation, but not bcl-2, may be important causes of clinical drug resistance in NHL",

    "Title": "p53 abnormalities in B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia",
    "Abstract": "B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL) is an aggressive disorder of mature B cells with distinct clinical and pathologic features. To determine the incidence of abnormalities of p53, we analyzed 19 cases of B-PLL by DNA blot to assess loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 17p13.3, by immunocytochemistry to assess p53 expression, and by direct DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified exons 5 to 9 of the p53 gene. LOH was detected in 10 of 19 (53%) cases, p53 expression was detected in 8 of 17 (47%), and p53 mutations were detected in 10 of 19 (53%) cases. The pattern of mutations was distinct from that observed in other B-cell malignancies. Six cases exhibited missense mutations; 4 were transversions and 2 were transitions. The G:C --> A:T transition at cathepsin G dinucleotides commonly reported in p53 mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other hematologic malignancies was observed in only 1 case of B-PLL. Three cases exhibited deletions (ranging from 3 to 35 bp in length) and one case exhibited a 2-bp insertion. In 1 case, a 27-bp deletion resulted in the expression of a p53 protein lacking 9 amino acids from the DNA binding region. All samples with p53 mutation showed loss of germline p53 sequences. However, 3 of 10 showed no LOH by Southern blot, indicating a localized deletion around the p53 locus at 17p13.1. Five of the 10 cases with p53 mutation exhibited detectable p53 expression, including 4 cases with p53 missense mutation and 1 case with deletion. Two of 7 cases with no detectable mutation of p53 nevertheless overexpressed p53. Therefore, there was no correlation between protein expression and p53 mutation in B-PLL. Our data indicate that the overall abnormalities of p53 occurred in 14 of 19 (75%) cases of B-PLL. The frequency of p53 mutation (53%) in B-PLL is the highest reported in B-cell malignancies and may be responsible for the frequent resistance to therapy of this disease. In addition, the pattern of p53 mutation was different from that observed in CLL and other hematologic malignancies and may indicate that a distinct pathogenic mechanism operates in B-PLL",

    "Title": "Correlation between mutation in P53, p53 expression, cytogenetics, histologic type, and survival in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "In the biology of a cell, the central role of p53 in controlling functions such as G1/S transition (check point) and DNA damage repair, and as a trigger of apoptosis, is well established. Somatic mutations or other changes in P53 have been reported in numerous tumor types, and in some of these, they are associated with poor prognosis. In this study, we examined 237 cytogenetically characterized B-cell non- Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHLs) for somatic changes in P53 by Southern blot analysis, by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) of exon 5 through 9, and by direct sequencing of SSCP variants to determine the frequency and types of mutations and their clinical significance. In a portion of these (173 tumors), we also studied p53 expression by immunostaining. On Southern blots, no gross change was identified in P53 and no mutation was identified in exon 9. In exons 5 through 8, 27 different mutations were identified in 25 patients (23 single-base substitutions, 3 deletions, 1 duplication). Mutations in P53 were identified in 25 of 237 tumors (10.5%), which included 1 of 45 small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLLs), 2 of 38 follicular small cleaved- cell lymphomas (FSCCs), 2 of 35 follicular mixed small cleaved-cell and large-cell lymphomas (FMxs), 1 of 4 follicular large-cell lymphomas (FLCs), 1 of 14 diffuse small cleaved-cell lymphomas (DSCCs), 2 of 17 diffuse mixed small- and large-cell lymphomas (DMxs), and 16 of 84 diffuse large-cell lymphomas (DLCCs); the difference between the histologic groups was significant (P < .01). Among mantle-cell lymphoma (MC) patients, 3 of 10 had mutations. In 16 patients, the mutation was identified in specimens obtained at diagnosis. Mutation of transition type and transversion type occurred at a relative frequency of 2:1. Thirty percent occurred at CpG dinucleotide sequences and the codon for arginine was most frequently affected. Nineteen of 99 tumors with complex cytogenetic abnormalities, but none of 69 tumors with simple cytogenetic abnormalities, had mutations (P < .001). Similarly, 11 of 25 tumors with an abnormality of 17p and 8 of 143 tumors with apparently normal 17p had mutations (P < .0001). Positive correlations were found between a mutation and p53 expression (P < .001), between missense type mutations and p53 expression (P < .005), and between 17p abnormalities and p53 expression (P < .05). Twenty-two of 49 patients without mutation and 14 of 17 patients with mutations died (P < .05), but there was no significant difference in median survival. Similarly, 21 of 26 p53 positive patients died, whereas only 1 of 24 p53-negative patients died on-study (P < .001). Among p53-negative patients, mutation (P < .01) was positively associated with a fatal outcome. These findings indicate that in B-NHL, somatic changes in P53 were present in diagnostic specimens of all histologic types, but at a higher frequency in DLC and MC tumors. P53 mutation and/or expression has a negative influence on survival, and therefore can serve as prognostic indicators. Immunostaining for p53 is an effective way to screen for P53 changes in these tumors",

    "Title": "p53 alteration and human papilloma virus infection in paranasal sinus cancer",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inverted papilloma (IP) of the paranasal sinus is a benign neoplastic condition that can be associated with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). To understand the etiology of the disease better, paranasal sinus tumor specimens were examined for alterations in either p53 protein expression or genomic DNA sequence, and for infection by human papilloma virus (HPV). METHODS: Tumor specimens were categorized as follows: benign, nondysplastic IP; IP with dysplasia; SCC arising within IP; or SCC without IP. Sections of each tumor specimen were stained for p53 protein overexpression, and mutations in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene were determined in DNA purified from all tumor samples. HPV infection was screened by degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and typed by multiplex PCR and direct DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified HPV sequences. RESULTS: Altered p53, either in genetic sequence or protein overexpression, was observed in 0 of 7 benign, nondysplastic IP specimens. A significantly higher p53 alteration incidence was observed for IP specimens exhibiting dysplasia (57%; P < 0.05) and IP specimens that were associated with SCC (75%; P < 0.025). HPV sequences were detected in 9 of 24 (38%) tumor specimens, 78% of which were of the oncogenic HPV16 strain. A significantly higher incidence (P < 0.05) of HPV infection was observed in IP tumors exhibiting dysplasia or containing SCC than in nondysplastic IPs. None of the p53-mutated tumors were infected with oncogenic HPV16. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that p53 alterations and/or HPV infection are associated predominantly with IPs exhibiting evidence of dysplasia or IPs associated with SCC, but not in nondysplastic, benign IPs. In addition, an inverse correlation may exist between oncogenic HPV infection and p53 alterations in paranasal sinus tumors. The authors postulate that patients with IPs containing altered p53 may be at increased risk for SCC of the paranasal sinus",

    "Title": "A case-matched molecular comparison of extraovarian versus primary ovarian adenocarcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extraovarian mullerian adenocarcinoma (EOM) resembles primary ovarian carcinoma (POC) both histologically and clinically, yet little is known regarding the molecular genetic characteristics of this entity. The objective of this study was to compare the expression of three molecular markers of tumor behavior in EOMs and POCs. METHODS: Forty-four patients meeting strict criteria for EOM were identified and matched to POC controls for age, stage, tumor histology and grade, cytoreductive surgery, and survival. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine overexpression of p53 and HER-2/neu. DNA content was evaluated by flow cytometry. Direct DNA sequencing of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene was performed in nine EOM tumors. Statistical comparisons were made using chi-square, Kaplan-Meier, and Mantel-Cox log rank methods. RESULTS: Overexpression of HER-2/neu was demonstrated in 59% (26 of 44) of the EOM group versus 36% overexpression (16 of 44) in the POC controls (P = 0.05). Overexpression of p53 was noted in 48% of the EOM cases, similar to the 59% incidence observed in the control group (P = 0.29). Missense mutations were found in 9 of 9 EOM tumors showing strong p53 nuclear immunostaining. No significant difference in the incidence of aneuploidy was observed when EOM cases were compared with POC controls (65% vs. 63%). High tumor grade was strongly associated with HER-2/neu overexpression in the EOM group (P = 0.002). None of the parameters studied were predictive of prognosis within the EOM and POC groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although overexpression of p53 protein, p53 gene mutations, and abnormal DNA content were similar between EOMs and POCs, EOMs demonstrated almost twice the rate of HER-2/neu overexpression. This result suggests that distinct genetic events may be responsible for malignant transformation in EOMs versus POCs",

    "Title": "Molecular pathology of primary and metastatic ductal pancreatic lesions: analyses of mutations and expression of the p53, mdm-2, and p21/WAF-1 genes in sporadic and familial lesions",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The molecular pathology underlying the development and progression of ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma is poorly understood relative to that of other major cancers in industrialized societies. The frequency, nature, and distribution of p53 abnormalities, their temporal relationship to the metastatic and clinicopathologic phenotypes of sporadic and familial pancreatic cancer, and their consequent effects on the genetics and expression of critical wild-type p53-regulated genes (mdm-2 and p21/WAF-1) warrant examination in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This molecular and immunochemical study of the p53, mdm-2, and p21/ WAF-1 genes and gene products examined the largest series of nonneoplastic, neoplastic, and metastatic ductal pancreatic lesions reported to date in relation to clinicopathologic profile. METHODS: Histologically confirmed specimens of primary (n = 136) and metastatic (n = 23) sporadic and familial ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma lesions were subjected to immunochemical analyses of p53 expression in which a panel of 3 antibodies was utilized. A panel of nonneoplastic but histologically abnormal pancreatic lesions (n = 77) from individuals with varied histories of cigarette smoking were subjected to similar immunohistochemical examinations. In addition, 3 specimens from patients with chronic pancreatitis, 2 specimens of normal fetal pancreata, and 16 specimens of normal adult pancreata were examined as control tissues. Suitable frozen and archival microdissected tumor lesions were evaluated for mutations in exons 4-9 of the p53 gene by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and dideoxy sequencing analyses in which two distinct sets of outer and nested intron-based amplification primers were used for each exon. A subset of 25 tumor specimens and 18 tumor-derived cell lines for which the p53 mutation status was known were examined for amplification and/or overexpression of the mdm-2 gene; amplification was determined by Southern hybridization and overexpression by immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses. Similarly, mutations in the coding region of p21/WAF-1 gene were examined by SSCP and DNA sequence analyses, and steady-state expression of the p21/WAF-1 protein was assessed by Western blot analysis in these subsets of tumors and tumor-derived cell lines. RESULTS: Positive ductal nuclear p53 immunostaining was demonstrated in 56% of primary tumors and 54% of metastatic lesions. The frequency did not differ significantly between sporadic and familial lesions, and immunostaining was not observed in ductal, acinar, or islet cell elements of normal pancreata or histologically abnormal benign pancreatic lesions from cigarette smokers. A total of 70% of tumor samples revealed reproducible SSCP abnormalities for p53; 42% of these were found in exons 7 and 8. DNA sequence analysis of cases with greater than 35% epithelial cellularity (n = 25) revealed 17 missense mutations, 12 of which were transitions. Seventy-five percent of these transitions were of G:C-->A:T type. A total of 22% of the p53 mutations identified were microdeletions, along with one insertional mutation at exon 8. None of the normal pancreata from sporadic or familial lesions revealed germ-line p53 alterations. Moreover, the frequency and spectra of p53 alterations exhibited no clear, statistically significant association with tumor grade, TNM stage, or patients' cigarette-smoking histories. The mdm-2 gene was neither amplified nor overexpressed immunochemically in a subset of ductal adenocarcinomas, and there was no clear relationship between the p53 mutation status and the status of the mdm-2 gene or protein. Similarly, SSCP and DNA sequence analysis of the p21/WAF-1 gene revealed only 2 genetic abnormalities in a series of 25 primary tumors and 15 tumor-derived cell lines; 1 of the cell lines also revealed the absence of immunoreactive p21/WAF-1 protein..",

    "Title": "p53 mutation as the second event in juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Young patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are at increased risk of developing various malignancies, most of which are myeloid disorders. The observed loss of NF1 allele in the myeloid malignancies of NF1 patients suggests a role of NF1 as a tumor suppressor gene. Loss of 17p was found to be quite frequent in neural crest tumors from patients with NF1, raising the possibility of p53 tumor suppressor gene involvement in other NF1-related tumors. METHODS: The authors studied mutations in the NF1 and p53 genes, using loss of heterozygosity, single strand conformation polymorphism, heteroduplex and sequencing analyses. RESULTS: An NF1 germline mutation was identified in exon 31 of a child who developed juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML). The mutation was segregated within the proband's family. A 14bp deletion at exon 6 of the p53 gene was observed when JCML was diagnosed, and the wild-type p53 allele was lost during progression of the disease. No loss of the normal NF1 allele could be detected. CONCLUSIONS: A germline mutation in the NF1 gene and sequential inactivation of p53 alleles in the malignant clone of JCML raise the possibility of a correlation between NF1 and p53 genes in the tumorigenesis of JCML",

    "Title": "Mutation of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in human prostate and bladder cancers--investigation by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE)",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To test the value of a recently developed screening method for the detection of p53 mutations in prostate and bladder cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor tissue from 24 prostate cancers and 27 bladder cancers were evaluated. DNA of the critical p53 exons 5-8 were amplified and run on horizontal polyacrylamide gels under defined temperature conditions (TGGE) to yield specific gel shifts and sets of homo- and heteroduplexes in case of mutation. Sequencing with a laser- fluorescent electrophoresis unit was done directly from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products and/or from reamplified mutant and wild type bands excised from the gels. RESULTS: The p53 genotype predicted from the TGGE analysis was always confirmed on the excised DNA fragments, in contrast to only 50% of cases tested by direct sequencing from mixed wild type and mutant DNA present in PCR products. With this screening protocol, 6 of 24 prostate cancers (25.0%) and 11 of 27 bladder cancers (40.7%) showed p53 mutations. At stage T1, none of prostate cancers and 41.2% of bladder cancers contained mutant p53. At higher stages (> or = T2), 30.0% of prostate cancer and 50.0% of bladder cancers were mutated. Histological tumor grading was > G1 in all but two prostate/bladder cancers with mutant p53. It appears that p53 mutations can occur early in bladder carcinogenesis. CONCLUSION: TGGE fulfills the clinical need of a rapid and specific screening method, and, at the molecular level, has the advantage of sorting out the wild type and mutant alleles for consecutive sequencing",

Mutations leading to an amino acid change were found only in 6 out 20 chromophobe RCCs. Microsatellite analysis of chromophobe RCCs revealed the loss of one allele at chromosome 17p in 14 out of 18 informative cases. No mutation of the p53 gene was found in five sarcomatous RCCs or in seven tumours of stage IV. This study shows that mutation of the p53 tumour suppressor gene does not correlate with the specific loss of DNA sequences at chromosome 17 in chromophobe RCCs, nor can it be used as a prognostic parameter for RCCs in general",

    "Title": "Molecular genetic evidence for the conversion hypothesis of the origin of malignant mixed mullerian tumours",
    "Abstract": "The origin of malignant mixed Mullerian tumours (MMMTs) has long been debated, due to the indefinite relationship between epithelial and mesenchymal malignant cells. In order to obtain insight into the clonal relationship between the two components of these tumours, molecular genetic changes were investigated at the level of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in both cells types. LOH was studied in a series of six cases with 74 polymorphic microsatellite markers mapping to 19 different chromosomes. The epithelial and the mesenchymal neoplastic cells were separately microdissected from formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded tissue, prior to DNA isolation. LOH was observed for 35 different markers mapping to chromosomes 3, 6, 8, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, and X. The most frequently involved chromosomes were 17p, 17q, 11q, 15q, and 21q. LOH was observed in five out of six cases and identical alleles were lost in the epithelial and in the mesenchymal cells. No genetic differences were observed between the two cell types for any of the informative markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and TP53 mutation analysis revealed involvement of TP53 in all cases. Mutations were identified in five MMMTs. In four tumours, of which three had a missense mutation, strong nuclear staining for p53 was observed. In the remaining two cases, the mutation resulted in a stop codon, with no nuclear staining for p53 by IHC. The results support a monoclonal origin of MMMTs, with the absence of genetic changes uniquely associated with either of the phenotypes. The latter finding is compatible with current opinion that these neoplasms should be considered as metaplastic carcinomas and supports the conversion hypothesis",

    "Abstract": "Three hundred and seventy-four early-stage ovarian tumours, including 27 borderline tumours and 347 stage I carcinomas, were investigated immunohistochemically for overexpression of the TP53 and MDM2 proteins. TP53 (p53) and MDM2 alterations were detected in 15 and 4 per cent of borderline tumours, and in 50 and 13 per cent of stage I carcinomas, respectively. Mutations in the TP53 gene (exons 5-8) were demonstrated in 29 of the 50 stage I carcinomas studied, using denaturing gel electrophoresis followed by direct sequencing. TP53 overexpression was seen less often in tumours of mucinous and endometrioid type than in tumours of other histological types and more often in moderately and poorly differentiated than in well differentiated tumours. MDM2 protein overexpression was seen more often in clear cell carcinoma than in tumours of other histological types. These results indicate that TP53 abnormalities play a crucial role, and MDM2 abnormalities a minor role, in the development of early-stage ovarian carcinoma. There was no significant association between TP53 or MDM2 alterations and survival in multivariate analysis",

    "Title": "p21WAF1/CIP1 and MDM2 expression in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and their relationship to p53 status: a p53+, MDM2-, p21-immunophenotype associated with missense p53 mutations",
    "Abstract": "p53 is a tumour suppressor gene which is often found to be inactivated in most types of human cancer. p53 is a transcription factor, the inactivation of which may lead to significant variations in the levels of p53 downstream proteins, such as p21WAF1/CIP1 and MDM2. In view of the significance of p21WAF1/CIP1 and MDM2 as wild-type (wt) p53 targets, this study was undertaken to monitor the varying expression of these proteins in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) in relation to p53 gene status. A total of 57 cases of different histological types of NHL were included in this study. Proteins p53, p21WAF1/CIP1, and MDM2 were analysed by immunohistochemical techniques, taking the levels expressed in reactive lymphoid tissues as reference points. p53 gene point mutations (exons 5-8) were looked for using the PCR-SSCP technique and direct sequencing. Fifteen of the 57 cases studied showed 16 mutations at the p53 gene: 12 missense, one nonsense, two silent mutations, and one frameshift deletion. Most missense mutations were associated with high levels of p53 protein, while the nonsense mutations and frameshift deletion did not induce detectable levels of p53. All cases with mutation at the p53 gene (15) showed null or low levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 and MDM2 proteins, suggesting that null or missense mutations at this gene give rise to a protein that is unable to transactivate the p21WAF1/CIP1 and MDM2 genes. The association between missense p53 mutation and dissociate immunophenotype (p53+, MDM2-, p21-) was statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.0024). This anomalous p53+, MDM2-, p21- phenotype was also found in a small group of five cases with wt p53; this could indicate that in these cases p53 transactivation capacity has been abrogated by a mechanism other than p53 mutation. Most cases with the wt p53 gene show simultaneous immunohistochemical expression of all three proteins and often display higher levels than those found in reactive lymphoid tissue. There is a tendency for EBV-positive cases to harbour high levels of p53+ and p21+, suggesting that EBV could be involved in the nuclear accumulation of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 in NHL",

No p53 mutation was identified in any of the other 20 available bone marrow samples obtained at diagnosis. No correlation between the p53 status and clinical outcome could be determined.

We investigated clonality and genetic progression using p53 mutations as marker. Sampling was done through microdissection of frozen immunohistochemically stained 16 microm slices of tumors. From 11 BCC tumors 78 samples were analysed. Direct DNA sequencing of exons 5-8 was performed, haplotypes were determined after cloning of p53 exons and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) ascertained by microsatellite analysis. All tumors had p53 mutations and in a majority both p53 alleles were affected, commonly through missense mutations. Microdissection of small parts (50-100 cells) of individual tumors showed BCC to be composed of a dominant cell clone and prone to genetic progression with appearance of subclones with a second and even third p53 mutation. Samples from normal immunohistochemically negative epidermis always showed wild type sequence, except for a case of previously unknown germline p53 mutation. Our analysis also included p53 immunoreactive patches i.e. morphologically normal epidermis with a compact pattern of p53 immunoreactivity. Mutations within those were never the same as in the adjacent BCC. This detailed study of only one gene thus uncovered a remarkable heterogeneity within a tumor category famous for its benign clinical behavior",

    "Title": "Expression of the mutated p53 tumor suppressor protein and its molecular and biochemical characterization in multidrug resistant MCF- 7/Adr human breast cancer cells",
    "Abstract": "Multidrug resistance in MCF-7/Adr human breast cancer cells is mediated by several mechanisms including overexpression of the MDR1 gene product, P-glycoprotein and glutathione-related detoxifying enzymes. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor protein have been reported to play a role in the development of resistance to DNA damaging agents in several human cancer cells. In the present study we have assessed the mutational status of the p53 protein and its expression levels, degree of stability and cellular localization to investigate whether it is involved in modulating multidrug resistance in MCF-7/Adr cells compared to sensitive MCF-7 cells. As revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-p53 mouse monoclonal antibody DO-1, wild-type p53 is sequestered in the cytoplasm of MCF-7 cells, whereas in MCF-7/Adr cells, the protein is localized in the nucleus. The sequencing of full- length p53 cDNA revealed a 21 bp deletion in its one of the four conserved regions within the conformational domain, spanning codons 126- 133 at exon five, in MCF-7/Adr cells. Moreover, detection of ThaI polymorphism of codon 72 showed that MCF-7 cells predominantly express wild-type p53 with proline, while mutated p53 in MCF-7/Adr cells contains an arginine residue at codon 72. In addition, we demonstrate that the half-life of p53 in MCF-7 cells is less than 30 min while the mutated protein is more stable; its half-life is about 4 h in MCF-7/Adr cells. Thus, this study demonstrates that the deletion of codons 126- 133 in p53 causes increased stability, overexpression and nuclear localization of the protein in multidrug resistant MCF-7/Adr cells, and further suggests that mutated p53 might be involved in the development of multidrug resistance in this cell line",

    "Title": "Field cancerisation and polyclonal p53 mutation in the upper aero- digestive tract",
    "Abstract": "Field cancerisation of the aerodigestive tract is caused by chronic exposure to alcohol and tobacco, but the nature of the genetic alterations preceding overt malignancy is unknown. To identify potential field changes we have used a functional assay which tests the transcriptional competence of human p53 expressed in yeast. To increase the sensitivity and reliability of the technique for samples containing under 20% mutant p53, the 5' and 3'-ends of the p53 cDNA were examined separately. With this split form of the assay the tissue p53 mRNA acts as its own control for RNA quality. Mutations were detected in 87% (46/53) of tumours, reflecting the high sensitivity of the technique. Multiple biopsies of histologically normal tissue from the upper aero- digestive tract were tested and clonal p53 mutations were identified in 76% (38/50) of biopsies from patients presenting with multiple tumours compared with 32% (38/117) of biopsies from patients presenting with single tumours (P<0.000001). All patients (16/16) presenting with multiple tumours had at least one positive biopsy, compared with only 53% (19/36) of patients presenting with single tumours (P <0.001). This defines expansion of multiple clones of mutant p53-containing cells as an important biological mechanism of field cancerisation, and provides a means to identify patients likely to benefit from intensive screening for the development of new head and neck tumours",

    "Title": "TP53 mutational pattern in Spanish and Polish non-small cell lung cancer patients: null mutations are associated with poor prognosis",
    "Abstract": "Inactivation of TP53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequent molecular alteration in NSCLC, involving up to 60% of cases. Furthermore, TP53 mutational spectrum is related to the type of mutagen exposure, as well as racial and/or diet differences. Nearly 95% of TP53 perturbations affect codons included within exons 5-8 which encode for almost the entire DNA-binding domain. In this study we addressed the possible prognostic value of the molecular alterations identified in exons 5-8 of the TP53 gene in DNAs from 151 paraffin-embedded NSCLC sections corresponding to 59 Spanish and 92 Polish stage I-IIIA resected patients. PCR/single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis revealed that the occurrence of TP53 exon 5-8 mutations was 17/59 (29%) in the Spanish cohort and 17/92 (18%) in the Polish group. However, when DNA sequencing analysis was performed, these frequencies were reduced because of the presence of SSCP-false positive, intronic and silent mutations and polymorphisms. Fifteen of the 59 Spanish NSCLC tumors (25%) harbored TP53 mutations affecting exons 5-8 coding sequences, whereas only 12 of 92 Polish neoplasms (13%) contained alterations in the central hydrophobic region of p53. Our results indicate that the occurrence of TP53 mutations affecting exon 5-8 coding sequences in some European NSCLC populations may be lower than previously reported, and that the TP53 mutational patterns of these cohorts differ somewhat. The Spanish NSCLC patients contained missense mutations (9/59, 15%) and a relatively high percentage of null mutations (5/59, 8%) while the Polish patients mostly harbored missense mutations (9/92, 10%) and only one tumor contained a null type (1/92, 1%). Moreover, most TP53 missense mutations in the Spanish group were located outside the conserved regions, whereas the same mutations in the Polish group affected conserved amino acids. Furthermore, the Polish patients harbored a high percentage of G-->A transitions (most of them at non-CpG sites), while G-->T transversions were predominant in the Spanish group. Our findings suggest that there may be different racial or exogenous factors in these two populations which may help to explain both the distinct TP53 mutational pattern and the lower frequency obtained in the Polish group. The presence of missense mutations did not confer a worse clinical outcome in these subsets of NSCLC patients. However, patients whose tumors contained null TP53 gene mutations had a 5 month median disease-free survival time in contrast with 42 months in those patients without mutations (P=0.008). These findings suggest that loss of p53 function may enhance tumor progression in NSCLC patients independently of whether dominant negative TP53 missense mutations are present",

    "Title": "High frequency of p53 mutations in human oral epithelial dysplasia and primary squamous cell carcinoma detected by yeast functional assay",
    "Abstract": "To determine the timing and actual incidence of p53 mutations in oral epithelial lesions, we examined 33 primary squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), 14 dysplasias and six hyperplasias from Japanese patients by a combination of yeast functional assay and DNA sequencing. The assay detects mutations of p53 mRNA between codons 67 and 347 on the basis of the DNA-binding activity of the protein. Twenty-six SCCs (79%) and five dysplasias (36%) were positive for p53 mutation, while all six hyperplasias were negative for the mutation. Human papillomavirus type 16 E6 mRNA was detected in one of seven p53 mutation-negative SCCs by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We further examined p53 mutations in 17 Sri Lankan oral SCCs using the yeast functional assay and the single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified DNA fragments (PCR-SSCP) of exon 5-8. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing and the detection sensitivity was compared between the two methods. Six samples (35%) were positive for p53 mutation in PCR-SSCP analysis, while nine samples (53%) were positive in yeast functional assay. This suggests that the incidence of p53 mutations has been considerably underestimated in the conventional SSCP analysis. The present data indicate that p53 mutations are extremely frequent in oral cancers in the Japanese, and suggest that the timing and significance of p53 mutation in oral tumor progression vary in different ethnic populations and areas",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in p53 were detected in 11/23 (48%) of non melanoma skin cancers in renal allograft recipients and in 5/8 (63%) of sporadic tumours from immune competent patients. 9/12 (75%) of mutations in transplant patients and all 5 mutations in non transplant tumours were consistent with damage caused by ultraviolet (u.v.) irradiation. DNA sequences, predominantly of the epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) subgroup, were detected in 9/23 (39%) of transplant tumours and in 2/8 (25%) of eight non-transplant tumours. There was no relationship between HPV status and p53 mutation, HPV DNA being present in 5/16 (31%) of tumours with p53 mutation and 6/15 (40%) of tumours lacking p53 mutation. These data are consistent with an important role for sunlight in the development of post-transplant skin cancer, and with limited functional data suggesting that E6 proteins of the cutaneous and EV-related papillomaviruses do not target p53 for ubiquitin- mediated degradation",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: We assessed the frequency and molecular basis of p53 mutations in clinically localized prostatic adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Prostate specimens were examined from 100 patients with clinically localized prostatic adenocarcinoma and 13 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Mutations producing nuclear accumulation of p53 were detected immunohistochemically. Exon-specific mutations were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and sequenced. RESULTS: p53 accumulation was detected in 5 tumors using antibody DO-1, and in 4 of these using antibody PAb 1801, but not in BPH. PCR-SSCP detected mutations in all 5 tumors, with alterations in exon 5 for 1 tumor, exon 6 for 3 tumors, and exon 7 for 1 tumor. An exon 6 mutation was also found in a tumor with no anti-p53 staining. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations are uncommon in clinically localized prostatic adenocarcinoma and absent from BPH. 5 of the 6 mutations were derived from locally invasive, prostate carcinomas, supporting the hypothesis that mutation of p53 is a late event in prostate carcinoma progression",

    "Abstract": "We present a simple nonradioactive assay based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in combination with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), which allows comprehensive mutation scanning of the entire coding sequence and splice junctions of the p53 gene in one analytical step. The key features of the present method are (1) all fragments can be amplified using one common PCR protocol; (2) all fragments can be scanned for mutations on a single 'broad-range' denaturing gradient gel; and (3) all fragments were tailored by the attachment of appropriate GC clamps and otherwise manipulated to consist of only two melting domains in order to maximize resolution of mutations by DGGE. The entire procedure starting with a sample of genomic DNA can be completed within 6 hr and has the potential to detect any sequence variation, irrespective of its location in the p53 gene. The mutation detection sensitivity was demonstrated by the analysis of 26 constructed control mutations distributed over the whole of the p53 gene. We have applied the method to genetic diagnosis in 43 cases of colorectal cancer. Overall, a point mutation, microdeletion, or microinsertion was found in 26 (61%) of the tumors. In addition to missense and frameshift mutations within exons 4-8, a 20-bp insertion in exon 11 was found in one sample, illustrating the importance of comprehensive gene scanning for reliable diagnosis",

    "Abstract": "We present changes in the p53 gene in a group of 70 thyroid tumours and 40 blood samples obtained from children from Belarus. Three thyroid tumours show a polymorphism in exon 6 (codon 213) and 5 tumours show a polymorphism in intron 6, 37 bp upstream to the 5'-end of exon 7. Only one patient has a mutation in exon 7 (codon 258) resulting in an amino acid substitution in the protein p53. The distribution of polymorphisms in the 40 blood samples was as follows: three patients had a polymorphism in exon 6 and two persons had a polymorphism in intron 6. One polymorphism in intron 6 was also found in the group of 30 healthy children from Belarus. The fact that the differences in the sequence in p53 found in the tumours was also seen in the blood of these patients demonstrates that they are polymorphisms not induced by radiation exposure. It is difficult to conclude, if the polymorphisms found by us could be associated with the predisposition to radiation-induced cancer",

    "Title": "Human papillomavirus infection and TP53 gene mutation in primary cervical carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Tumor specimens obtained from 136 patients with primary carcinoma of the uterine cervix were analyzed for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) sequences and for mutation of the TP53 gene. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that 130 of 136 (96%) tumors contained an oncogenic HPV 16 or 18 sequence. HPV 16 was the predominant type in cervical squamous cell carcinomas and HPV 18 was significantly associated with cervical adenocarcinomas (p < 0.05). The more dedifferentiated the primary tumor, the more frequent the HPV 16 infection and the more differentiated, the more frequent the HPV 18 infection (p < 0.05). Two out of 136 (1.5%) tumors demonstrated single- strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) band shifts. One (positive for HPV 18) had a nonsense mutation of codon 101 in exon 4 from AAA to TAA transversion. Another (positive for L1 consensus primer set) showed a point mutation involving codon 179 in exon 5 changing CAT to CGT transition. The three specimens negative for HPV did not contain TP53 gene mutations. Our data show that mutation of TP53 is infrequent in primary cervical carcinoma and there is no inverse correlation between HPV infection and TP53 gene mutation. Other mechanisms independent of TP53 inactivation may also be implicated in tumorigenesis of the uterine cervix",

    "Title": "The relationship between TP53 mutations and overexpression of p53 and prognosis in malignant gliomas of childhood",
    "Abstract": "The prognosis for children with high-grade gliomas remains somewhat unpredictable. Although prolonged disease control is sometimes achieved after surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, most patients exhibit rapid disease progression. Because p53-dependent apoptosis mechanisms are involved in the cytotoxic effects of irradiation and chemotherapy, we questioned whether p53 status might be associated with outcome in childhood malignant gliomas. Therefore, we examined p53 status, both immunohistochemically and by direct sequencing of exons 5-8, in a series of 29 archival pediatric malignant non-brainstem gliomas treated consecutively at our institution between 1975 and 1992. Eighteen tumors had dense p53 staining in the majority of cells, although only 11 had mutations of the p53 gene (TP53). On univariate analysis, there was a significant association between p53 overexpression and a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS; P = 0.019 and 0.013, respectively; rank sum test). In addition, there was a significant association between TP53 mutations and a poorer PFS (P = 0.04), and a strong trend toward a shorter OS among patients with TP53 mutations (P = 0.06). Median PFS and OS for patients with TP53-mutated tumors were 6 months and 16 months, respectively, and for those with p53 overexpression 5.5 months and 14 months, respectively, versus 16 months and 25 months, respectively, for those without TP53 mutations and 25 months and >4 years, respectively, for those without p53 overexpression. The percentage of patients in this series with TP53 mutations (37.9%) was substantially higher than in previous studies of childhood gliomas and comparable to the frequency of mutations noted in adult gliomas. However, both TP53 mutation and p53 overexpression were significantly less frequent in tumors from children younger than 4 than from older children (P = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). These results indicate that p53 mutation and expression status may be associated with prognosis in childhood malignant gliomas, and thus may provide a basis for stratifying patients biologically in future malignant glioma studies",

    "Title": "Integrity of p53 in hepatitis B x antigen-positive and -negative hepatocellular carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 seems to be important to the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Although this inactivation may be due to mutations in the p53 gene, recent evidence suggests that the hepatitis B virus-encoded X antigen (HBxAg) binds to and inactivates wild-type p53. Hence, experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that there is a low frequency of p53 mutations in HBxAg-positive HCC. HBxAg and p53 were assayed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in HCC and nontumor liver from 16 Chinese patients, half of whom were hepatitis B surface antigen carriers. HBxAg was detectable in tumor and/or nontumor cells from all patients by IHC; six of these samples also had detectable p53. To determine whether p53 detection by IHC, and hence stabilization, is associated with mutation, sequencing of p53 exons 5-8 was performed with each patient sample. Wild-type sequences were found in 13 of 16 HBxAg-positive cases (81%). Hence, HBxAg is a common marker of HCC that correlates with the persistence of wild-type p53 among both carriers and noncarriers. The low frequency of p53 mutations in HCC in these patients implies that p53 inactivation may occur predominantly by complex formation with HBxAg",

    "Title": "Tumor-suppressive pathways in pancreatic carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "During tumorigenesis, positive selection is exerted upon those tumor cells that alter rate-limiting regulatory pathways. A corollary of this principle is that mutation of one gene abrogates the need for alteration of another gene in the same pathway and also that the coexistence in a single tumor of mutations in different genes implies their involvement in distinct tumor-suppressive pathways. We studied 42 pancreatic adenocarcinomas for genetic alterations in the K-ras oncogene and the p16, p53, and DPC4 tumor suppressor genes. All of them had the K-ras gene mutated. Thirty-eight % of the tumors had four altered genes, another 38% had three altered genes, 15% had two altered genes, and 8% of the tumors had one altered gene. Interestingly, we noted a high concordance of DPC4 and p16 inactivations (P = 0.007), suggesting that the genetic inactivation of p16 increases the selective advantage of subsequent mutation in DPC4. No statistically significant association was identified between the alteration of these cancer genes and pathological or clinical parameters. This type of multigenic analysis in human tumors may serve to substantiate experimental tumor models and thus increase our understanding of the truly physiologically relevant tumor-suppressive pathways that are abrogated during human tumorigenesis",

To test this hypothesis, 78 tumors were analyzed for p53 mutations with SSCP analysis of the entire open reading frame. At the same time, alterations in 10 microsatellite loci including di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats were evaluated. Fourteen (26%) of all mutations were insertion/deletion mutations. All insertion/deletion mutations were associated with one of the following features: runs of purines or pyrimidines, repeats of short sequences, or palindromes. There was a strong association of generalized microsatellite instability with p53 in contrast to tumors with other types of mutations or wild-type p53 (P = 0.007). These characteristic p53 mutations appear to be caused by generalized genomic instability rather than to be the direct cause of genomic instability.

    "Title": "p53 mutations, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and aflatoxin exposure in hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan",
    "Abstract": "Recent studies have implicated aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) exposure as an etiological agent in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and suggested an interaction with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Worldwide AFB1 exposure correlates with a specific mutation at codon 249 in the p53 tumor suppressor gene in liver tumors. This study investigated the roles of HBV and AFB1 in the HCC carcinogenic pathway involving p53 mutations. In cases and controls, chronic HBV infection was assessed by serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and AFB1 exposure by immunohistochemical detection of AFB1-DNA adduct in liver tissue. p53 protein mutations in tumor tissues of HCC cases were identified by immunohistochemistry and DNA mutations by single-stranded conformational polymorphism and sequencing analysis. Both chronic HBsAg carrier status and liver AFB1-DNA adducts were significantly higher in cases than in controls with odds ratios (OR) of 8.4 and 3.9, respectively (P < 0.01). Moreover, HCC risk was greatest in individuals with both AFB1-DNA adducts and HBsAg, suggesting a viral-chemical interaction. Mutant p53 protein, mutations in the p53 gene, and specific codon 249 mutations were detected in 37, 29, and 13%, respectively, of the HCC cases. Most of the DNA mutations were transversions, and the only major clustering site for mutations was codon 249. AFB1-DNA adducts were associated with p53 protein (OR = 2.9, P = 0.054) and DNA mutations (OR = 2.9, P = 0.082) but with borderline significance. All of the codon 249 mutations (n = 12) occurred in HBsAg-seropositive carriers, resulting in an OR of 10.0 (P < 0.05), suggesting that HBV may be involved in the selection of these mutations. The ORs between HBsAg and p53 DNA and protein mutations were 2.6 (P = 0.077) and 1.8 (P > 0.05), respectively. Both p53 DNA and protein mutations were related to tumor stage, suggesting that they are late events. These studies provided further support for the role of aflatoxin exposure in HCC in Taiwan and insight into viral-chemical interactions and molecular pathogenesis",

    "Title": "Characterization of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway in cell lines of the National Cancer Institute anticancer drug screen and correlations with the growth-inhibitory potency of 123 anticancer agents",
    "Abstract": "In the present study, we report the characterization of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway in the 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) anticancer drug screen, as well as correlations between the integrity of this pathway and the growth-inhibitory potency of 123 anticancer agents in this screen. Assessment of p53 status in these lines was achieved through complete p53 cDNA sequencing, measurement of basal p53 protein levels and functional assessment of (a) transcriptional activity of p53 cDNA from each line in a yeast assay, (b) gamma-ray-induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and (c) gamma-ray-induced expression of CIP1/WAF1, GADD45, and MDM2 mRNA. Our investigations revealed that p53 gene mutations were common in the NCI cell screen lines: 39 of 58 cell lines analyzed contained a mutant p53 sequence. cDNA derived from almost all of the mutant p53 cell lines failed to transcriptionally activate a reporter gene in yeast, and the majority of mutant p53 lines studied expressed elevated basal levels of the mutant p53 protein. In contrast to most of the wild-type p53-containing lines, cells containing mutant p53 sequence were also deficient in gamma-ray induction of CIP1/WAF1, GADD45, and MDM2 mRNA and the ability to arrest in G1 following gamma-irradiation. Taken together, these assessments provided indications of the integrity of the p53 pathway in the 60 cell lines of the NCI cell screen. These individual p53 assessments were subsequently used to probe a database of growth-inhibitory potency for 123 &quot;standard agents,&quot; which included the majority of clinically approved anticancer drugs. These 123 agents have been tested against these lines on multiple occasions, and a proposed mechanism of drug action had previously been assigned to each agent. Our analysis revealed that cells with mutant p53 sequence tended to exhibit less growth inhibition in this screen than the wild-type p53 cell lines when treated with the majority of clinically used anticancer agents: including DNA cross-linking agents, antimetabolites, and topoisomerase I and II inhibitors. Similar correlations were uncovered when we probed this database using most of the other indices of p53 status we assessed in the lines. Interestingly, a class of agents that differed in this respect was the antimitotic agents. Growth-inhibitory activity of these agents tended, in this assay, to be independent of p53 status. Our characterization of the p53 pathway in the NCI cell screen lines should prove useful to researchers investigating fundamental aspects of p53 biology and pharmacology. This information also allows for the large-scale analysis of the more than 60,000 compounds tested against these lines for novel agents that might exploit defective p53 function as a means of preferential toxicity",

    "Title": "Genetic evidence for the multicentric origin of synchronous multiple gastric carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Multiple gastric cancers, which constitute 4% to 10% of all gastric cancers, occur in older people and are associated with more extensive intestinal metaplasia. With regard to the genesis of multiple gastric cancers, multicentricity (independent origin) rather than multifocality (local or lateral spread of one cancer) has been the favored theory. Conventional morphologic study, however, has not been able to provide convincing evidence in support of multicentricity. The purpose of this study was to verify the multicentric origin of multiple gastric cancers at a genetic level. For this purpose, immunohistochemical and molecular techniques were used to define the mutation pattern of APC, MCC and p53 in multiple lesions of synchronous multiple gastric cancers. The study was based on a total of 30 gastric tumors from 13 patients, including 10 double tumors, 2 triple tumors, and 1 quadruple tumor. Single-strand conformation polymorphism and polymerase chain reaction direct sequencing were carried out for exons 5 to 8 of p53, and loss of heterozygosity was detected on the basis of polymerase chain reaction amplification of polymorphism in exon 10 of MCC and in exon 11 of APC. Twelve of 13 cases showed alteration in one or more genetic markers. Of these, three demonstrated a discordant mutation pattern of p53 in individual lesions, and another two revealed allelic loss of MCC in one lesion and p53 mutation in the other. In six other cases, only one lesion showed alteration of APC, MCC, or p53, and in the remaining case, one lesion carried p53 and MCC mutations and the other carried MCC loss of heterozygosity only. The results of this study showed discordance of the mutation pattern of APC, MCC, and p53 in individual lesions of multiple gastric cancers, providing genetic evidence for a multicentric origin of synchronous multiple gastric carcinomas. Collectively, these findings supported the theory of field cancerization in gastric carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Alterations of the p53 gene in occupational bladder cancer in workers exposed to aromatic amines",
    "Abstract": "Epidemiologic studies have revealed an increased risk for development of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) among dye workers/painters occupationally exposed to aromatic amines such as benzidine, beta- naphthylamine, orthotoluidine, and aniline. In the present study, p53 gene mutations in 26 patients with bladder lesions occupationally exposed to aromatic amines were examined by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified DNA segments, followed by direct sequencing. All were male, and age at admission ranged from 43 to 75 (median 66) years. Twenty-nine biopsy specimens were from primary lesions; 17 (61%) of these lesions were from TCC including one carcinoma in situ (CIS); 11 were from dysplasia; and 1 was taken from normal-looking transitional epithelium adjoining TCC. TCC lesions included 12 with low-grade (Grade 1 or 2) and 5 with high-grade (Grade 3 or CIS) changes. Twenty-four recurrent lesions were biopsied in 16 patients: TCC was found in 12 lesions (50%), CIS in 1 (4%), and dysplasia in 11 (46%). All lesions were localized within the submucosa except for two, which invaded into the muscle layers. PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis demonstrated that mutations (a) occurred in both dysplasia and in normal-looking epithelium, in addition to TCC lesions; (b) were at different sites in the p53 gene in concurrent or metachronous lesions; and (c) occurred in exon 5 in approximately 70% of lesions, especially at codons 151 and 152. C to T transitions were predominantly seen. These findings clearly show differences in the pattern of p53 mutation in occupational versus nonoccupational bladder lesions. Because both common and unique point mutations were found in p53 in concurrent and metachronous lesions, our results suggest that the multifocality of occupational bladder cancer arises both from multiple clonal lesions (field change) and from the dissemination of a single clone",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in multiple urothelial carcinomas: a molecular analysis of the development of multiple carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to assess whether the development of synchronous and/or metachronous multifocal urothelial cancers is due to field defect, intraluminal seeding and implantation, or both. We used a series of 42 cases of multiple urothelial cancers. We performed polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism, DNA sequencing, and immunohistochemical studies on p53 gene mutations in 84 multiple urothelial carcinomas (78 urinary bladder carcinomas and 6 ureteric or renal pelvic carcinomas) from 42 patients. p53 Mutations were detected in 42 (50%) of 84 cancerous tumors from 22 (52%) of the 42 patients and were strongly related to the tumor grade but not to the tumor stage. Nine patients had identical mutations with or without additional mutations in the multiple carcinomas, which suggests that the carcinomas had a common origin. Eleven patients, however, had discordant mutations, and two patients had a mutation in one tumor but not in another, a fact that strongly suggests independent origin. Double mutations were observed in 9 (21%) of 42 patients; in these types of mutation, transitions were clearly more frequent than transversions, a difference from previously reported spectra of urothelial carcinomas. The data indicate that multiple urothelial carcinomas seem to be either common or of independent origin. In addition, the different p53 mutational spectra in this series might reflect the presence of other possible mutagens in carcinogenesis of multiple urothelial carcinomas",

The contribution of genotypes related to carcinogen metabolism (CYP1A1 and GSTM1) was also analysed. p53 mutations were observed in 13 cases (37.5%). Seven (53.8%) of the 13 patients with p53 mutation compared with five (22.7%) of 22 patients without had a family history of cancer. However, there was no significant relation between p53 mutation or family history of cancer and CYP1A1 or GSTM1 genotypes. In conclusion, p53 mutation might be associated with the inherited characteristics that result in familial aggregation of lung cancer; however, this association was not explained by genotypes of enzymes related to carcinogen metabolisms",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations are common in uterine serous carcinoma and occur early in their pathogenesis",
    "Abstract": "Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is an uncommon but aggressive type of endometrial cancer associated with rapid progression of disease and a poor prognosis. Both USC and its recently described putative precursor, endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (EIC), demonstrate strong p53 overexpression by immunohistochemistry, suggesting alteration of the p53 gene in their pathogenesis. In the present study, we evaluated 21 USCs and 9 EICs for mutations in the p53 gene using direct sequence analysis and found that 90% of USCs and 78% of EICs contain mutations. Significantly, mutations were found in 3 cases of EIC without associated invasive carcinoma and identical mutations were detected in cases with synchronous USC and EIC. Strong p53 immunoreactivity was seen in the majority of USCs and EICs and correlated with p53 gene mutation, although lack of reactivity did not always indicate the absence of a gene mutation. Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 17p was observed in 100% of USCs and in 43% of EICs, demonstrating that loss of the wild-type p53 allele occurs early in the development of serous carcinoma. Overall, our results reveal that p53 mutations are very common in USC and EIC. The presence of p53 gene mutations in EIC further suggests that p53 alteration plays an important role early in the pathogenesis of serous carcinoma, possibly accounting for its aggressive biological behavior",

    "Title": "Molecular genetic analysis of giant cell glioblastomas",
    "Abstract": "Glioblastomas (GBMs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors. Recently, distinct molecular genetic alterations have been linked to subgroups of patients with GBM. Giant cell (gc)GBMs are a rare variant of GBM characterized by a marked preponderance of multinucleated giant cells. Several reports have associated this entity with a more favorable prognosis than the majority of GBMs. To evaluate whether gcGBM may also represent a genetically defined subgroup of GBM, we analyzed a series of 19 gcGBMs for mutations in the TP53 gene for amplification of the EGFR and CDK4 genes and for homozygous deletions in the CDKN2A (p16/MTS1) gene. Seventeen of nineteen gcGBMs carried TP53 mutations whereas EGFR and CDK4 gene amplification was seen in only one tumor each and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A was not observed at all. The strikingly high incidence of TP53 mutations and the relative absence of other genetic alterations groups gcGBM together with a previously recognized molecular genetic variant of GBM (type 1 GBM). It is tempting to speculate that the better prognosis of gcGBM patients may result from the low incidence of EGFR amplification and CDKN2A deletion, changes known for their growth-promoting potential",

    "Title": "Benign clonal keratinocyte patches with p53 mutations show no genetic link to synchronous squamous cell precancer or cancer in human skin",
    "Abstract": "Ultraviolet light, which is the major etiology of human skin cancer, will cause mutations in the p53 gene. We and others have found that such mutations occur in more than one-half of non-melanoma squamous cell cancer and precancer. Immunostaining for p53 has disclosed a characteristic compact pattern not only in cancer/precancer but also in areas of microscopically normal epidermis termed p53 patches. By microdissection, sequence analysis of the p53 gene, and analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the site of this gene, we have now extended previous data to ascertain whether these p53 patches are precursors of simultaneously present squamous cell cancer or its morphologically recognized precancerous stages (dysplasia, carcinoma in situ). In none of 11 instances with co-existence of a p53 patch with dysplasia or in situ or invasive cancer were the mutations identical. We conclude that p53 patches, estimated to be approximately 100,000 times as common as dysplasia, have a very small or even no precancerous potential. Their common presence demonstrates that human epidermis contains a large number of p53 mutations apparently without detrimental effect. The only result of the mutation may be a clandestine benign clonal keratinocyte proliferation. The importance of p53 mutations for such benign cell multiplication on one band and malignant transformation on the other is unclear. Although the spectrum, type, and multiplicity of mutations were similar in both types of proliferative responses, there was a clear difference with respect to LOH. No LOH was found in 17 p53 patches. By contrast 11 of 30 precancers/cancers had LOH",

    "Title": "p53 gene aberrations in non-small-cell lung carcinomas from a smoking population",
    "Abstract": "We examined 46 non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) for the presence of p53 mutations in exons 4-9, positive p53 immunostaining and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the TP53 locus. p53 mutations were detected in 13 tumour samples (28.3%), whereas overexpression of the p53 protein was found in 30 of 45 (67%) samples. Allelic loss was found in 9 of 38 (23.6%) informative cases. The statistical analysis revealed no significant correlation between p53 mutations and clinicopathological data, although mutations appear to occur more frequently in squamous cell carcinomas (7 of 18) than in adenocarcinomas (2 of 15). All but three individuals in this study group smoked. In contrast to previous reports, we found a higher prevalence of GC-->AT transitions than of GC- ->TA transversions, as expected in a smoking population. A trend was found between p53-positive immunostaining and a history of heavy smoking (76-126 pack-years) and was inversely correlated with allelic deletion (LOH) at the TP53 locus. Eight of the 12 NSCLCs containing p53 mutations also had concomitant p53 overexpression, and it is of specific note that three of the four tumours containing p53 'mutations' with no overexpression of the p53 protein had either insertions or deletions in the p53 gene. No correlation was found between p53 mutations and fractional allele loss or ras mutations. p53 mutations in this Merseyside population in the UK do not appear to be as common as in other reports for NSCLC and exhibit predominance of GC-->AT transitions preferentially at non-CpG sites, suggesting that other carcinogens in addition to those in tobacco smoke may be involved in NSCLC in the Merseyside area of the UK",

    "Abstract": "We analysed the frequency of p53 mRNA overexpression in a series of 109 primary colorectal carcinomas and its association with p53 gene mutation, which has been correlated with short survival. Sixty-nine of the 109 cases (63%) demonstrated p53 mRNA overexpression, without any correlation with stage or site of disease. Comparison with p53 gene mutation indicated that, besides cases in which p53 gene mutation and p53 mRNA overexpression were either both present (40 cases) or both absent (36 cases), there were also cases in which p53 mRNA was overexpressed in the absence of any mutation (29 cases) and those with a mutant gene in which the mRNA was not overexpressed (four cases). Moreover, the mutant p53 tumours exhibited an increase of p53 mRNA expression, which was significantly higher in tumours expressing the mutated allele alone than in tumours expressing both wild- and mutated- type alleles. These data (1) show that p53 mRNA overexpression is a frequent event in colorectal tumours and is not predictive of the status of the gene, i.e. whether or not a mutation is present; (2) provide further evidence that p53 protein overexpression does not only result from an increase in the half-life of mutated p53 and suggest that inactivation of the p53 function in colorectal cancers involves at least two distinct mechanisms, including p53 overexpression and/or mutation; and (3) suggest that p53 mRNA overexpression is an early event, since it is not correlated with Dukes stage",

Although both tumours occasionally show invasive growth, they exhibit different clinical and biological findings. The oncogene and anti-oncogene in thymic epithelial tumours have not been evaluated fully. We investigated the expression of p53 protein by immunohistochemical analysis using the anti-p53 polyclonal antibody (CM- 1) in 17 thymomas and 19 thymic carcinomas. We also examined p53 gene (exon 5-8) mutation in 18 thymic carcinomas by using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism methods and direct sequencing. Of the thymoma cases, only one invasive thymoma showed focal nuclear staining. Fourteen of the 19 thymic carcinomas (74%) showed nuclear staining. Point mutations of the p53 gene were recognized in only 2 of the 18 thymic carcinomas (11%). One was the mutation C to T transition in the first letter of codon 222 in exon 6, which results in the amino acid substitution from proline to serine. Another was a silent mutation. p53 protein accumulation is highly frequent in thymic carcinomas but not in thymomas, and gene mutation is uncommon in thymic carcinomas",

Our purpose was to study the prognostic value of p53 alterations and to determine whether some specific mutation type in the p53 gene could be associated with poor clinical evolution in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. To this end, we studied 81 resected primary NSCLCs in order to detect p53 alterations. p53 protein accumulation was analysed using immunohistochemistry methods; p53 gene mutations in exons 5-9 were studied using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing techniques. p53 protein was immunodetected in 46.9% of lung carcinomas and 44.7% of p53-immunopositive tumours showed p53 mutations. Survival analysis was performed on 62 patients. No survival differences were found for patients with or without p53 immunopositivity. A shorter survival was found in patients with underlying p53 gene mutations, mainly in patients with squamous cell lung tumours; the worst prognosis was found when mutations were located in exon 5 (P = 0.007). In conclusion, the location of p53 mutations might be considered as a prognostic indicator for the evaluation of poor clinical evolution in NSCLC patients",

    "Abstract": "The incidence of colorectal carcinoma is rising at an alarming pace in Asian urban societies such as Hong Kong. Detailed examination of the epidemiological pattern and genetic mutation of colorectal cancer in the Hong Kong Chinese population is overdue. We compared the reported age incidence of colorectal carcinoma in Hong Kong with that of Scotland and other countries. Hong Kong showed a much higher incidence of colorectal carcinoma among the young age groups. By comparison with other countries, this raised incidence among the young appeared to be related to southern Chinese societies. The recent dramatic rise in colorectal cancer in Hong Kong was largely attributable to an increase in the over 50 years age group, while the young incidence remained unchanged. We also defined the mutation spectrum of p53 and Ki-ras in 67 unselected cases by direct DNA sequencing. Interestingly, insertion/deletion mutations in p53 from colorectal carcinoma in Hong Kong showed a significantly higher frequency (17.2%) than the Scottish data (0%) and the world database (6.6%), although the overall frequency of p53 mutation (43%) in Hong Kong was similar to others. The high incidence of colorectal carcinoma in young people and the raised proportion of frameshift mutations in p53 encourage further search for a genetic basis for susceptibility to this disease in the Hong Kong Chinese population",

    "Abstract": "It has been found by PCR-SSCP analysis and direct DNA sequencing that a human salivary adenosquamous carcinoma-forming cell line, TYS, has a mutant p53 gene at codon 281Asp-->His. When TYS cells were treated with a differentiation-inducing agent, vesnarinone, cellular proliferation was significantly inhibited on the basis of MTT assay. In addition, it has been found by Northern blotting and/or immunoblotting that expression of p21WAF1 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is up-regulated by treating TYS cells with vesnarinone. TGF-beta 1 alone also induced p21WAF1 expression in TYS cells. Moreover, it has been shown by ELISA that the treatment of TYS cells with vesnarinone results in the enhanced generation of latent TGF-beta 1. The expression of TGF- beta receptor (T beta R), including T beta R-I, T beta R-II and T beta R-III, on TYS cells was detected by affinity cross-linking using 125I- TGF-beta 1 and addition of active TGF-beta 1 into serum-free culture medium inhibited the growth of TYS cells in a concentration-dependent manner. These findings suggest that vesnarinone might directly induce expression of p21WAF1 gene in TYS cells, the product of which may be associated with the inhibition of cell growth and induce differentiation",

    "Abstract": "Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) are microscopic lesions which can be detected, after methylene blue staining, in the overtly normal looking colonic mucosa of cancer patients. ACF have been postulated to be precursor lesions which develop into colorectal cancer. Mutations of K- ras and p53 are two important genetic events implicated in colon carcinogenesis. Mutations in K-ras are detectable at earlier stages, while mutations in p53 are detectable at later stages of colon carcinogenesis. Our objective was to compare the nature of genetic alterations in K-ras (codon 12 and 13) and in p53 (exon 4-9) between ACF and corresponding colonic tumors from cancer patients. ACF with > or =20 crypts/focus were harvested from overtly normal looking colonic mucosa of cancer patients at a distance of (approx.) 5 cm from the site of colonic tumors. The colonic tumors and ACF samples were compared for K-ras codon 12 and 13 base pair sequence, using DNA sequencing and for p53 (exon 5-9) allelic types, using PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing. The results demonstrated a perfect correlation in terms of the type of K- ras allele (wild or mutated) between the ACF (> or =20 crypts/focus) and corresponding colonic tumors in 11/13 cancer patients. Analyses of p53 mutations demonstrated the presence of p53 mutations in colonic carcinomas from 10/13 patients. However, p53 mutations could be detected in an ACF from only 1/13 patient. The results provides further evidence to the role of ACF as precursor to colon cancer. The presence of an identical K-ras as well as p53 mutation in an ACF and the corresponding colonic carcinoma in a patient suggests the possibility of existence of ACF that may be at a more advanced stage in the sequence of colonic tumorigenesis than others. In conclusion, the results suggest that a subset of ACF with higher multiplicity might be considered more likely to progress to more advanced lesions and should be explored as markers of colon cancer risk",

These genes may be important in the development of nitrogen mustard (NM) drug resistance in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Using Western blot analysis, we examined the levels of Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-X and p53 protein expression and determined whether the levels of these proteins correlated with in vitro drug resistance in CLL patients' lymphocyte samples. Our investigations suggest that in CLL, NM drug resistance develops without any detectable alteration of Bcl-2, Bax or Bcl-X. In addition, we determined the presence of p53 mutations in 14 samples in order to assess if there is an association between in vitro drug resistance and the presence of p53 mutations. Using single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing analysis, we observed a p53 mutation in two out of seven resistant samples. The mutation occurring in both cases was a G:C --> A:T transition at codon 273 (exon 8). One of these cases was de novo resistant to the nitrogen mustards. Only one of six samples with acquired resistance to the nitrogen mustards had a p53 mutation suggesting that p53 mutations are not a prominent feature of acquired NM resistance in CLL",

    "Abstract": "Eleven non-invasive and 24 invasive transitional cell bladder cancers were analysed for molecular alterations to the p53 gene and nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein. 9% (1/11) of non-invasive rumours and 21% (5/24) of invasive tumours revealed nuclear accumulation in more than 50% of the tumour cells. PCR analysis of D17S30 showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in invasive tumours (3/24; 12%). Two invasive tumours harboured point mutations in exon 6 and exon 7, respectively (8%). Our results indicate that p53 protein overexpression correlates with tumour progression, p53 gene mutations and LOH detected by PCR.",

    "Title": "Analysis of K-ras, p53, bcl-2 and Rb expression in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Six non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (A-549, Ca-Lu-6, SK-Lu-1, Ca-Lu-1, SK-Mes-1 and LX-1) were studied to assess the presence of multiple concomitant alterations of different oncogenes (K-ras, bcl-2) and tumor suppressor genes (p53, Rb) in NSCLC. K-ras (exon 1) and p53 (exons 5-8) gene mutations were determined via a PCR-based-DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electro-phoresis) and by sequencing approach. Different mutations were found in the Ist exon of K-ras gene in 5 of 6 cell lines examined. Five of six cell lines contained K-ras mutations at codon 12 (A-549, SK-Lu-1, LX-1) or codon 13 (SK-Mes-1, Ca-Lu-1). In addition, 5 of 6 cell lines showed p53 mutations of exon 8 (SK-Mes-1, Ca-Lu-1 cod. 280; LX-1 cod. 273) or exon 6 (Ca-Lu-6 cod. 196; SK-Lu-1 cod. 193). In 4 of these cell lines, p53 protein nuclear expression was also confirmed with DO-7 mAb immunocytochemistry. Expression of cytoplasmic bcl-2 protein, by anti-bcl-2 mAb flow cytometric analysis, was found in A-549, Ca-Lu-1, SK-Lu-1, SK-Mes-1 cell lines. In contrast, RT-PCR analysis of Rb gene could not identify any change in the cell lines examined. In conclusion, most NSCLC cell lines tested displayed concomitant multiple oncogene/tumor suppressor gene alterations.",

    "Title": "Morphological and molecular characterization of an undifferentiated soft tissue sarcoma cell line and derivative clones",
    "Abstract": "From an undifferentiated soft tissue sarcoma (STS) a cell line designated US8-93 has been established. At subcloning the cell line US8-93 three different lines (US8-93A, B and C) could be set up. In a subsequent study characteristics for ultrastructure, growth, cell cycle distribution, karyotype, protein overexpression detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and p53 mutational status were determined. The cell line US8-93 as well as subclones contain mainly bipolar spindle-shaped cells and additionally some polygonal and multinucleated cells. Cells possess the characteristics of primitive mesenchymal cells based on their positive reactions with anti-vimentin and negative reactions for desmin, cytokeratin, myoglobin, S100, and NSE, implying a classification as an undifferentiated STS. Cytogenetic analysis revealed nearly diploid cells with several structural and numerical aberrations for chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15 and 18. IHC positivity was found for the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and Rb, the oncogene products Bcl-2, K-ras, N-ras, P-glycoprotein Mdr-1 and MDM-2. In the p53 gene a nonsense mutation in exon 4 was detected, that was confirmed in the original primary tumor and in three derivative clonal lines. The described STS cell line represents a valuable supplementation to the relatively small number of human STS cell lines currently available and may also provide a good in vitro model for studies of STS tumorigenesis in respect to a mutated p53 gene.",

    "Title": "Detection of BCL-6 rearrangements and p53 mutations in Malt-lymphomas",
    "Abstract": "Twenty-seven lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) derived from distinct anatomical sites were tested for the presence of genetic lesions commonly involved in B-cell lymphomagenesis, including activation of proto-oncogenes (BCL-1, BCL-2, BCL-6, and c-MYC), disruption of tumor suppressor loci (p53, 6q), and infection by viruses [Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Kaposi's sarcoma-herpesvirus/human herpesvirus-8 (KSHV/HHV-8)]. Sixteen low-grade and 11 high-grade MALT- lymphomas were included in the study. The presence of genetic lesions was tested by a combination of molecular approaches, including Southern blot hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism followed by DNA direct sequencing. Alterations of BCL-1, BCL-2, or c-MYC, as well as infection by KSHV/HHV- 8, scored negative in all MALT-lymphomas analysed. Conversely, rearrangements of BCL-6 and mutations of p53 clustered with a fraction of high-grade MALT-lymphomas. Deletions of 6q occurred in selected cases of both low- and high-grade MALT-lymphomas, whereas a monoclonal infection by EBV was restricted to one single patient. These data corroborate the notion that the molecular pathogenesis of MALT- lymphomas differs substantially from that of nodal B-cell lymphomas. Occasionally, however, a proportion of high-grade MALT-lymphomas may harbor selected genetic lesions among the ones commonly involved in nodal B-cell lymphomagenesis",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE:\n\nCheck on the sequence alterations of the p53 gene of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in some areas of Guangxi.\nMETHODS:\n\n40 cases of archival HCC samples were divided into two groups. One includes 26 cases from Fusui--an area notorious for high risk in HCC, AFB1 and HBV; The other includes 14 cases from Yulin where both HCC and HBV were high but AFB1 may be low because rice low in AFB1 was the staple food. Exon 7 were sequenced by DNA direct sequencing. p53 mutational protein and HBsAg were examined by immunostaing.\nRESULTS:\n\nIn the Fusui group, 16/26 (61.5%) cases showed mutation at codon 249 third position G to T transversion to form a hot-spot which is generally considered to be caused by AFB1. In the Yulin group, only one single place-Guigang showed p53 mutation clustered at the hot-spot like Fusui in 3/5 cases (60%), while the other cases demonstrated mutational points in various positions.\nCONCLUSION:\n\nBesides Qidong and South Africa, a third AFB1 high risk area was demonstrated where HCC is accompanied by p53 gene specific mutation.",

    "Abstract": "32 stage I cases of gallbladder carcinoma (GC) were examined to evaluate TP53 mutations with special attention to growth patterns. Their growth patterns were classified into two types: polypoid (P-type) and flat (F-type). 16 cases of GC were classified as P-type and 16 as F- type. p53 immunohistochemistry was performed using a mouse monoclonal anti-p53 antibody. Mutations in exons 5-8 were examined by polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing. The incidence of p53 immunoreactivity was greater in the cases of F-type (11/16, 69%) than those in P-type (14/16, 25%) (P < 0.05). PCR-SSCP or direct sequencing revealed that TP53 mutations were detected in all cases positive for p53 protein. These results suggest that TP53 mutations may contribute to the carcinogenesis of the F-type GC, and than this pathway in the F-type may differ from that in the P- type GC",

    "Title": "The status of p53 in the metastatic progression of colorectal cancer",
    "Abstract": "In order to investigate the role of TP53 in tumour progression and metastasis, we analysed 33 liver metastases of colorectal carcinomas and 19 primary colon carcinomas from the same hospital with respect to mutational changes, loss of heterozygosity and expression of the TP53 tumour suppressor gene. Direct sequencing of PCR products corresponding to the coding region of TP53 revealed that 13 of 19 primary tumours (68%) and 23 of 33 liver metastases (70%) had mutations in the TP53 gene. The distribution of mutations along the coding region of TP53 was similar in liver metastases compared to primary tumours. Thus, codon specificity did not seem to be a relevant factor and cells carrying specific TP53 mutations seem to have no selective advantage in the metastasising process. Comparing our data with the mutational spectra found in other countries did not reveal differences in the distribution of mutations along the coding region. Most of the metastases analysed showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH, 9 of 12 cases, 75%) and strong nuclear staining in immunohistochemistry (10 of 17 cases, 59%). Furthermore, with respect to mRNA expression levels, tumours carrying TP53 mutations showed significantly higher p53 mRNA levels compared to those without TP53 mutations. Thus, regulation of p53 mRNA levels seems to be subject to selection processes in tumourigenesis",

TP53 mutations were detected in eight tumours. Missense mutations predominated and all were transitions. Mutations were commonest in late- stage serous tumours. In three cases, where tissue was available, the mutations were homogeneous throughout several sections of the bilateral ovarian tumours and in omental metastases. These data confirm the findings of previous investigations describing TP53 mutation in ovarian carcinoma and demonstrate that archival paraffin-embedded tissues can be used for such analyses",

    "Title": "Ki-ras oncogene and p53 tumour suppressor gene mutations in colorectal carcinomas from the European Saar-Luxembourg region are less frequent than predicted by the classic adenoma-carcinoma sequence model",
    "Abstract": "Recent investigations of colorectal cancer (CRC) have suggested that the accumulation of specific alterations in cell-growth regulating genes trigger the stage-wise progression to malignancy and that at least some of them could be useful for prognosis. In this study, the frequency, location and type of mutations of the Ki-ras proto-oncogene exons 1-2 and p53 tumour-suppressor gene exons 5-9 were analysed in colorectal carcinomas of 72 patients from the European Saar-Luxembourg region using PCR-SSCP screening and direct sequencing. The incidences of Ki-ras activating and p53 inactivating point mutations in these European samples were much lower (Ki-ras: 5 (6.9%) and p53: 13 (18.1%)) than reported for both genes in American studies (40-50% at least) (P < 1 x 10(-3)). These results suggest that other genetic mechanisms than those proposed for the classic adenoma-carcinoma sequence model can frequently underlie CRC development and that Ki-ras and p53 mutations should not be considered as universal markers for CRC",

    "Title": "Mutations of the Ki-ras, p53 and APC genes in adenocarcinomas of the human small intestine",
    "Abstract": "In contrast to the origins of colorectal carcinomas, the mechanisms of carcinogenesis in the small intestine remain unclear. We therefore analyzed the mutational status of the Ki-ras, p53, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) genes in primary carcinomas of the small intestine and compared the mutation patterns with those established for colorectal cancers. DNA was extracted from 15 formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded lesions. Codons 12, 13 and 61 of the Ki-ras gene, exons 5-8 of the p53 gene, and codons 1268-1569, which contain the mutation cluster region (MCR) of the APC gene, were amplified by means of PCR, subcloned and sequenced. Mutations of the Ki-ras and p53 genes were observed in 8 (53.3%) and 4 lesions (26.7%), respectively. The mutational frequency of the Ki-ras gene in the present series of small intestinal carcinomas was similar, while that of the p53 gene was slightly lower than the reported frequencies for colorectal carcinomas. Only one case showed a mutation of the APC gene, involving an insertional mutation of an adenine at codons 1554-1556 with formation of a stop codon immediately downstream. Since the occurrence of an APC mutation is considered an early event in colorectal carcinogenesis, our findings indicating an extremely low frequency of such changes in and around the MCR suggest that carcinomas of the small intestine arise via a genetic pathway distinct from that involved in the development of carcinomas of the colorectum",

    "Title": "Conserved region mutations of the p53 gene are concentrated in distal colorectal cancers",
    "Abstract": "Distal colorectal cancers, especially those in the rectum, are more aggressive and more commonly recurrent than proximal cancers. We studied the possible relationship between p53-gene mutation type and location of the tumour, since mutations in the conserved areas of the p53 gene have been suggested to result in a poorer outcome of colorectal cancer than mutations outside these areas. Exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were studied in specimens from 72 colorectal-cancer patients. Polymerase-chain-reaction-amplified products of tumour DNA were analyzed by automated direct sequencing. Of the mutations detected in distal cancers, 71% were located in conserved regions of the gene, while only 42% of the mutations in proximal cancers were in these areas. In rectal cancers, 81% of the mutations were located in conserved regions. The tumours with mutations in the conserved regions were more often poorly differentiated (23%) than those with other mutations (0%). Our results indicate that mutations in the conserved regions of the p53 gene accumulate in distal but not in proximal tumours. This difference may be related to the more aggressive behaviour and to different aetiological factors associated with distal tumours",

    "Abstract": "Genetic instability related to defective DNA mismatch repair genes may be involved in the pathogenesis of carcinoma in Hereditary Non- Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC). To test that the targets of genetic instability could include critical transforming genes involved in colon tumor progression, we examined 23 colorectal carcinomas in patients with HNPCC in order to detect somatic mutations in K-ras and p53 genes. Using single strand conformation polymorphism followed by direct DNA sequencing, we detected 4 mutations in K-ras gene (17%) and 3 in p53 gene (13%) which change the amino acid sequence of the protein p53. This is significantly lower than in sporadic cancer. Our data suggest that colon cancer in HNPCC might partly involve a distinct pathogenetic mechanism that involves other genes than those altered in sporadic tumors",

    "Abstract": "Transgenic mice deficient for the p53 gene were reported to frequently develop angiosarcoma (AS), suggesting that alterations in the gene are associated with tumorigenesis of AS. However, little is known about genetic changes, including p53 gene alterations, in human AS because of its rarity. We analyzed p53 mutations on paraffin-embedded specimens from 33 patients with AS by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) followed by direct sequencing. Age of patients ranged from 18 to 91 (median 70) years, with a male to female ratio of 1.5:1. Sites of tumor were the head in 13 patients, the trunk in 4, the extremities in 4, the heart in 4, bones in 2 and others in 6. PCR-SSCP revealed aberrant mobility shifts of bands in 17 cases: 11 in exon 5, 5 in exon 7 and 4 in exon 8. Direct sequencing on these 17 cases revealed a total of 20 mutations. The frequency of p53 mutations was different by site of tumors: 7 of 13 in head, all 4 in extremities, 2 of 4 in heart and none of 4 in trunk. Our findings suggest that occurrence of p53 mutation is a major pathway for development of human AS",

    "Abstract": "The Japanese have a much lower incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) than Caucasians, presumably due in part to their skin type conferring relative protection from ultraviolet light radiation (UVR). To examine the contribution of environmental or endogenous mutagens other than UVR, which are expected to be relatively more important to the overall burden of NMSCs in the Japanese, we directly sequenced exons 5-8 of the p53 tumour suppressor gene in 29 Japanese patients with Bowen's disease, an in situ squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin. We found 9 mutations, including two CC:GG to TT:AA tandem transitions (presumably related to UVR), 3 transversions and 4 frameshift mutations. The mutational spectrum seen in our study contrasts with that we previously found in Bowen's disease from a Caucasian population, in keeping with a different aetiology for Bowen's disease in the respective populations. The unexpectedly high prevalence of frameshift mutations suggests that environmental mutagens other than UVR that preferentially induce deletion or insertion mutations may play an important role in the tumorigenesis of Japanese Bowen's disease, and warrants further investigation",

    "Abstract": "Alteration of the p53 gene is thought to be important in the early stages of human esophageal cancers, but how this confers a selective advantage to esophageal cancer cells is unknown. In this report, we analyzed 9 cell lines derived from human esophageal cancers (TE-1, TE- 3, TE-6, TE-7, TE-9, TE-10, TE-11, TE-13 and TE-15) for mutations in the p53 sequence, p53 protein expression and p53 protein DNA-binding activity. The cell lines could be grouped in 3 categories, including (1) cell lines with mis-sense mutations in the coding sequence and accumulation of mutant proteins (TE-1, TE-6, TE-10 and TE-11); (2) cell lines expressing truncated forms of p53 as a result of frameshift (TE- 9) or splice-site (TE-15) mutations; and (3) cell lines with wild-type p53 sequences but with impaired expression of p53 mRNA and protein, suggesting that p53 is inactivated by transcriptional repression (TE-3, TE-7 and TE-13). With the exception of TE-1, none of the cell lines exhibited p53-DNA-binding activity. In TE-1, a mutation at codon 272 (methionine to valine) generated a protein that retains basal DNA- binding activity, but that was not activated in response to DNA damage, suggesting that this mutation prevented p53 induction by genotoxic stress. Thus, p53 activity was impaired in all esophageal cell lines, including those containing wild-type p53 sequences",

    "Abstract": "As part of our ongoing studies to characterize molecular alterations in a well-defined series of surgically resected esophageal cancers, we examined the expression of 2 ras-regulated genes, whose products (osteopontin and cathepsin L) previously were shown to be associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. RNA was extracted from primary esophageal tumors (adenocarcinomas, 19; squamous-cell carcinomas, 6) and matched histologically normal esophageal mucosa from the distant resection margin. Northern analysis was used to quantitate RNA, relative to an 18S rRNA control, and immunohistochemistry to assess the tissue distribution of osteopontin. In addition, H-, K- and N-ras mutations were studied in the same tissues using PCR and hybridization with allele (mutant)-specific oligonucleotide probes. We demonstrated a K-ras mutation (codon 12, GTT) in one esophageal adenocarcinoma. The ras-regulated gene osteopontin was over-expressed in 100% of squamous- cell carcinomas and in 58% of adenocarcinomas relative to matched normal esophageal mucosa. Patterns of immunoreactivity for osteopontin protein also varied between squamous-cell carcinomas (tumor cell staining) and adenocarcinomas (predominantly tumor-infiltrating macrophages). Expression of cathepsin L also varied with esophageal tumor histology, with over-expression in 58% of primary esophageal adenocarcinomas and 33% of squamous-cell cancers",

    "Title": "Heterogeneous p53 mutations in a Burkitt lymphoma from an AIDS patient with monoclonal c-myc and VDJ rearrangements",
    "Abstract": "This study investigates the timing of p53 mutations detected in the malignant cells of a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (BRG-P) with respect to other maturation or transforming events. The BRG-P cell line, derived from an AIDS patient, was of special value since it displayed subclones that had undergone an isotype switch from IgM to IgA1 (BRG-M and BRG-A cells). BRG-M and BRG-A cells were characterized by the same monoclonal c-myc and VDJ rearrangements and by the expression of Ig receptors with specificity for a 45 kDa protein of human breast cells. Analysis of p53 mutations in the different BRG subclones showed that 1) BRG-M cells displayed 2 different p53 mutations in trans; since the original BL cells also showed the same mutations, this finding indicated that both occurred in vivo; 2) one of the p53 alleles of BRG- A cells was lost, while the other showed a mutation different from those seen in BRG-M cells; and 3) all 3 mutations observed in BRG-M or BRG-A cells resulted in the functional inactivation of the transcriptional activation function of p53. Together, our data demonstrate that p53 mutations were relatively late events during lymphomagenesis. Moreover, in view of the role of p53 in cell apoptosis, it is conceivable that BRG cells were subjected to a strong selective pressure that favored p53 inactivation. Such inactivation was possibly required to counterbalance other potentially apoptotic events, including the presence of a deregulated c-myc oncogene and signals delivered by the host environment in situ",

    "Title": "Prevalence and predictive value of p53 mutation in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas: a prospective clinico- pathological study and survival analysis of 70 patients",
    "Abstract": "The tissues from 70 Chinese patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma were prospectively collected to study for the pattern of p53 mutations and its relationship with clinico-pathological features and prognosis using immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. p53 over-expression and p53 mutations were detected in 73% and 44% of the patients. These p53 aberrations had no relationship with the patient age, sex, smoking/drinking habits and tumor site, size or stage. The p53 over-expression was more intense in moderately/poorly- differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. Thirty-three p53 mutations were noted in 31 patients; 18.2% in exon 5, 15.2% in exon 6, 33.3% in exon 7 and 33.3% in exon 8. Mutations were primarily point mutations and common in codons 248, 273 and 285. There were 46% transversions, 36% transitions and 18% frameshift. The survival of the patients depended mainly on the extent of resection. In patients with stage III oesophageal cancer, the median survival of those with p53 mutations was 6.8 months whereas those without was 12.5 months. The results were of clinical importance although the value did not reach statistical significance. Thus, there was a definite role of p53 mutations in the pathogenesis of oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas. p53 mutations were not synonymous with p53 over-expression. The distribution of p53 mutations in oesophageal cancers suggested that the etiologic contribution might be complex and probably involve different exogenous and endogenous exposures. p53 mutations also appear to play a role in predicting the survival of patients with stage III oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas",

    "Title": "Establishment and characterization of human gastric carcinoma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "We report 8 newly established gastric-carcinoma cell lines (SNU-216, 484, 520, 601, 620, 638, 668, 719) from Korean patients. Morphologic study was carried out using light and electron microscopes. CEA, alpha FP, and CA 19-9 and TPA in supernatant and in cell lysate were measured by radioimmunoassay. p53 and c-Ki-ras gene mutations were screened and confirmed by sequencing. The cell lines, derived from tumors with moderate differentiation, grew as a diffuse monolayer, and those from tumors with poor differentiation and minimal desmoplasia grew exclusively as non-adherent. Out of the 8 gastric-cancer cell lines, 5 had detectable levels of CEA both in supernatant and in cell lysate; there was no expression or secretion of alpha FP in these cells; 4 cell lines showed high levels of CA 19-9 in cell pellets. All cell lines except SNU-484 had high concentrations of TPA both in cell lysate and in supernatants. p53 mutation was found in 6 cell lines (75%): 2 (SNU- 216 and SNU-668) had mutations in exon 6, and other 3 in exon 8. The c- Ki-ras mutation was found in 2 cell lines (25%), SNU-601 and SNU-668. The former showed GGT-to-GAT transition mutation at codon 12, while the latter showed CAA-to-AAA transversion mutation at codon 61. DNA profiles using restriction endonuclease HinfI and polymorphic DNA probes ChdTC-15 and ChdTC-114 showed different unique patterns; which suggests that these cell lines are unique and not cross-contaminated. We believe that the newly characterized gastric-cancer cell lines presented in this paper will provide a useful in vitro model for studies related to human gastric cancer",

    "Title": "Prevalence of p53 mutations and protein expression in esophageal cancers in southern Thailand",
    "Abstract": "To investigate p53 alterations in esophageal squamous-cell carcinomas of patients in the high-risk area of southern Thailand, 72 paraffin- embedded samples were analyzed immunohistochemically for p53 protein expression and 16 frozen samples for p53 mutational status. Forty-two of the 72 tumors (58.3%) showed p53 protein accumulation in the nuclei of tumor cells. Expression of p53 in tumors was not significantly correlated with gender, histological grading, depth of invasion, node involvement, smoking or alcohol consumption. Analysis of the p53 gene in a sub-set of 16 tumors showed mis-sense mutations in 7 out of 11 p53- positive and 1 out of 5 p53-negative tumors. The p53 mutational spectrum was 50% transitions (3 C-to-T and 1 G-to-A, all occurring at CpG dinucleotide sites) and 50% transversions (one each, C-to-G, G-to- T, T-to-G, and T-to-A). Our findings support the hypothesis that alterations of p53 are involved in the carcinogenesis of most squamous- cell carcinomas of the esophagus, irrespective of the population and the factors responsible for carcinogenesis. The mutation profile of the p53 gene might indicate etiologic contributions of different mutagen exposures in patients from high-risk areas of southern Thailand",

    "Title": "Genetic diversity at the p53 locus between primary human colorectal adenocarcinomas and their lymph-node metastases",
    "Abstract": "In both the primary tumor and associated lymph-node metastases of 40 cases of Dukes' C colorectal adenocarcinomas, exons 5 to 9 of the p53 tuor-suppressor gene were examined by PCR amplification and single-strand-conformation-polymorphism (SSCP) analysis.  Mobility shifts indicating p53 mutations, which were confirmed by direct sequencing, were identified in 14 primary cancers (35%) and in 19 of the 40 lymph-node metastases (48%). In 12 cases (30%), the p53-mutation status in the primary cancer and its lymph-node metastases was identical. This result compatible with the hypothesis that when a p53 mutation occurs before the establishment of lymph-node metastasis, it subsequently persists in the metastatic nodes. In 7 cases (18%), p53 mutations were identified in lymph-node metastases that weren ot concordant with the p53 status in the primary tumor.  This finding can be explained by assuming that (1) p53 heterogeneity existing in the primary tumor is not reflected in all metastases and/or (2) new p53 mutations may occur during the development of metastatic lesions.",

    "Abstract": "We examined the association between mutation of the p53 gene and survival in a large cohort of breast cancer patients. Using a rapid, non-isotopic single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method we screened for mutations in exons 4-10 of the p53 gene in 375 primary breast cancers from patients with a median follow-up of 57 months. Mutations were found in 19% of tumours. Statistically significant associations were found between p53 mutation and histological grade, hormone receptor status, ploidy and S-phase fraction. No association was found between p53 mutation and axillary lymph node involvement, histological type, tumour size, vascular invasion or patient age. In univariate survival analysis, p53 mutation was strongly associated with poor prognosis. This was maintained in the lymph node-negative and hormone receptor-positive patient subgroups. In multivariate analysis, p53 mutation was associated with poor survival independent of lymph node status, estrogen receptor status and S-phase fraction. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using a rapid and simple polymerase chain reaction-SSCP screening procedure to detect p53 gene mutation in breast cancer for the provision of prognostic information",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in childhood thyroid tumours from Belarus and in thyroid tumours without radiation history",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 tumour-suppressor gene (exons 5-8) were investigated in 31 Belarussian childhood thyroid tumours (24 cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma, 3 benign tumours and 2 cases each of thyroiditis and goiter); 33 thyroid tumours from juveniles and adults without radiation exposures (25 carcinomas of various histological types, including 11 papillary carcinomas and 8 adenomas) and 6 tumours from adults (4 papillary carcinomas, 1 adenoma, 1 goiter) served as controls. The mutational spectrum of p53 differed greatly between the childhood thyroid carcinomas from Belarus and the control groups. In the control groups of 29 malignant thyroid tumours, 7 different mutations were detected on exons 5-8, none of which occurred among the 15 papillary carcinomas in this group. Five mutations were found in tissue samples of the 24 childhood papillary carcinomas, and they were all the same p53 point mutation (CGA --> CGG) on codon 213 of exon 6. To determine whether this mutation is simply a polymorphism or whether it is specific to the tumour cells, laser-assisted microdissection was applied to collect various areas of tumorous and non-tumorous cells (10- 20 cells per sample) from each paraffin-embedded tissue section of 8 of the papillary thyroid carcinomas. Using PCR-SSCP and sequence analysis on these cells, the very same p53 mutation on codon 213 was detected in various microdissected tumour samples of 2 cases, but it was not found in any microdissected non-tumorous sample. The exclusive occurrence of this p53 mutation in selective microdissected samples of tumour cells, even as homozygous mutation in 1 case, reflects a distinct tumour heterogeneity within papillary childhood thyroid carcinomas",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine whether potential alteration in p53 function through p53 gene mutation or mdm-2 overexpression correlates with early treatment failure in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnostic marrow samples from 34 children were analyzed for p53 gene alterations by western blot and SSCP/DNA sequence analysis and for mdm-2 overexpression by western blot analysis. These samples were derived from two groups of children with ALL: 17 good outcome patients who are in long-term continuous complete remission and 17 poor outcome patients who did not achieve a complete remission or relapsed within 6 months of achieving remission. RESULTS: Two children within the poor outcome group were found to have p53 gene mutations. Furthermore, five poor outcome patients were shown to have greater than 10-fold overexpression of mdm-2 protein compared with the mean level of mdm-2 protein measured in the good outcome group. Aberrant p53 protein expression was found in only one good outcome patient, whereas no good outcome children were found to have elevated levels (> 10-fold) of mdm- 2 protein. CONCLUSION: We show for the first time that potential alteration in p53 function in childhood ALL is more common (P = .036) in cases of early treatment failure than in children who remain in long- term continuous remission",

    "Title": "Reappraisal of p53 mutations in human malignant astrocytic neoplasms by p53 functional assay: comparison with conventional structural analyses",
    "Abstract": "We previously reported clonal expansion of p53 mutations in malignant astrocytic tumors detected with a yeast p53 functional assay that measures mutant p53 alleles quantitatively and loss of p53 transcriptional competence qualitatively (Tada et al., Int J Cancer 67:447-450, 1996). This method selectively detects inactivating mutations and is relatively insensitive to contamination of tumor samples with normal tissue. To determine whether the mutation frequency and spectrum detected in this way differ from those seen with conventional techniques, 54 malignant astrocytomas were tested with the yeast assay, and the abnormalities detected were characterized by DNA sequencing. Inactivating p53 mutations were found in 67% of anaplastic astrocytomas and 41% of glioblastomas. Overall, mutations were found in 48% of tumors, compared with only 29% in previous studies (P < 0.005), a difference that probably reflects the greater sensitivity of the yeast assay than of conventional techniques. The frequency of mutations in anaplastic astrocytomas (in our study plus published studies) was significantly higher than in glioblastomas (39% vs 29%; P < 0.05). This suggests that acquisition of p53 mutations is not rate limiting for progression to glioblastoma and that many glioblastomas develop by p53- independent pathways. Sequencing of mutant p53 cDNAs rescued from yeast showed that the mutation spectrum for functionally inactive mutants was nearly identical to the spectra from previous studies on structural mutants, indicating that transcriptional activity is the critical biological target of p53 mutation in malignant astrocytomas",

    "Abstract": "We have screened the p53 status of 156 human cell lines, including 142 tumor cell lines from 27 different tumor types and 14 cell lines from normal tissues by using functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast. This assay enables us to score wild-type p53 expression on the basis of the ability of expressed p53 to transactivate the reporter gene HIS3 via the p53-responsive GAL1 promotor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Of 142 tumor cell lines, at least 104 lines (73.2%) were found to express the mutated p53 gene: 94 lines (66.2%) were mutated in both alleles, three lines (2.1%) were heterozygous, and no p53 cDNA was amplified from seven lines (4.9%). Of the 14 cell lines originating from normal tissues, all the transformed or immortalized cell lines expressed mutant p53 only. Yeast cells expressing mutant p53 derived from 94 cell lines were analyzed for temperature-sensitive growth. p53 cDNA from eight cell lines showed p53-dependent temperature-sensitive growth, growing at 30 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C. Four temperature-sensitive p53 mutations were isolated: CAT-->CGT at codon 214 (H214R), TAC-->TGC at codon 234 (Y234C), GTG-->ATG at codon 272 (V272M), and GAG-->AAG (E285K). Functionally wild-type p53 was detected in 38 tumor cell lines (26.8%) and all of the diploid fibroblasts at early and late population doubling levels. These results strongly support the previous findings that p53 inactivation is one of the most frequent genetic events that occurs during carcinogenesis and immortalization",

    "Title": "Mutations of the p53 gene as a prognostic factor in aggressive B-cell lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mutations of the p53 gene are associated with a poor prognosis in several types of cancer. We investigated the prognostic importance of p53 mutations in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma. METHODS: We examined the relation between the presence or absence of a detectable p53 mutation in lymphoma cells and the response to chemotherapy and overall survival in 102 previously untreated patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Mutations of the p53 gene were identified by polymerase-chain-reaction-mediated analysis of single-strand conformation polymorphisms and by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Of 102 cases of aggressive B-cell lymphoma, 22 (22 percent) involved p53 mutations. The rate of complete remission was significantly lower in patients with a tumor carrying a p53 mutation (6 of 22 patients, 27 percent) than in those with the wild-type p53 gene (61 of 80 patients, 76 percent) (P<0.001). Overall survival was significantly lower among patients with p53 mutations than among those with the wild-type p53 gene; the Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival at five years were 16 percent and 64 percent, respectively (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis incorporating prognostic factors from the international prognostic index demonstrated that p53 mutations had independent effects on the rates of complete remission and survival. When we categorized patients according to the international prognostic index, we found no effect of p53 mutations in patients in the groups at high-intermediate and high risk. However, these mutations were significantly associated (P< 0.001) with low rates of complete remission (33 percent vs. 91 percent) and survival (27 percent vs. 81 percent at five years) in the groups at low and low-intermediate risk. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations of the p53 gene are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma",

    "Title": "Homozygous p53 gene mutation in a radiation-induced glioblastoma 10 years after treatment for an intracranial germ cell tumor: case report",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Radiation-induced glioma is a rare but serious complication of radiotherapy. Underlying radiation-induced mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes have not previously been described. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 16-year-old female patient developed a glioblastoma in the right frontal lobe 10 years after treatment of a suprasellar germ cell tumor with 50 Gy ionizing radiation. The glioblastoma was undetectable on a high-resolution magnetic resonance image obtained 3 months before diagnosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: A p53 functional assay was used to examine the transcriptional competence of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. This assay scores the content of mutant p53 alleles in tumor and blood samples quantitatively as a percentage of red yeast colonies. The glioblastoma contained 95% mutant p53 alleles, whereas blood from the patient and her parents contained only normal background levels of red colonies. Sequencing revealed that the mutation in the tumor was a 3-base pair deletion affecting codons 238 and 239. Intragenic deletion within the p53 deoxyribonucleic acid binding domain is uncommon in sporadic tumors but would be entirely consistent with misrepair of a radiation-induced double-strand deoxyribonucleic acid break in this case. CONCLUSION: This is the first case in which a causative underlying genetic event has been identified in a radiation- induced glioblastoma. We infer that mutation of one p53 allele occurred at the time of radiotherapy, and the sudden appearance of the tumor 10 years later occurred after loss of the remaining wild-type allele and/or other genetic alterations, such as chromosome 10 loss and epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification",

DESIGN: Expression of p53 oncoprotein in immunohistochemical staining and its correlation to gene mutations in DNA extracted from KAs and tested in single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing. SETTING: A micrographic surgery unit and a dermatopathology unit at a university medical center. PATIENTS: Sixteen formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin biopsy specimens were retrieved from dermatopathology archives. Biopsies were performed to establish the diagnosis of KA before surgical treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intensity of staining in immunohistochemical testing for p53 oncoprotein expression and sequencing of gene mutations. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining of 16 KA specimens detected p53 oncoprotein in 15 (94%), distributed as strong in 4 (25%), moderate in 2 (12%) mild in 9 (56%), and negative in 1 (6%), compared with control specimens. Specimens were screened by SSCP for mutations in the p53 gene, and 1 specimen showed a potential mutation in exon 7. Direct sequencing of the samples revealed 2 point mutations. One specimen showed a change of G:A for A:G in codon 146 of exon 5, predicting an amino acid substitution of tryptophan for a stop codon. Another specimen revealed a change of T:A for A:T in codon 234 of exon 7, predicting an amino acid substitution of tyrosine for asparagine. CONCLUSIONS: Ninety-four percent of KA specimens evaluated had detectable p53 oncoprotein. This protein was associated with a point mutation in the p53 gene in 2 of 16 KAs evaluated. In a small fraction of KAs, overexpression of p53 oncoprotein may be associated with point mutations in the p53 gene",

    "Abstract": "Clinical and experimental evidence is consistent with a key role of point mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in the etiology of squamous cell carcinoma. To determine the relation of tumor behavior and patient survival in vulvar cancer in regard to p53 status, we retrospectively analyzed 38 paraffin-embedded specimens of primary vulvar cancer for genetic alterations of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene. For detection of p53 point mutations we used in vitro amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) and, as a detection method, direct sequencing for mutation verification. p53 point mutations were detected in 12/38 tumor specimens. Patients bearing p53 point mutations showed a significantly shorter relapse-free (log-rank test, P = 0.002) and overall survival time (log-rank test, P = 0.0006). We conclude that PCR- TGGE is an appropriate method for detection of p53 point mutations in paraffin-embedded material. We show that loss of wild-type p53 is an adverse prognostic factor in patients suffering from vulvar cancer",

    "Abstract": "Individuals with one aerodigestive tract malignancy have a high incidence of second primary aerodigestive tumors. The mechanism for this field effect has not been determined. We studied an individual with widespread dysplastic changes in the respiratory epithelium but no overt carcinoma. The entire tracheobronchial tree obtained at autopsy was embedded in paraffin, and bronchial epithelial cells were isolated by microdissection. DNA extracted from the microdissected cells was analyzed for point mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. A single, identical point mutation consisting of a G:C to T:A transversion in codon 245 was identified in bronchial epithelium from 7 of 10 sites in both lungs. Epithelium at sites containing the p53 mutation was morphologically abnormal, exhibiting squamous metaplasia and mild to moderate atypia. No invasive tumor was found in the tracheobronchial tree or any other location. Cells from peripheral blood, kidney, liver, and lymph node exhibited no abnormality in the p53 gene. The widespread presence of a single somatic p53 point mutation in the bronchi of a smoker suggests that a single progenitor bronchial epithelial clone may expand to populate broad areas of the bronchial mucosa-a novel mechanism for field carcinogenesis in the respiratory epithelium that may be of importance in assessing individuals for risk of a second primary tumor as well as in devising effective strategies for chemoprevention of lung cancer",

    "Abstract": "AIMS: To study the loss of heterozygosity and the presence of mutations at the p53, p16/CDKN2, and APC genes in Barrett's oesophagus, low grade dysplastic oesophageal epithelium, and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus; to relate the presence of alterations at these genes with the progression from Barrett's oesophagus to adenocarcinoma. METHODS: DNA was extracted from paraffin blocks containing tissue from Barrett's oesophagus (12 samples), low grade dysplasia (15 cases), and adenocarcinoma (14 cases). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the p53, p16, and APC genes was determined by comparing the autoradiographic patterns of several microsatellite markers between the normal tissue and the malignant tissue counterpart. SSCP was used to determine the presence of mutations at p53 (exons 5 to 8), p16 (exon 2), and APC. Homozygous deletion of the p16 gene was defined through polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern blot. RESULTS: LOH at the p53, p16, and APC genes was not observed in Barrett's oesophagus without dysplasia, and increased to 90% (p53), 89% (p16), and 60% (APC) in the adenocarcinomas. The p53 gene was mutated in only two adenocarcinomas (codons 175 and 245). In one case a mutation at the APC gene (codon 1297) was found. No patient had mutation at the second exon of p16. However, this gene was homozygously deleted in three of the 12 adenocarcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: The tumour suppressor genes p53, p16, and APC are often deleted in adenocarcinomas derived from Barrett's oesophagus. Mutations at these genes are also found in the adenocarcinomas, including the homozygous deletion of the p16 gene. However, the absence of genetic alterations in the Barrett's oesophagus and the low grade dysplastic epithelia suggest that mutations at these genes develop later in the progression from Barrett's oesophagus to adenocarcinoma",

This study aimed at identifying a molecular marker that would be useful in overcoming the drawbacks of histopathology. Forty-four thymic epithelial tumours were analysed for alterations of the tumour suppressor gene p53 using immunohistochemistry (antibodies D0-1 and CM- 1) and PCR-based single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing. Histological and clinical evaluation and also p53 analysis revealed three major tumour groups: non-organotypic thymic carcinomas with frequent p53 alterations (7/9) and occurrence of p53 gene mutations (2/9); malignant thymomas with frequent p53 alterations but without p53 gene mutations (11/18); and benign thymomas with rare p53 alterations and without p53 gene mutations (2/17). In non-organotypic thymic carcinomas p53 was detected with both antibodies. In contrast, thymomas lacked immunoreaction with D0-1 suggesting alteration of the antibody-binding site. Overall immunohistochemical results correlated with clinical stages (P < 0.01), pathohistology (P < 0.01), and survival times (P < 0.05). We consider immunohistochemical p53 detection to be a useful new prognostic factor for the evaluation of thymic epithelial tumours",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutation analysis in tumors of patients exposed to alpha- particles",
    "Abstract": "The p53 gene was examined for point mutations in archived, alpha- radiation-associated lung and liver cancers. Lung tumors of 50 uranium miners in Germany were screened by restriction fragment length analysis for the putative hotspot mutation at codon 249 (Arg-->Met) previously detected in a significant fraction of miners from the Colorado Plateau, USA. This mutation has been proposed as a marker of radon exposure. None of the tumors we examined harbored the hotspot mutation. Five of the 50 tumors, however, did indeed harbor exon 7 mutations, as determined by subsequent mutation analysis of exon 7. These mutations were dispersed among various codons and may be attributable to heavy tobacco smoking in this cohort. In support of this interpretation, we found no mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene in 13 iatrogenic liver cancers induced by injection of Thorotrast, an alpha-emitting radiocontrast agent. We propose that if the p53 tumor suppressor gene is a target for the carcinogenic action of alpha-particle radiation, loss of suppressor function may occur preferentially by mechanisms such as intrachromosomal deletions, rather than by base substitution mutations",

    "Title": "Differences in the p53 gene mutational spectra of prostate cancers between Japan and Western countries",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 gene are related to development of human cancers and their frequencies and spectra, the latter representing fingerprints left by carcinogens, provide information about the molecular epidemiology of the disease. Prostate cancer is the most common neoplasm in American males and although its incidence is still relatively low in Japanese people, it has recently been increasing with the westernization of life style. To assess the frequency and spectrum of p53 gene mutations in Japanese prostate cancers, we examined a series of 90 lesions using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single- strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. The patients' mean age was 69.3 years (range 57-87). Of the total, six were well-, 34 moderately- and 50 poorly-differentiated adenocarcinomas, and the median Gleason score was 7.9. Eleven of the 90 cases (12%) had mutations in exons 2-11 of the p53 gene: none of the five clinical- stage A, one of 25 stage B (4%), three of 35 stage C (9%) and seven of 25 stage D (28%) cancers. The correlation with an advanced stage was statistically significant. One insertion and 10 base pair substitutions were encountered, comprising six transversions (55%) and four transitions (36%). Two of the latter involved methylated cytosine- guanine (CpG). These 11 mutations were combined with 18 other mutations in previous reports concerning Japanese prostate cancers to facilitate comparison of the p53 gene mutational spectrum with those reported for American and European prostate cancers. In the latter, 61% were transitions and 33% were transversions. The greater proportion of transversions in the Japanese population suggests that there are different factors responsible for carcinogenesis of the prostate glands in the various countries",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to document the status of p53 expression and mutation in cervical cancer at protein, RNA and DNA levels and to relate this to the presence of HPV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biopsy specimens from one hundred and three squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and histologically normal ectocervix were analysed. Fresh tissues were extracted for protein, RNA and DNA and flash frozen tissue cryostat sectioned for immunohistochemical staining. HPV DNA status was determined by PCR using L1 consensus primers and typed for HPV 16 and 18 with E6 specific primers. p53 expression was determined at the protein level by Western blotting on protein extracts and at RNA level by Northern blotting. RESULTS: There was no p53 overexpression or mutation detectable in the protein extracts. Three of 65 (4.6%) of the carcinomas were positive for p53 by immunostaining with the polyclonal antibody CM1. Overexpression at the RNA level was detected in 2 of 32 (6.3%) carcinomas. p53 mutation was screened for by PCR/SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphism) followed by sequencing to define the site of mutation. Two of the cervical cancers (2.0%) showed mutation in p53 in exons 7 or 8. The mutation rate in HPV positive tumours was 1.2% (1/81) and in HPV negative tumours was 5.2% (1/19). CONCLUSION: p53 overexpression or mutation does not seem to play a significant role in cervical carcinomas",

    "Title": "Mutation analysis of p53 gene in childhood malignant solid tumors",
    "Abstract": "Alterations of the p53 gene have been extensively investigated in a wide variety of human malignancies. However, data on childhood malignant solid tumors are still limited. Mutations of the p53 gene on exons 5 through 8 were examined in 82 childhood malignant solid tumors by the polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method, and the nature of these mutations was confirmed by direct sequencing. The 82 tumors examined included neuroblastomas (n = 44), Wilms' tumors in = 13), hepatoblastomas (n = 11), rhabdomyosarcomas (n = 10), extraosseus Ewing sarcomas (n = 2), undifferentiated sarcoma of the liver (n = 1), and fibrosarcoma (n = 1). Two sarcoma samples were identified as having point mutations. One was a rhabdomyosarcoma with a missense mutation at codon 273, substituting histidine (His) for arginine (Arg). Another was an undifferentiated sarcoma of the liver with a missense mutation at codon 245, substituting serine (Ser) for glycine (Gly). No mutations were detected among neuroblastomas, Wilms' tumors, or hepatoblastomas. The two sarcomas with mutations were localized tumors. Both patients who had these tumors are disease free for 8 and 5 years after treatment, respectively. The overall incidence of p53 mutations was low (2.4%, 2 of 82). However, the incidence, when calculated for sarcomas, was higher at 14.3% (2 of 14). These data indicate that p53 mutations are generally uncommon in childhood malignant solid tumors examined. However, in some childhood sarcomas, p53 mutations appear to have a causative role in the development of these tumors",

    "Title": "Altered WAF1 genes do not play a role in abnormal cell cycle regulation in breast cancers lacking p53 mutations",
    "Abstract": "Seventy-five to 80% of breast cancers are negative for p53 gene mutations. We have investigated the possibility that altered WAF1 genes provide an alternative mode of cell cycle disruption in these tumors. DNA from a total of 85 primary breast tumors and cell lines from both the United States and Australia were examined for WAF1 and p53 mutations. With the exception of one primary tumor containing the polymorphic codon 31 (AGC-->AGA), no missense mutations in the WAF1 gene were found in 33 primary tumors or in the 19 cell lines from the United States. By contrast, 2 of 33 tumors from Australia contained tumor-specific missense mutations in the WAF1 gene, while an additional six cases contained the AGC-->AGA polymorphic 31st codon in the WAF1 gene. The p53 mutation frequency in the Australian cohort (18%) was found to be similar to that reported by us (Glebov et al., Cancer Res., 54: 3703-3709, 1994; Runnebaum et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88: 10657-10661, 1991) in the tumors of United States patients (13%) with sporadic breast cancer. Thus, mutations in the WAF1 gene are rare in tumors with or without p53 mutations, suggesting that except in a minor population of breast cancer patients of Caucasian origin, cell cycle dysregulation by mutated p53 or WAF1 genes may not contribute to breast tumor initiation or progression",

    "Title": "Primary human prostate cancer cells harboring p53 mutations are clonally expanded in metastases",
    "Abstract": "Recent studies suggest a role for p53 in prostate cancer progression. Although p53 mutations in primary prostate cancer tissues are relatively infrequent, they occur at significant levels in metastatic disease. Here we describe a novel approach to the molecular analysis of p53 in paired specimens of primary and metastatic prostate cancer that results in quantitative estimates of the extent of clonal expansion. In 20 pairs with 1 or both specimens p53 immunopositive and in 6 pairs with both specimens immunonegative, the frequency of mutations was estimated by microdissection of the cancer from fixed and sectioned tissues, isolation of the DNA followed by PCR amplification of p53 genomic fragments, and cloning of the PCR products into plasmid vectors. At least 90 clones/tissue specimen were screened for mutations by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis. DNA from abnormally migrating single-strand conformational polymorphism samples was sequenced to confirm mutations. Missense mutations in exon 5, 7, or 8 were detected in 9 of 20 immunopositive pairs and in 1 of 6 immunonegative pairs. A marked heterogeneity of mutations in primary prostate cancer was apparent. The frequency of p53 mutations was greater in the metastases than in the primary tumors. In three immunopositive pairs, the same p53 mutation was demonstrated at a low frequency in the primary tumor but was demonstrated at a greater frequency in the metastasis, indicating relatively limited clonal expansion of cells harboring specific p53 mutations in the primary tumor, yet significant clonal growth at metastatic sites as determined by this novel method",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the interrelationship between p53 gene alterations, MDR1 gene expression, and S-phase fraction (SPF) in breast carcinomas treated primarily with chemotherapy or radiotherapy and correlated the results with patient outcome to determine the potential clinical significance of these factors. In a consecutive series of 64 fine- needle samplings of breast cancer patients who underwent either neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 53) or radiotherapy (n = 11), p53 (exons 5-9) gene alterations by denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis and subsequent direct sequencing, MDR1 gene expression by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and SPF by DNA flow cytometry were determined. Our results show that p53 mutations (n = 20) were significantly associated (P = 0.01) with high SPF but not with de novo MDR1 gene expression. Most patients with wild-type p53 tumors were found to be resistant to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. No correlation was observed between p53 mutations and the induction of MDR1 gene expression during treatment. Although a significant correlation between shorter distant disease-free survival and high (>/=5%) SPF (P = 0.016) was found, no correlation between distant disease-free survival and p53 status or intrinsic MDR1 gene expression was found. Poor overall survival was observed in patients with tumors with high SPF (P < 0.0004) or lacking MDR1 gene expression (P = 0.03) before treatment, but not with p53 alterations. These data suggest that SPF remains the most relevant biological factor for breast cancer patients treated by primary chemotherapy or radiotherapy and that p53 and MDR1 status may identify a small subset of patients that may resist therapy or pursue an aggressive course",

    "Title": "Detection of p53 point mutations by double-gradient, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis",
    "Abstract": "Genetic instability is a typical feature of tumor cells. This evidence has stimulated the development of rapid methods for detection of gene mutations. A new, improved protocol for denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), to screen for point mutations in genomic DNA, is reported: double gradient (DG) DGGE. In this technique, to the primary, denaturing gradient (typically 30-80% or 40-80% urea/formamide) a secondary gradient, colinear with the first, is superimposed: a porosity gradient (typically 6.5-12% polyacrylamide). The secondary gradient acts by recompacting smeared and diffuse bands of heteroduplexes, which are often indistinguishable from background fluorescence, and by augmenting the resolution between closely spaced homoduplex zones. This allows proper densitometric quantitation of the ratio of the two homoduplex bands. The reliability of this technique has been documented by detection of a number of mutations in exons 6 and 8 of the p53 gene which had escaped revelation by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Additionally, the precise assessment of ratio of the doublet of homoduplex bands has allowed quantitation of the extent of p53 mutation in a mixed cell population extracted from a tumor specimen",

    "Abstract": "We report a new nonradioactive method to detect sequence changes, including single-base substitutions through shifts in electrophoretic mobility using an automated fluorescence sequencer (ALFexpress, Pharmacia, Biotech) connected to external cooling equipment. Single strands were identified by incorporation of fluorescein-labeled primers during amplification and subsequent laser detection at the bottom of the gel. The amplified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were heat-denatured and loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions and strict control of constant low temperature. Peak shifts in the fluorogram indicated mutations. A novel gel composition improved the detection rate for mutations considerably. Automatic analysis of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) gels saves time and costs, and is highly reproducible. The method was applied for mutation screening in exon 7 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in DNA of freshly frozen soft tissue tumors. The mutation spectrum and frequency in exon 7 of the p53 gene are discussed with respect to oncogenesis in soft tissue sarcomas",

    "Abstract": "The tumor suppressor genes p53, retinoblastoma (RB), p16, and p15 encode proteins that regulate the cell cycle cooperatively by controlling the transition from G1 to S phase and may play an important role in cell growth and differentiation. To screen for abnormalities in these genes in cancer, we performed genetic analysis in six human pancreatic cancer and five hepatoma cell lines, by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, direct sequencing, and the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All six pancreatic cancer cell lines had p53 mutations, with the concomitant loss of the other normal allele, encoding wild-type p53. Frequent homozygous deletions were found in p16 and p15, but the RB gene was expressed. Four of the five hepatoma cell lines had p53 mutations with loss of the normal allele and aberrant RB. There were no deletions of p16 and p15 in any of the hepatoma cell lines. These findings suggest that alterations in the p53, p16, and p15 genes are common in human pancreatic cancer cell lines, while p53 or RB mutations are common in hepatoma cell lines. Alterations of these tumor suppressor genes may thus be important features in organ-specific carcinogenesis",

    "Abstract": "We used a yeast functional assay (functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast: FASAY) to determine the p53 gene status of human cell lines maintained in our laboratory. This assay enables the researcher to score wild-type p53 expression on the basis of the ability of expressed p53 to transactivate the reporter gene HIS 3 via the p53- responsive GAL 1 promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cell lines examined were ten hepatoma, two hepatoblastoma, three in vitro immortalized fibroblast, two osteosarcoma, a chondrosarcoma, an ovarian teratocarcinoma and a colon cancer cell line. Out of 20 cell lines, 11 cell lines had mutations in both alleles of the p53 gene, and another 8 cell lines had no mutation in the p53 gene. Thus, 55% of the cell lines examined had mutations in the p53. Interestingly, PA-1 cells had both the normal and the mutant p53 alleles, showing that FASAY is a useful method for detecting the wild-type and mutated p53 genes simultaneously. As for the three liver cell lines harboring HBsAg, there was no relationship between their p53 gene status and the presence of HBsAg. Two cell lines were normal for p53 status, while the other had a mutation of the p53 gene",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to correlate p53 gene alterations and their expression in 85 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Genomic p53 was amplified with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Exons 5 through 8 were screened for mutations by means of non-isotopic single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. p53 expression was detected by means of immunohistochemistry (IHC) with the p53 monoclonal antibody DO-7. Twenty-three lesions (27%) showed both SSCP variants and DO-7 immunostaining, whereas 37 (44%) demonstrated both SSCP normal patterns and negative staining. Twenty-five lesions (29%) were discordant, including 12 IHC-positive (14%) and 13 SSCP-positive (15%) lesions. However, discordant IHC-negative, SSCP-positive lesions could have been easily interpreted after sequencing of the abnormal samples. Had these been screened with IHC only, all nonsense or frameshift p53 mutations would have been missed. IHC-positive, SSCP-negative lesions were interpreted in light of current models of p53 immunodetection. Had these been screened with SSCP or sequencing only, a sizeable number of tumors expressing p53 protein abnormalities would have been undetected. Therefore, simultaneous use of both methods increases the number of p53 abnormalities detected, and is warranted",

Twenty-nine of 92 lymphomas overexpressed p53, and 17 overexpressed p21. Of the p53 overexpressing lymphomas, 14 also overexpressed p21, and none of these 14 harbored a detectable hot spot mutation. However, mutations were detected in 13 (87%) of 15 p53 overexpressing, p21 negative lymphomas. One of the 63 p53-negative lymphomas harbored a detectable hot spot mutation, and it was also negative for p21. These results demonstrate that among NHLs that overexpress p53 protein, those which also show p21 overexpression do not harbor p53 hot spot mutations, and furthermore, provide evidence that the transactivating function of p53 is retained. On the other hand, p53 overexpression in NHLs that lack p21 expression is usually indicative of p53 gene mutation",

    "Title": "Enriched SSCP: a highly sensitive method for the detection of unknown mutations. Application to the molecular diagnosis of lung cancer in sputum samples",
    "Abstract": "Detection of gene mutations by sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods can allow to identify occult neoplastic cells in a great excess of nonmalignant cells. These molecular approaches have an enormous potential in terms of early diagnosis, detection of occult micrometastases of solid tumors, and minimal residual disease in patients with hematopoietic malignancies. Currently, the applications of such methods are limited, mainly because the high sensitivity required for the identification of rare mutated alleles can be achieved only in cases in which mutations occur in few specific codons of a gene or when the mutation is already known. No methods are available by which few alleles with unknown mutations in tumor genes can be recognized in a great excess of wild-type alleles. We have developed an extremely sensitive method, termed enriched single-strand conformational polymorphism (E-SSCP), which permits detection of a rare alleles with unknown mutations. The method is based on the observation that after a conventional SSCP analysis the vast majority of mutated bands migrate close to the wild-type bands. The area of the gel having the highest chance to hold mutated alleles is physically isolated and is used as substrate for a second round of SSCP. Serially diluted DNA samples containing gene mutations demonstrated detection of 1 mutant/10(6) normal alleles. The E-SSCP assay was first applied to six sputum samples of patients affected by lung cancers with known p53 mutations showing in sputa the same mutations observed in tumors. The technique was then applied to eight cytologically negative sputum samples obtained from patients who later developed a clinically manifested lung carcinoma. In three cases, harboring a p53 mutation in tumor tissue, the E-SSCP analysis allowed the detection of the mutations in sputa months before clinical diagnosis. In conclusion, we have presented a general, highly sensitive technique for the detection of unknown mutations that may have several potential applications and may hold considerable promise for the early detection and study of cancer",

By using reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as a prescreening technique and posterior sequencing, we observe new mutations in the RB1 gene, notably a duplication in tandem of exons 3 through 6. TP53 mutations appear in codons most frequently mutated in osteosarcomas. We have not seen MDM2 gene amplification in any reported case. These molecular alterations appear in different osteosarcomas not simultaneously present in the same tumor sample. A link has been described between these three genes in the pathways that control the cell cycle and the tumoral progression, but their functions are probably independent in the development of osteosarcomas. TP53 mutations appear in adult patients, whereas RB1 alterations occur mostly in younger patients",

    "Title": "Relationship between radiation response and p53 status in human bladder cancer cells [published erratum appears in Int J Radiat Biol 1997 Dec;72(6);760]",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 tumour suppressor gene are found at high frequency in bladder cancer. There is strong evidence that p53 plays an important role in controlling the cell cycle after DNA damage by ionizing radiation. However, the effect of loss of p53 function on radiosensitivity is not yet clear. Radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy is the most common treatment for patients with invasive bladder cancer. Recently three bladder cancer cell lines have been established and this paper investigates the p53 status and clonogenic survival of these cell lines following irradiation. It was found that one line expresses wt p53 (UCRU-BL-13) and two lines contain a codon 72 polymorphism (UCRU-BL-17 and UCRU-BL-28). UCRU-BL-17 cells also contain a point mutation affecting codon 280. The level of p53 expression in the cell lines is clearly different, with UCRU-BL-17 expressing a higher level of p53 compared with UCRU-BL-13; UCRU-BL-28 expressed intermediate levels. The clonogenic survival of these cell lines has been determined. It was found that the line expressing a p53 mutation was more sensitive than those with wild type p53, providing support for a model in which loss of p53 function is associated with increased radiosensitivity, possibly due to reduced p53-dependent DNA repair",

    "Abstract": "The MYCN oncogene is amplified in 20% of childhood neuroblastoma and is associated independently with poor prognosis. Alteration of the p53 tumor supressor gene, in contrast, occurs infrequently in these tumors. In this report, we described a 3-year-old girl with stage IV neuroblastoma. Molecular analysis revealed, both MYCN gene amplification and a point mutation of the p53 tumor supressor gene. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of neuroblastoma with genetic alterations of both these genes",

    "Title": "p53 mutation and protein alteration in 50 gliomas. Retrospective study by DNA-sequencing techniques and immunohistochemistry",
    "Abstract": "Alterations of the p53 protein, which is a 53 kD phosphoprotein and gene product of the p53 gene, has been found to play a major role in the genesis of a variety of human malignancies including tumors of the central nervous system. We investigated 50 tumor specimens from primary central nervous system neoplasms. Tissue samples were screened for mutations by the single-strand conformation polymorphism method and detected mutations were sequenced. All tissue specimens were stained immunohistochemically for p53 protein, which when altered accumulates in the nucleus due to prolonged half-life. Mutations were found in six cases, including one pilocytic astrocytoma World Health Organization (WHO) grade I, two astrocytomas WHO grade II, two anaplastic astrocytomas WHO grade III, and one primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). In terms of relative frequency mutations were found mostly in the group of anaplastic astrocytomas WHO grade III. Interestingly, no mutations were found in the group of investigated glioblastomas. P53 immunopositivity did not correlated with the mutations found, whereas the staining index was significantly higher in the cases with detected mutations than in those without. When p53 alterations is seen as an indicator for different pathogenic pathways in glioma formation, this study gives evidence for a difference between anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma. However, since there was a great overlap in p53 immunopositivity and p53 mutation in tumors of different WHO grades and entities, it seems that p53 will not act as a marker molecule neither for tumor entities nor for tumor malignancy",

    "Title": "p53 abnormalities in primary prostate cancer: single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of complementary DNA in comparison with genomic DNA. The Cooperative Prostate Network",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The reported frequency of mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene (also known as TP53) in human carcinomas of the prostate has varied widely, ranging from 3% to 42%. This variability may be a consequence of tumor heterogeneity and/or the use of different methods of analysis. Since p53 mutation has been associated with clinical outcome for a number of cancer types, determination of its true frequency in primary carcinomas of the prostate is important. PURPOSE: The principal aims of this study were as follows: 1) to validate the utility of detecting p53 gene mutations by means of polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR- SSCP) analysis of complementary DNA (cDNA) (synthesized from prostate tissue RNA and 2) to study the concordance of RNA- and DNA-based PCR- SSCP assays in detecting p53 mutations in individual tumor fragments. METHODS: RNA and genomic DNA were isolated by means of standard techniques from specimens of 19 carcinomas of the prostate, selected on the basis of p53 data obtained in a previous analysis of cDNA (indicating that 14 were mutant and five were wild-type). RNA was converted into cDNA by means of reverse transcription (RT); the cDNA was then amplified by means of nonisotopic (i.e., nonradioactive) PCR, and the PCR products were subjected to SSCP analysis in polyacrylamide gels (RT-PCR-SSCP analysis). Genomic DNA was examined by means of SSCP analysis of isotopically labeled (32PO4) PCR products (DNA-PCR-SSCP analysis). In both approaches, the protein coding region of the p53 gene was divided into multiple, smaller fragments for study. PCR products exhibiting abnormal migration in SSCP gels were subjected to direct nucleotide sequencing or to cloning and sequencing of multiple clones. RESULTS: RT-PCR-SSCP and DNA-PCR-SSCP identified p53 gene abnormalities in 15 of the 19 selected carcinomas, including one previously reported to be wild-type for p53. Overall, PCR-SSCP analysis identified 18 p53 fragments with abnormalities; three carcinomas showed two abnormalities each. Six (33%) of the 18 abnormalities were detected by both RT-PCR-SSCP and DNA-PCR-SSCP, 10 (56%) were detected by RT-PCR- SSCP alone, and two (11%) were detected by DNA-PCR-SSCP alone. The 18 abnormalities were caused by 20 changes in the sequence of the p53 gene; in one carcinoma, double mutations in two individual p53 exons were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: PCR-SSCP analysis of both RNA and DNA allows the detection of more mutations than the analysis of either alone. Some primary carcinomas of the prostate contain more than one altered p53 gene, consistent with the possibility of intratumoral heterogeneity of mutation of this gene. For comprehensive analysis of p53 mutations in carcinomas of the prostate, and perhaps in other tumor tissues, SSCP analysis of cDNA should be used in combination with SSCP analysis of genomic DNA",

    "Title": "K-ras and p53 gene mutations in colorectal cancer in 57 Japanese patients",
    "Abstract": "Fifty-eight tissue specimens from 57 Japanese patients with colorectal cancer were analyzed for the K-ras and p53 gene mutations by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. K-ras mutations were detected in 21 cases (36.2%) and p53 mutations in 20 cases (34.5%). Eight specimens had both gene mutations. The K-ras mutation was associated with higher degrees of differentiation (p = 0.0019). The P53 mutation was associated with Duke B to D staging (p = 0.028), lymph vessel invasion (p = 0.021), and venous invasion (p = 0.03). Interestingly, a mutation in only exon 7 of the P53 gene was associated with lymph node metastasis. These results suggest the important effect of the mutations of the K-ras and p53 genes, especially p53 gene on colorectal carcinogenesis in Japanese patients. The grades of malignancy of the specimens with the mutations in both genes were not different significantly from those with a single (K-ras or p53) or no mutation, suggesting no cooperation between K-ras and p53 gene mutations on carcinogenesis or tumorigenesis",

    "Title": "An unexpected spectrum of p53 mutations from squamous cell carcinomas in psoriasis patients treated with PUVA",
    "Abstract": "Photochemotherapy employing 8-methoxypsoralen and long-wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVA, 320-400 nm) is widely used in the treatment of psoriasis. The photoactivation of psoralens in skin cells leads to formation of DNA photoadducts which may be responsible, at least in part, for the efficacy of these photochemotherapies. However, mutations arising from these adducts may also lead to the well-characterized increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma. Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been detected in many human cancers. To determine whether p53 mutations occur in squamous cell carcinomas in PUVA patients, PCR was used to amplify the exons (5-9) in which other studies have found a high frequency of point mutations. Gel electrophoresis was used to detect single-strand conformational polymorphisms. Aberrantly migrating bands were excised, reamplified and sequenced. Thirty-four specimens from 10 patients were examined. Specimens from one patient who had received no phototherapy as well as from normal controls were also analyzed. Five of the 10 patients showed at least one p53 mutation. In contrast to previously reported psoralen- induced p53 mutations in mice, the expected psoralen type mutations at alternating AT sites were not detected. All but two of the altered sequences occurred at dipyrimidine sites which is typical of solar type mutations. Two C-->T mutations and two dipyrimidine mutations (CC-->TT) were found. Other mutations included: C-->G, G-->T, C-->A and an 18 bp deletion. A review of therapeutic history of these patients showed that some had also received UVB phototherapy. Furthermore, because sunlight is thought to be beneficial for psoriasis, nontherapeutic, casual UVB exposure cannot be excluded. Our observations suggest that the SCC may have arisen from the solar mutations and that PUVA may enhance tumor progression or immune suppression",

    "Title": "Potential biomarkers in predicting progression of epithelial hyperplastic lesions of the larynx",
    "Abstract": "Factors contributing to malignant transformation of laryngeal pre- neoplastic lesions remain largely unknown. Potential etiologic factors may be related to a genetically controlled sensitivity to environmental carcinogens. In this study, we investigated bleomycin-induced chromosome fragility in 15 patients with laryngeal keratoses who experienced a malignant transformation of pre-neoplastic lesions during follow-up, as compared with chromosome fragility in 15 historical controls with no progression of laryngeal keratoses during a 10-year follow-up, in a match-paired analysis. Chromosomal analysis demonstrated a higher sensitivity to clastogens in patients with malignant progression of laryngeal pre-neoplastic lesions than that of control patients with no evolution of their original laryngeal keratoses (p < 0.01). Furthermore, in the attempt to identify possible prognostic markers we studied proliferative activity (MIB-1 expression) and p53 gene aberration in biopsy samples from non-invasive and invasive laryngeal lesions in both groups. p53 immunostaining was observed in 10/15 (66.7%) of pre-neoplastic lesions and in 11/15 (73.3%) of metachronous laryngeal cancers. No differences in terms of p53 expression were noted between transformed and not-transformed lesions. Mutations at p53 gene were observed in 3/15 (20%) of pre- invasive biopsies and in 4/5 (80%) of the laryngeal cancers analyzed. Our data suggest that p53 alteration is an early event in the genesis of a subset of laryngeal carcinomas and that there is no conclusive data about the possible clonal development of metachronous laryngeal carcinoma from a p53 mutated pre-invasive disease in the same patient. MIB-1 expression was found to progressively increase with degree of epithelial hyperplasia and dysplasia in both transformed (p = 0.007) and not-transformed (p < 0.1) lesions. Surprisingly, pre-invasive lesions with tumor evolution showed a lower proliferative activity when compared with laryngeal lesions without malignant transformation (p = 0.013). These data suggests that subjects with pre-neoplastic laryngeal lesion showing an increased susceptibility to carcinogens and with less proliferative disease could be at a higher risk for development of laryngeal carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Recent data suggest that deletion of p16INK4 and mutation of TP53 are among the most common genetic events in the development of human cancer, since the codified proteins act as brakes of the abnormal cell cycle. As the molecular events leading to the development of pediatric bone sarcomas remain unclear, we analyzed 75 osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma samples from 43 pediatric patients to search for alterations at the TP53 or p16INK4 tumor suppressor genes. By means of PCR-DGGE (polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) we detected TP53 point mutations in 18.6% of the tumor samples, but no constitutional mutations. In the analysis of p16INK4, 7% of the samples harbored deletions of the gene but no point mutations were detected by SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphism) analysis, just the polymorphism Ala-->Thr at codon 148. These data support the hypothesis that TP53 alterations may play a role in the development of pediatric bone tumors and that the primary mechanism of inactivation of p16INK4 seems to be homozygous deletion rather than point mutation",

    "Title": "Accumulation of wild-type p53 in astrocytomas is associated with increased p21 expression",
    "Abstract": "Approximately one quarter of human astrocytomas show immunohistochemical positivity for p53 protein but lack p53 gene mutations, which could reflect either an accumulation of wild-type p53 protein or an inadequate sensitivity of mutation detection. Since wild-type p53 up-regulates p21 expression, increased p21 expression in those astrocytomas with p53 accumulation in the absence of mutations would argue that the protein was wild type in these tumors. We therefore compared p21 expression with p53 gene and protein status in 48 primary human astrocytomas. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of the p53 gene showed mutations in 11 tumors (22.9%), while immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining in 19 cases (39.6%). Those tumors with p53 immunopositivity in the absence of p53 mutation had significantly increased p21 expression when compared to either mutant p53 or p53-immunonegative cases. Neither p53 nor p21 status correlated with proliferation indices, as assessed by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. These results support the hypotheses that functionally wild-type p53 accumulates in some astrocytomas, and that alternative cell cycle checkpoints (such as the p16 pathway) may be more important than p21 in regulating proliferation in astrocytomas",

    "Abstract": "The expression of the WAF1 gene was examined in the tissues of primary colorectal cancers and of adjacent non-neoplastic mucosas by Western blot analysis. p53 mutations of these cancer tissues were also analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism followed by direct sequencing. Missense mutations of p53 were recognized in 19 out of 40 cases. Five cancers (12.5%) displayed much lower expression of WAF1 than did their corresponding mucosas, and all of them contained mutant p53. Fourteen cancers (35%) expressed the same level of WAF1 as their mucosas, and 5 of them had mutant p53. Twenty-one cancers (52.5%) had much higher WAF1 expression than their mucosas, and 9 of them had mutant p53. When Duke's classification was applied to these colorectal cancers, it was found that the cancers with reduced expression of WAF1 basically coincided with late (C or D) stages (4 out of 5 cases), while the cancers with higher WAF1 expression were consistent with early (A or B) stages (17 out of 21 cases). Down-regulation of WAF1 in colorectal cancer tissues may be implicated in tumor progression",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations and expression of p53 and mdm2 proteins in invasive breast carcinoma. A comparative analysis with clinico-pathological factors",
    "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to analyze p53 gene mutations and the expression of p53 and mdm2 proteins in 31 randomly selected invasive breast carcinomas. The results were then correlated with tumor grade, stage, estrogen receptor status, nodal status, and DNA ploidy. The expression of the proteins p53 and mdm2 was determined immunohistochemically using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material. Screening for p53 mutation involved analysis of the highly conserved regions of the p53 gene (exons 5-9) by the polymerase chain reaction/ single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) technique. PCR products with band shifts were directly sequenced. Immunohistochemical staining of p53 was positive in 9 cases (29.0%), only 2 of which showed a p53 gene mutation. These were identified as a C-->G transversion at the second position of codon 278 in exon 8 and an A-->G transition at the second position of codon 205 in exon 6. A third case with a mutation was observed (C-->T transition, position 1 of codon 250 in exon 7) that did not show p53 immunohistochemically. Of the 9 p53- positive tumors, 2 were moderately differentiated (grade II). The remaining tumors were poorly differentiated (7/9). By contrast, p53- negative carcinomas were well differentiated (grade I) in most cases (P = 0.02). DNA cytometry in 8 of the 9 p53-positive carcinomas revealed an aneuploid stem line. The majority of the p53-negative tumors were diploid (P = 0.01). Mdm2 oncoprotein was detected in 10 tumors (32.2%), 4 of which were p53-positive, including the 3 with mutations. The grading of the mdm2-positive tumors was moderate or poor, G1 carcinomas were always noted to be mdm2-negative (P = 0.04). Overexpression of p53 protein is a complex mechanism and does not merely indicate the detection of mutations in the p53 gene. This study has shown that p53 expression correlates with tumor grade and DNA ploidy. Mdm2 expression was also associated with the tumor grade. Immunohistological demonstration of the p53 protein alone is insufficient as a basis for comment on the functional state of the p53 gene and gene product. The interrelation between recognition of the p53 protein and gene mutation needs more careful assessment to define their roles in the control of neoplasia",

    "Title": "Frequent loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 3p and 17p without VHL or p53 mutations suggests involvement of unidentified tumor suppressor genes in follicular thyroid carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) exhibits frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosomes 10q and 3p, suggesting involvement of tumor suppressor genes. We screened 14 FTC (10 Hurthle cell carcinomas and 4 nonoxyphilic FTC), 14 papillary thyroid carcinomas, and 7 follicular adenomas for LOH on chromosome arms 1p, 3p, 3q, 10p, 10q, 11p, 11q, 13q, 17p, and 17q. LOH was more frequent in FTC than in follicular adenoma or papillary thyroid carcinoma. In FTC, rates of LOH on 3p (86%), 17p (72%), and 10q (57%) were higher than the average rate of LOH (33%; P < 0.05). Most frequently involved were 3p21-25 and 17p13.1-13.3, the sites for the VHL (3p25-26) and p53 (17p13.1) tumor suppressors. We, therefore, characterized these genes by dideoxy fingerprinting and DNA sequencing. Two FTC had mutations in p53, but only 1 of these exhibited LOH at 17p. No VHL gene mutations were found. Thus, neither p53 nor VHL genes play a significant role in the pathogenesis of differentiated thyroid cancer. LOH on 17p, but not on 3p or 10q, was correlated with mortality. Accordingly, 3p and 10q LOH may represent early, and 17p LOH late, events in FTC development. The data suggest the presence of novel tumor suppressor genes on chromosomes 3p and 17p that may be important in the pathogenesis of FTC",

    "Abstract": "We have identified three unbalanced translocations involving chromosomes 5 and 17, der(5)t(5;17), der(17)t(5;17), and dic(5;17), in the malignant cells from 17 patients with myeloid neoplasms. Six patients had a primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) de novo; ten patients had therapy-related MDS and/or AML (t-MDS/t-AML), and one patient had chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast phase. Two of the six patients with MDS or AML de novo had extensive exposure to industrial solvents, and one patient had Seckel syndrome. The primary diagnoses for the ten patients with t- MDS/t-AML were breast carcinoma and Hodgkin's disease in two patients each, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ovarian carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma in one patient each. Four patients had received both prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy, four others received prior chemotherapy only, and the remaining two patients only prior radiotherapy. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of centromere-specific probes for chromosomes 5 and 17 revealed that a dicentric rearrangement was the most common (13/16 patients examined). The genetic consequences of these chromosomal rearrangements are partial monosomy for 5q and 17p. Two of six patients examined had point mutations in TP53, suggesting that loss of function of TP53 in addition to loss of a tumor suppressor gene on 5q may be involved in the pathogenesis of the malignant disease in some of these patients",

    "Abstract": "Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are chronic myeloproliferative disorders that may progress to acute leukemia in a subset of patients. This study aimed at investigating the genetic lesions associated with the blastic transformation of PV and ET. A panel of PV and ET cases at different stages of disease was analyzed for the presence of genetic alterations of TP53, NRAS, KRAS, and MDM2 by a combination of mutational analysis and Southern blot hybridization. The occurrence of microsatellite instability (MSI) was also tasted in selected cases. Samples of PV and ET analyzed in chronic phase disease were consistently devoid of all genetic lesions tested, suggesting that alterations of TP53, NRAS, KRAS, and MDM2 do not contribute significantly to development of chronic phase PV and ET. Conversely, mutations of TP53 were detected in 7/15 (46.6%) blastic phase cases, including 3/5 PV and 4/10 ET. In blastic phase patients for whom the corresponding chronic phase DNA was also available, it could be documented that the genetic lesion had arisen at the time of blastic transformation. In addition to TP53 mutations, cases of blastic phase PV and ET occasionally harbored mutations of NRAS (one case of blastic phase ET) or displayed MSI (one case of blastic phase PV). These data indicate that inactivation of TP53 is a relatively frequent event associated with the blastic transformation of PV and ET and may be responsible for the tumor progression of these disorders",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (WHO Grade IV), the most malignant neoplasm of the human nervous system, develops rapidly de novo (primary glioblastoma) or through progression from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma). We recently reported that mutations of the p53 gene are present in more than two-thirds of secondary glioblastomas but rarely occur in primary glioblastomas, suggesting the presence of different genetic pathways (Watanabe et al, Brain Pathol 1996:6:217-24). In the present study, primary and secondary glioblastomas were screened by immunohistochemistry for MDM2 overexpression and by differential PCR for gene amplification. Tumor cells immunoreactive to MDM2 were found in 15 of 29 primary glioblastomas (52%), but in only 3 of 27 secondary glioblastomas (11%; P=0.0015). MDM2 amplification occurred in 2 primary (7%) glioblastomas but in none of the secondary glioblastomas. Only one out of 15 primary glioblastomas overexpressing MDM2 contained a p53 mutation. These results suggest that MDM2 overexpression with or without gene amplification constitutes a molecular mechanism of escape from p53- regulated growth control, operative in the evolution of primary glioblastomas that typically lack p53 mutations",

Primary (de novo) glioblastomas are characterized by amplification/overexpression of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and, less frequently, of the MDM2 gene. Another pathway, operative in the progression of low-grade or anaplastic astrocytomas to secondary glioblastomas, is characterized by the frequent occurrence of p53 mutations. In this study, we assessed p53 mutations and EGFR expression in the giant cell glioblastoma. This rare variant is characterized by unusually large, multinucleated giant cells, but tends to be more confined and has been reported to carry a somewhat more favorable prognosis. We analyzed biopsies from 16 patients (mean age at clinical manifestation, 40 years). DNA sequencing revealed that 12 of 16 (75%) giant cell glioblastomas contained a p53 mutation. In 7 patients with two or more surgical interventions, the p53 mutation was already detected in the first biopsy. Focal EGFR overexpression, including multinucleated giant cells, was observed immunohistochemically in 9 of 16 (56%) tumors. However, most tumor areas lacked immunoreactivity, indicating that EGFR overexpression does not play a significant role in the evolution of this glioblastoma variant. These results suggest that giant cell glioblastomas develop de novo with a short preoperative history (mean, 47 +/- 40 days), but contain genetic alterations similar to those observed in secondary glioblastomas",

    "Title": "Determination of p53 mutations, EGFR overexpression, and loss of p16 expression in pediatric glioblastomas",
    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme is a rare neoplasm in children and is often located infratentorially, particularly in the brainstem: Pediatric glioblastomas arise frequently (here 60%) outside the cerebral hemispheres. We investigated 20 pediatric glioblastomas for mutational inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, loss of p16 protein expression and overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Mutations in the p53 gene were identified in 5/20 (25%) glioblastomas, 4 of which occurred in primary glioblastomas with a clinical history of less than 4 months and neither clinical nor histologic evidence of a less malignant precursor lesion. Loss of p16 expression was detected in 11/18 (61%) glioblastomas. Overexpression of the EGFR was infrequent (2/19, 11%) and included 1 tumor with a p53 mutation. Of 4 secondary glioblastomas that progressed from histologically diagnosed lower grade tumors, one contained a p53 mutation. Our results are at variance with similar studies in adult patients in which primary and secondary glioblastomas are characterized by EGFR overexpression and p53 mutations, respectively, suggesting that the evolution of pediatric glioblastomas follows different genetic pathways",

    "Title": "Genetic alterations of p16INK4a and p53 genes in sporadic dysplastic nevus",
    "Abstract": "It is still unclear whether the sporadic form of dysplastic nevi (SDN) represents a premalignant lesion of malignant melanoma and whether genetic alterations are involved in the development of SDN. To determine whether p16INK4a and p53 genetic abnormalities could be associated with development of SDN, nevus cell nests were procured selectively from H & E-stained slide sections by using a modified microdissection technique and were screened for the presence of mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of p16INK4a and p53 genes using a polymerase chain reaction-based LOH, single-strand conformation polymorphism, and direct DNA sequencing analyses. Hemizygous deletion was detected in 9 of 12 informative cases (75%) for 9p21-22 (p16INK4a) at one or more loci and 60% (6/10) for 17p13 (p53). As for mutation, we found 3 missense mutations and 1 mutation in the first intron in p16INK4a and 2 missense mutations in p53. Among these mutations in p16INK4a and p53, 5 of 6 mutations were of the C:G to T:A transitional type; this is known to be related to ultraviolet radiation as previously confirmed in other skin cancers. This indicates that p16INK4a and p53 genetic alterations may play an important role in the evolution of SDN and may represent an early event in the development of malignant melanoma. Furthermore, ultraviolet radiation might be the predominant etiologic agent in the development of SDN",

    "Title": "p53 alterations but no human papillomavirus infection in preinvasive and advanced squamous esophageal cancer in Italy",
    "Abstract": "Geographic differences in exposure to suspected carcinogens have been identified in esophageal carcinogenesis, and both p53 alterations and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection have been reported in esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESC) from high-risk areas, including China and South Africa. The status of p53 alterations and HPV infection in ESC has not been determined in northern Italy, where the incidence of ESC is low. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded esophageal samples containing normal, dysplastic, and carcinomatous tissue from 18 patients were examined for p53 protein accumulation with immunohistochemistry, p53 mutation (exons 5-8) with PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing, and HPV infection with PCR using general primers to amplify the L1 gene. Accumulation of p53 protein was observed in both precancerous and carcinomatous lesions. p53 mutations were rare in dysplastic lesions but were detected in 9 of 18 carcinomas, a finding consistent with reports from other geographic areas. Examination of the p53 mutation spectrum revealed no hot spot mutation. In contrast, HPV was not found in any of these 18 cases. This is consistent with the findings from other low ESC risk areas in which HPV infection may not play a crucial role in esophageal oncogenesis, whereas the high risk of ESC in China and South Africa may be attributed to frequent HPV infection",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in esophageal tumors from a high incidence area of China in relation to patient diet and smoking history",
    "Abstract": "Esophageal tumors from 29 patients residing in Guangzhou, China were examined for mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and for p53 protein accumulation in tumor cell nuclei. Anamnestic data for each patient, which included information on family history of cancer, tobacco smoking, drinking of alcoholic beverages, and dietary habits such as consumption of pickled vegetables, were recorded. Screening of DNA from tumor cells microdissected from biopsies was performed by PCR amplification of p53 gene exons 5-8, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis, and DNA sequencing. Mutations were identified in 20 of 29 tumors (69%). All tumors harboring a missense mutation in the p53 gene also showed nuclear accumulation of the tumor suppressor protein by immunohistochemistry. The most common p53 mutations in these tumors were guanine to adenine (G-->A) transitions (10 of 20 tumors; 50%). We did not find multiple mutations at codon 176, in contrast to Lung et al. in their recent study of esophageal cancer patients from Guangzhou (M. L. Lung et al., Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev., 5: 277-284, 1996). The mutation prevalence was high both in smokers (13 mutations in 20 smokers; 65%) and in nonsmokers (7 of 9 tumors with mutations; 78%), an observation that differs from that of studies in European and North American patients, which demonstrate a much higher prevalence of p53 mutations in smokers than in nonsmokers (reviewed in R. Montesano et al., Int. J. Cancer Predict. Oncol., 69: 225-235, 1996.). Our findings in this pilot study of tumor suppressor gene mutations in patients from Guangzhou support a large body of epidemiological observations pointing to dietary mutagenic carcinogens peculiar to populations in China at high risk of esophageal cancer",

    "Title": "A hot spot for p53 mutation in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder: clues to the etiology of bladder cancer",
    "Abstract": "Twenty-eight transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder, grade 2 or 3, were analyzed for the presence of p53 mutations. Thirteen tumors were found to contain 14 mutations. These were all base substitution mutations, of which nine were GC-->AT transitions (three at CpG sites). The remaining five mutations were transversions (three GC-->CG, one GC-- >TA, and one AT-->TA). Four of the mutations were found at codon 280. A comparison with other studies of bladder tumors reveals that a region encompassing codons 280 and 285 represents a hot spot for p53 mutation in bladder cancer. The 280/285 hot spot lies within two purine-rich sequences that may provide some clues to the identity of potential bladder carcinogens. A comparison of mutations from bladder tumors of smokers and nonsmokers reveals no significant differences",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in head and neck cancer: new data and evaluation of mutational spectra.",
    "Abstract": "It has been suggested that the frequency, type, and location of p53 mutations (mutational spectra) can be linked to specific exogenous and endogenous carcinogenic agents and processes. Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) provides an excellent tumor model to evaluate the utility of the p53 mutational spectra, given that it has well-defined and strong risk factors (tobacco and alcohol). The purpose of this analysis was to establish the pattern of p53 mutations in SCCHN and evaluate this mutational spectrum in comparison to the spectra for other cancers with similar and different risk factors, including cancers of the esophagus, lung, and colon. p53 mutational data were obtained from head and neck tumors collected at the University of North Carolina Hospitals and the published literature. A total of 14 of 33 tumors from the University of North Carolina Hospitals (42%) were found to have a p53 mutation. The alterations included three transversions, seven transitions, two deletions, and two suspected codon 47 polymorphisms. In general, SCCHN and esophageal cancer share a similar mutational pattern in contrast to colon cancer. These two aerodigestive tract cancers were statistically different from lung cancer, despite sharing tobacco as a major risk factor. For example, G--&gt;T transversions, a mutation type considered to be characteristic of exogenous DNA-damaging agents including tobacco smoke carcinogens, varied among tobacco-related cancer sites (14% SCCHN, 11% esophageal, and 31% lung) in contrast to colon cancer (6%). The comparison of mutational spectra for SCCHN and other cancers indicates that the effects of both tobacco and alcohol exposure may yield a pattern of p53 mutations that reflects elements of both exogenous and endogenous exposures",

    "Abstract": "A mutational spectrum for exons 5-8 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in colorectal carcinomas in Hong Kong Chinese was established. Ninety-nine colorectal carcinomas from Hong Kong patients were analyzed for mutations in p53 gene by PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing. Thirty-five of the 99 tumors (35.4%) contained mutations. Point mutations accounted for 80% of all genetic changes and were predominantly base transitions at CpG dinucleotide sites, mutations that were also predominant in Caucasian carcinomas. The major hot spots at codons 175 and 248 of p53 in Caucasians are also hot spots in the Chinese gene. Identical mutations in codons 152 and 306 were detected in two independent tumors in the Chinese, which were reported only rarely in Caucasians. Moreover, a significantly higher frequency (20%) of deletion and insertion mutations was observed in Hong Kong colorectal cancer patients. Distinct genetic and/or environmental factors may contribute to these findings",

    "Title": "Immunohistochemical and mutational analysis of the p53 tumour suppressor gene and the bcl-2 oncogene in primary testicular germ cell tumours",
    "Abstract": "The role of p53 in testicular germ cell tumours is still contradictory based on the finding of immunohistochemical overexpression at the protein level, but lack of mutations at the DNA level. In addition, p53 wild-type activity has been demonstrated in cell culture experiments. Overexpression of the proto-oncogene bcl-2 might block p53-induced apoptosis and might inhibit p53 functional activity. To clarify the apparent paradox with respect to p53 overexpression and lack of mutations, an immunohistochemical and mutational analysis of p53 and bcl-2 in TGCT was performed. Ten normal testes, 52 CIS and 151 clinical stage I nonseminomatous GCTs were included in our study. A commercially available anti-p53 polyclonal rabbit antibody and an anti-bcl-2-mouse monoclonal antibody were used to stain the 5pm sections. Staining was assessed by counting at least 500 cells from the area of the most intense staining in each tumour cell type, and this was scored semiquantitatively for intensity of staining on a 4 point scale. In addition, 30 primary GCTs were included in the mutational analysis: areas with p53 overexpression were identified and microdissected prior to DNA extraction. p53 exons 5-8 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Templates demonstrating band shifts on SSCP were subjected to direct DNA sequence analysis. None of the normal testes, 32/52 (62%) CIS, and 142/151 (94%) germ cell tumours exhibited p53 overexpression. p53 expression was significantly lower in mature teratomas (0.8 +/- 0.2) than in other germ cell tumour components (2.8 +/- 1.2, p > 0.001). PCR-SSCP did not reveal any missense mutations or deletions for the p53 gene. Bcl-2 protein expression was observed in none of the normal testes, in none of the CIS, and in 14/151 (9.3%) germ cell tumours. 13/14 germ cell tumours demonstrated bcl-2 expression only in the glandular and stromal elements of their teratomatous components whereas all other components were negative for bcl-2. Our results--p53 overexpression, lack of p53 mutations, undetectable bcl-2--are consistent with recent in vitro studies. High susceptibility of testicular cancer to drug-induced apoptosis appears to be the result of wild-type p53 and lack of bcl-2. Radiation and chemotherapeutic insensitivity of mature teratomas might be the result of bcl-2 overexpression and lack of p53 overexpression. Therefore, chemoresistance to DNA damaging agents might be reflected by the expression of p53 and bcl-2 and it might be useful to evaluate p53 and bcl-2 in primary tumours and metastatic lesions in order to identify patients early with primary or secondary chemoresistance",

    "Title": "The establishment of a preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma using cell specimens from pancreatic duct brushing with special attention to p53 mutations",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previously, the authors reported that 82% of cases of pancreatic carcinoma were positive for p53 in cytologic specimens obtained by selective endoscopic pancreatic duct brushing (SEPB). However, there was an extreme discrepancy between the authors' data of p53 overexpression using cytologic specimens and other reports using surgically resected specimens. In this study, the authors demonstrate that p53 positive cells precisely reflect its gene mutations, and also establish systematic procedures for the preoperative diagnosis of patients with pancreatic carcinoma. METHODS: The authors examined 44 cases of pancreatic carcinoma, 30 cases of chronic pancreatitis, and 9 cases of papillary adenoma. In all cases, pathologic diagnosis was made by surgery or autopsy. The conventional cytology and p53 immunocytology were performed simultaneously in the cell specimens obtained by SEPB. In the cases immunostained for p53, DNA was extracted selectively from p53 immunostained cells using a light microscope. p53 mutations in exons 5 to 8 were examined by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Forty of 44 pancreatic carcinomas (91%) were diagnosed correctly by the methods of conventional cytology associated with p53 immunocytology. p53 mutations were detected in 12 of 14 cases that were positive for p53 (86%). Four of six cases that were inoperable due to massive metastasis or invasion had the mutation at codon 273 (CGT to CAT) in exon 8. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that p53 immunocytology reflects its gene mutations precisely, and that the point mutation at codon 273 (CGT to CAT) of p53 may play an important role in the invasive potential and metastasis of pancreatic carcinoma",

    "Title": "p53 sequence analysis predicts treatment response and outcome of patients with esophageal carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The ability to predict biologic behavior and treatment responsiveness would be a valuable asset in the multimodality approach to esophageal carcinoma. The authors examined whether alterations of the p53 gene correlate with clinicopathologic parameters, response to preoperative chemotherapy/radiotherapy, and outcome in patients with esophageal carcinoma. METHODS. Histopathologic/genetic analysis of p53 was performed on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues. Tissue sections were stained immunohistochemically for p53 protein followed by topographic genotyping comprised of polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing of p53 exons 5-8. All patients received induction chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and alpha- interferon) and concurrent external beam radiotherapy (4500 centigrays) followed by resection. RESULTS: p53 analysis performed on 42 tumors from patients with potentially resectable esophageal carcinoma revealed 25 of the 42 tumors (59.5%) to be p53 immunopositive; however, only 17 of the 42 tumors (40.5%) were proven to contain p53 point mutational damage in exons 8 (n=5), 5 (n=5), 7 (n=4), and 6 (n=3). Eight cases were weakly immunopositive and had no genotype mutation suggesting hyperexpression of normal wild-type p53. Genotyping also identified two immunonegative cases with deletion-type mutations (exons 5 and 6). Tissue samples collected before and after chemotherapy/radiotherapy exhibited fidelity in p53 mutational genotype in all cases. The presence of a p53 point mutation positively correlated with pTNM stage (P=0.003) and residual disease in the resected specimen (P=0.01). Moreover, survival of patients with p53 mutations was significantly lower than that of patients without mutations (overall survival of 21.6 months vs. 40 months; P=0.0038; and disease free survival of 14.1 months vs. 38 months; P=0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: Histopathologic/genetic analysis is a better determinant of p53 mutational damage than immunohistochemistry alone and can be used as a prognostic marker for esophageal carcinoma. p53 genotyping may define a subset of patients who respond to chemotherapy/radiotherapy and may predict who potentially benefits from multimodality therapy",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several lines of evidence indicate that there is a close association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of the virus itself in the development of the disease is not yet well understood. METHODS: In liver samples from 15 anti-HCV positive Caucasian patients with HCC, the authors searched for the presence and genomic characteristics of the infecting virus, and also analyzed the p53 gene by single strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing of abnormal bands. RESULTS: In all cases but one, HCV RNA was detected in nonneoplastic liver tissue, whereas in neoplastic tissue, viral sequences were detected in 6 of 6 samples containing moderately differentiated HCC (Edmondson grades I- II) and in 2 of 9 containing poorly differentiated HCC (Edmondson grade III) (P=0.007). Seventy-three percent of the cases were infected by genotype 1 and 20% by genotype 2, whereas the liver cells of 1 patient with a previous history of hepatitis B infection were HCV RNA negative. p53 mutations, observed in 2 patients, consisted of a G-to-A transition at codon 176 of exon 5 in 1 patient and a G-to-T transversion at codon 287 of exon 8 in the other. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that HCV may contribute to liver tumor development during the early stages of carcinogenesis, whereas p53 gene mutations were detected only in 2 of 15 patients in this cohort",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have indicated that environmental and personal habits, particularly tobacco use and alcohol abuse, are major etiologic factors in the induction and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Molecular studies have focused on HNSCC related to smoking but not those associated with smokeless tobacco. METHODS: The authors studied immunohistochemical evidence of alterations of p53, cyclin D1, and Rb in 34 human oral carcinomas related to tobacco use. They also examined p53 and H-ras using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing analysis. RESULTS: Overexpression of cyclin D1 was found in 41% of cases, and accumulation of p53 was found in 59%. Only 9% of the samples did not show Rb staining. In SSCP and sequencing analysis, 17 cases showed mutations in the conserved region of the p53 gene. No mutations were detected in codons 12, 13, or 61 of the H-ras gene. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of cyclin D1 and p53 mutations are common alterations in HNSCC. In contrast, the loss of Rb function seems to occur infrequently, and mutations in the H-ras gene apparently do not play a role in this cancer. HNSCC associated with smokeless tobacco contained the same alterations as those related to smoking",

    "Title": "Very frequent p53 mutations in metastatic prostate carcinoma and in matched primary tumors",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The frequency of mutant p53 in bone marrow metastases of patients with carcinoma of the prostate (CaP) and in matched sets of metastatic and primary lesions from the same patients was investigated. The data were examined in relation to prior treatment with androgen ablation (AA) therapy and were compared with the frequency of mutant p53 reported for primary CaP. METHODS: Seventeen patients with M1b (bone metastasis: TNM Stage IV) CaP had either unilateral or bilateral bone marrow biopsies taken for these studies. Specimens were divided and the outer one-third examined histologically to confirm the presence of CaP cells. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for accumulated p53 protein was performed by an antibody cocktail technique. RNA was extracted from the remaining portion of the biopsy, and p53 transcripts were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) and screened for base sequence changes in the exon 4-11 region using nonisotopic single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Ten of 17 metastases (59%) demonstrated accumulation of p53. Six of 7 (86%) of the p53 IHC positive bone marrow samples contained RT-PCR-SSCP abnormalities, as did 2 of 3 IHC negative samples. Overall, 12 of 17 metastases (71%) contained mutant p53. Four of 7 biopsies (57%) retrieved prior to AA contained mutant p53, whereas 8 of 10 post-AA biopsies (80%) contained mutant p53. One patient showed identical SSCP abnormalities in right and left iliac crest metastases after therapy, and in this patient DNA sequencing demonstrated a missense mutation at codon 126 (TAC --> GGC, Tyr --> Gly). Archival primary cancers from seven patients were retrieved. All seven were IHC positive for p53 accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations are associated with increased metastatic potential of CaP. Abnormalities are found at approximately twice the frequency in metastases than in unselected samples of primary CaP, whereas in matched specimens there is a high rate of consonance. Mutant p53 may contribute to systemic therapy resistance, due to increased association with post-AA CaP specimens",

    "Abstract": "AIMS: Circumstantial evidence suggests that genetic changes may lead to tumor progression within the myxoid liposarcoma tumors (MLTs) carrying non-random chromosomal translocation t(12;16). METHODS: To address this subject an immunophenotypic analysis, applying antibodies against proteins encoded by TP53, MDM2 and CDK4 genes, complemented by molecular analysis of eight suitable cases, was performed on 104 consecutive cases. Chromosomal translocations were assessed either by cytogenetic analysis or by RT-PCR in 9 suitable cases and chimeric transcripts were found in all cases but two pleomorphic liposarcomas. RESULTS: Based on immunophenotyping and tumor site, the case material consisted of three groups. The first one was made up of 92 non- retroperitoneal cases carrying a null p53, mdm2, cdk4 immunophenotype, which remained unchanged over the time of recurrences and along the gamut of histologic subtypes. The second group was represented by five p53+, mdm2-, cdk4- non-retroperitoneal cases, 4 of which were further analysed by PCR-SSCP for p53 mutation. The immunophenotypic profile of these cases, complemented by the molecular findings, supported a role of TP53 in tumor progression in three high-grade MLTs. The third group, consisting of 7 retroperitoneal cases, showed a heterogeneous immunophenotype, sharing immunophenotypic and molecular features with the well-differentiated/evoluted (dedifferentiated) liposarcoma group. CONCLUSIONS: TP53 mutations seem to play a role in tumor progression in a few cases of MLTs (2.8%) showing more aggressive histologic characteristics. The unexpected finding that a number of retroperitoneal LMTs display the immunophenotypic profile of the well differentiated/evoluted (dedifferentiated) liposarcomas, deserves further investigation",

    "Title": "p53 tumour suppressor gene mutations in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To identify and analyse point mutations in p53 tumour suppressor gene (Tp53) in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) and sequence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 141 tissue specimens (approx. 100 mg) after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), 12 specimens after needle biopsy. Control samples for genetic analysis were (a) 7 prostate tissues without any sign of BPH and malignancy and (b) 103 prostate cancer (PCa) tissues. DNA of the critical Tp53 exons 5-8 was amplified and run on horizontal polyacrylamide gels under defined temperature conditions (TGGE) to yield specific gel shifts and sets of homo- and heteroduplexes in case of mutation. Sequencing with a laser-fluorescent electrophoresis unit was done from re-amplified mutant and wild-type bands. RESULTS: TGGE screening of 153 BPH samples identified 29 specimens with Tp53 mutations (5 in exon 5, 11 in exon 6, 12 in exon 7, 3 in exon 8; 1 tissue sample showed mutations in 3 exons at a time). The computed mutation frequency was 19.0%. Two patients, with mutation in BPH tissue, developed PCa 2-3 years after TURP. One patient with mutation in BPH tissue developed bladder cancer. Of 118 patients with non-mutated DNA in BPH, none is known to have a urological cancer. The Tp53 mutation frequency in 103 PCa samples was 26.2%. Significant differences of mutation frequency between BPH and PCa were detected only in lower exon 5 mutation counts in BPH. CONCLUSION: Tp53 mutation in BPH tissue may be a tumour risk factor",

    "Title": "FHIT and p53 gene abnormalities in bronchioloalveolar carcinomas. Correlations with clinicopathological data and K-ras mutations",
    "Abstract": "Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is a particular type of adenocarcinoma of the lung which accounts for up to 9 per cent of pulmonary malignancies. The aetiology and pathogenesis of this unique neoplastic disease are still unclear. Three histological subtypes of BAC have been recognized: mucinous, non-mucinous, and sclerosing. Of these, mucinous and sclerosing BAC have a worse prognosis than non- mucinous tumours. The different morphological patterns and clinical outcomes of the subtypes of BAC suggest differences in their biological behaviour. Previous reports have shown that the mucinous form of BAC is characterized by constant mutations at codon 12 of the K-ras gene, whereas the other two histotypes show a frequency of K-ras mutations which is not different from that observed in conventional lung adenocarcinomas. The present study of a series of 51 BACs, previously investigated for K-ras gene mutations, has evaluated the status of two other genes, p53 and FHIT, known to be frequently altered in non-small cell lung cancer. Loss of heterozygosity at microsatellite-containing loci located within the FHIT gene was observed in 22 (43 per cent) BACs. The distribution of FHIT gene abnormalities was not statistically different in the three histological subtypes. p53 mutations were present in 13 (32 per cent) non-mucinous/sclerosing BACs, while no mutations were seen in mucinous tumours (P = 0.039). Correlations with clinicopathological parameters showed that p53 mutations in BACs are associated with more aggressive tumours. No correlations were observed between FHIT or K-ras gene abnormalities and clinicopathological data. In conclusion, these results indicate that FHIT alterations are frequently involved in BAC tumourigenesis and that genetic changes in the p53 and K-ras genes can distinguish between different histotypes of BAC",

    "Title": "Frequent p53 gene mutations in serrated adenomas of the colorectum",
    "Abstract": "Serrated adenoma has been recently proposed as a distinct histological lesion of the colorectum. This study examined p53 immunoreactivity, mutations of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene, codon 12 of the Ki-ras gene by PCR-SSCP analyses, and microsatellite instability in 19 serrated adenomas, ten adenocarcinomas in/with serrated adenomas, 23 hyperplastic nodules, four hyperplastic polyps and 29 tubular adenomas of the colorectum. Eleven of 11 (100 per cent) serrated adenomas had p53 immunoreactivity and all six (100 per cent) adenocacinomas in/with serrated adenomas exhibited moderate to severe p53 immunoreactivity. It was confirmed that 9 of 19 (47 per cent) serrated adenomas and 5 of 10 (50 per cent) adenocarcinomas in/with serrated adenomas harboured p53 gene mutations. On the other hand, no p53 gene mutation was detected in the other colorectal lesions. Meanwhile, 11 (58 per cent) serrated adenomas and six (60 per cent) adenocarcinomas in/with serrated adenomas had Ki-ras gene mutations, as also did 9 of 23 (39 per cent) hyperplastic nodules, 3 of 4 (75 per cent) hyperplastic polyps, and 12 of 29 (41 per cent) tubular adenomas. Microsatellite instability was detected in one (5 per cent) serrated adenoma and one (10 per cent) adenocarcinoma in a serrated adenoma. The other lesions did not show microsatellite instability. Serrated adenomas had significantly frequent p53 gene mutations compared with hyperplastic lesions or tubular adenomas (p < 0.005). On the other hand, they did not exhibit significant differences in mutations of the Ki-ras gene or in microsatellite instability. Genetic changes were then examined in small parts of serrated adenomas, such as the upper or lower parts of crypts, to determine the extent of gene mutations by using a microdissection technique. Exon 15 of the APC gene and the DCC gene, in addition to the p53 and Ki-ras genes and microsatellite instability, were analysed. Identical mutations of the p53 gene were found in both invasive adenocarcinomas and adjacent serrated adenomas by direct sequencing, suggesting single clonal origins for those lesions. Mutations of the APC gene and microsatellite instability were heterogeneous in some lesions. No loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the DCC gene was found. These findings suggest that mutations of the p53 gene are the most characteristic genetic alterations in serrated adenomas, as a relatively early event in a multistep carcinogenic pathway of this type of colorectal lesion, that might be distinct from the ordinary adenoma- carcinoma sequence or from carcinogenesis via mutations of mismatch repair genes",

    "Title": "Pancreatic endocrine tumours: evidence for a tumour suppressor pathogenesis and for a tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 17p",
    "Abstract": "Two molecular pathways leading to cancer are known. Common-type cancers arise from the 'tumour suppressor' pathway, characterized by gross chromosomal changes and allelic losses (LOH) in an average of 25 per cent or more of randomly chosen chromosomal loci. The 'mutator pathway' has been recognized in a subset of cancers, characterized by widespread microsatellite DNA instability and rarity of chromosomal losses. The present study has investigated 20 pancreatic endocrine tumours (PETs) for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at seven chromosomal loci (3p14, 7q31- 32, 11q13, 13q14, 18q21, 17p13, and 17q21); microsatellite instability; and Ki-ras, N-ras, and p53 gene mutations. LOH was found in an average of 24 per cent of the chromosomal loci analysed. No tumour showed microsatellite instability. Ki-ras and p53 mutations were each found in one case. The frequency of losses was higher in malignant (40 per cent) than in benign (17 per cent) tumours (p = 0.009), and the specific chromosome 17p13 LOH was associated with extrapancreatic extension of disease (p = 0.007), high proliferative activity (p = 0.001), and absence of progesterone receptors (p = 0.01). A common deleted region on chromosome 17p13 and the rarity of p53 gene mutations suggest the existence of a novel tumour suppressor gene involved in the pathogenesis of PETs in this chromosomal area",

    "Abstract": "We examined chromosomes and mutations of the N-RAS and TP53 genes in 73 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Twenty-six patients showed a reciprocal chromosomal translocation or an inversion, and 34 patients showed only unbalanced aberrations. Balanced aberrations were predominantly detected in the AML patients who did not have myelodysplasia, preceding myelodysplastic syndrome, and a history of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In contrast, unbalanced aberrations were more frequently seen in the patients with AML with trilineage myelodysplasia, AML transformed from MDS, and therapy-related AML. Twenty-two mutations of the N-RAS and TP53 genes were detected, and these mutations were frequently associated with unbalanced chromosomal aberrations. Furthermore, the spectrum of mutations was suggestive of an exposure to alkylating chemicals",

    "Title": "RAS, FMS and p53 mutations and poor clinical outcome in myelodysplasias: a 10-year follow-up",
    "Abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying the development and evolution of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are largely unknown. The increasing number of blast cells in the bone marrow correlate with poor prognosis and risk of developing acute leukemia. Such progression is frequently associated with increasing chromosomal abnormalities and genetic mutations. A cohort of 75 MDS patients were investigated for RAS, FMS and p53 mutations, and these molecular findings were related to cytogenetics, clinical status, transformation to acute leukemia, prognostic scores and survival. A mutation incidence of 57% (43/75) was found, with 48% (36/75) RAS mutations, 12% (9/75) FMS mutations and 8% (4/50) p53 mutations. The mutation status for RAS and FMS was related to MDS subgroup, increasing with poor-risk disease. The highest incidence was in the chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) subgroup. The most frequent RAS mutations were of codon 12 and a predominance of FMS codon 969 mutations was observed. A statistically significant increased frequency of transformation to AML was observed in MDS patients harboring RAS or FMS mutations (P < 0.02). Patients with oncogene mutations had a significantly poorer survival compared with those without mutations at 2 years and at the end of the period of follow-up (P < 0.02). Multivariate analysis including mutation, age, gender, diagnosis (FAB), cytogenetics and International score shows that the International score and mutation and age is the best predictive model of a poor outcome, (P < 0.0001). When the analysis was undertaken without the International score, mutation and gender was the best predictor of poor survival (P = 0.005). This study shows that oncogene mutation, indicative of genetic instability, is associated with disease progression and poor survival in MDS",

    "Abstract": "Mantle cell lymphomas (MCL) are morphologically and immunophenotypically distinctive lymphoid neoplasms characterised by overexpression of cyclin D1. Recent studies have suggested that co- operating aberrations of cell cycle associated genes may provide a growth advantage to a tumour. To address this issue further, we investigated five typical and three aggressive (blastoid) MCL for alterations in the cell cycle regulating genes p15, p16, CDK4, Rb and p53. In 3/3 aggressive cases with cyclin D1 overexpression we found aberration of at least one additional gene. One case showed diminished expression of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb); one case harboured deletion of both p15 and p16; and one case exhibited both deletion of p16 and point mutation of p53. However, we also identified two typical cases which in addition to cyclin D1 overexpression exhibited diminished pRb expression and p15 and p16 hypermethylation, respectively. Our findings confirm and extend other recent investigations and indicate that co-operating genetic alterations of cell cycle-associated genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of MCL",

    "Title": "Sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with a mutant p53 phenotype and absence of Bcl-2 expression",
    "Abstract": "Fas (APO-1/CD95) is a cell-surface protein that can mediate apoptosis upon specific ligand or antibody binding. The Bcl-2 protein may function as a modulator of Fas-induced apoptosis by blocking a downstream activation step, and Bcl-2 expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells appears to depend partly on expression of a wild- type (wt) p53 tumor suppressor gene (Findley et al, Blood 1997; 89: 2986). We therefore investigated the relationship between sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis and (1) Fas expression, (2) p53 status, and (3) Bcl-2 protein levels in pediatric ALL cell lines and primary leukemic cells. Cell lines included 21 B cell precursor (BCP)-ALL and four T-ALL lines; in five cases, cryopreserved primary leukemic cells from which these lines were established were also examined. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of anti-Fas monoclonal antibody on the activation of protease CPP32 and induction of apoptosis in these lines. By SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing, we detected p53 mutations (mt) in eight out of 25 ALL cell lines (exon-7, codon 248 n=6; exon-8, codon 273, n=2). The expression of Fas and Bcl-2 was examined by immunofluorescence staining and quantified as the number of molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF). Elevated levels of Fas were expressed in all six lines with a mutation of p53 in codon 248 (1500 to 10800 MESF). Although Fas was detectable in seven of the 17 lines with wt-p53, expression was lower (150-900 MESF) compared with mt-p53+ lines. Bcl-2 was expressed in 10 of the 25 lines. Most (9/10) wt-p53+ lines expressed Bcl-2, whereas only one of eight mt-p53+ lines and no p53-null lines expressed this protein. Treatment of Fas-positive lines with anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (200 ng/ml) for 6 h induced activation of CPP32 and apoptosis in eight of 13 Fas+ lines. Sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis was associated with a mt-p53 phenotype and absence of Bcl-2 expression. Six of eight Fas+/Fas- sensitive (S) lines were mt-53+/Bcl-2-, whereas only two Fas+/Fas-S lines were wt-p53+/Bcl-2+; both of these latter lines expressed low levels of Bcl-2 compared to Fas-resistant lines. In contrast, four of five Fas+/Fas-resistant (R) lines were wt-p53+/Bcl-2+; the exception was p53-null/Bcl-2- but expressed a low level of Fas (150 MESF). Activation of the cysteine protease CPP32 and cleavage of its substrate poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) was also detected in Fas-S but not Fas-R lines. We obtained similar results from both the primary leukemic cells and the corresponding cell lines in five cases: overexpression of Fas and Fas-sensitivity were present in mt-p53+/Bcl-2- but not wt- p53+/Bcl-2+ cells. These results suggest that some pediatric ALL cells expressing mt-p53+ may be sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis due to high levels of Fas expression and lack of Bcl-2, and further suggest that molecular methods of activating Fas may be useful for therapy of refractory ALL with the Fas+/mt-p53+ phenotype",

    "Title": "Human male germ cell tumor resistance to cisplatin is linked to TP53 gene mutation",
    "Abstract": "Male germ cell tumors (GCTs) are uniquely sensitive to cisplatin-based chemotherapy, with more than 90% of newly diagnosed cases cured. The underlying cause for resistance to treatment in 20-30% of metastatic lesions remains to be identified. Unlike other solid tumors, no mutations in the TP53 gene have been identified to date in random panels of GCT specimens, which could account for the exquisite sensitivity of these tumors to genotoxic insult. However, in a panel of resistant GCTs that did either not respond to cisplatin-based chemotherapy or subsequently relapsed and resulted in the death of the patient, we have now identified a subset of tumors to contain TP53 mutations within exons 6-9. A cell line derived from one of these tumors (228A) displayed the same TP53 mutation as the tumor specimen, expressed only mutant TP53 mRNA, and exhibited a relative resistance to cisplatin in vitro in comparison to a cell line (218A) derived from a responsive tumor with wild-type TP53. The resistant cell line displayed a much reduced apoptotic cell death and did not exhibit an induction of transcription of the p53-responsive genes WAF1 and MDM2 following cisplatin treatment, compared to that observed in the sensitive cell line. The levels of bax, an agonist of apoptosis, were found to be reduced in the resistant cell line. The simplest explanation for the resistance of this subset of GCTs that are resistant to cisplatin-based chemotherapy, is the inability of the cells to mount an apoptotic response following exposure due to a functionally inactivating mutation in the TP53 gene",

    "Title": "High incidence of loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 17p13 in breast tumours from BRCA2 mutation carriers",
    "Abstract": "Breast tumours from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers are genetically instable and display specific patterns of chromosomal aberrations, suggestive of distinct genetic pathways in tumour progression. The frequency of abnormalities affecting chromosome 17p and the TP53 gene was determined in 27 breast tumours from 26 female patients carrying the Icelandic BRCA2 founder mutation (999del5). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was detected in 23 of the 27 tumours (85%). The majority of tumours manifesting LOH had lost a large region on 17p, although a more restricted loss, including the TP53 locus was seen in a few tumours. Positive p53 immunostaining was observed in 18 of 26 tumours (69%). However, mutations in the TP53 gene were detected in only three tumours (11%), including a missense (codon 139) and a nonsense mutation (codon 306) in two tumours with moderate p53 expression and a frameshift deletion (codon 182) in a tumour with no detectable p53 expression. Positive p53 immunostaining, mainly weak, was observed in 16 of the 24 tumours (66%) without TP53 mutation. The high frequency of LOH at chromosome 17p13 suggests that one or more genes from this region are involved in the development of BRCA2-induced breast cancer. The frequent finding of weak overexpression of, presumably wild type p53 protein, suggests an alternative mechanism of TP53 involvement specific to these tumours",

    "Title": "Mutations in exon 7 and 8 of p53 as poor prognostic factors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "This study was performed to clarify the different effects of each mutant exon of p53 as indicators of a poor prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tumor tissues of 204 patients with NSCLC were analysed; 96 tumors were stage I, 22 stage II, and 86 stage III. DNA was extracted from frozen specimens and polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing were performed to investigate mutations of p53 from exon 5 to exon 8. Seventy-five patients with NSCLC (36.8%) had mutations in p53 which included 72 cases of missense mutations and three cases of non-missense mutations. The overall survival rate of patients with mutant p53 adenocarcinomas was strikingly worse than that of patients whose tumors had wild-type p53 (35.7% vs 53.8%; P=0.041), but no significant difference in survival was found in the patients with NSCLC and squamous cell carcinoma. Mutations in exon 5 of p53 occurred in 33 cases (16.2%), mutation in exon 6 was detected in only one case (0.5%), mutations in exon 7 in 20 cases (9.8%), and mutations in exon 8 in 18 cases (8.8%). The overall survival rate of patients with mutations in exon 7 was worse than that of patients with wild-type p53 in NSCLCs and adenocarcinomas (42.9% vs 56.0%; P=0.025 and 33.3% vs 53.8%; P=0.048, respectively), whereas the overall survival of patients with mutations in exon 5 was almost the same as that of patients with wild-type p53. In addition, the overall survival rate of patients with mutations in exon 8 was strikingly worse than that of patients with wild-type p53 in NSCLCs, adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas (22.9% vs 56.0%; P<0.001, 19.0% vs 53.8%; P=0.004 and 33.3% vs 62.5%; P=0.042, respectively). Multivariate analysis with the Cox regression model of patients with NSCLC, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma indicated that mutations in exon 8 were best correlated with the overall survival rate, followed by lymph node status (P<0.001, P=0.015 and P=0.006, respectively), and mutations in exon 7 of NSCLC were also revealed to have good correlation, followed by lymph node status and mutations in exon 8 (P=0.031). Mutation of p53 was a poor prognostic factor for adenocarcinoma as described previously. Moreover, mutations in exon 8 were more useful indicators of prognosis not only for adenocarcinoma but also for NSCLC. Worse overall survival of the patients with mutations in exon 8 of p53 was suggested to be associated with codon 273 mutations as well as mutations between codon 280 and 285 included into the H2 alpha helix corresponding to residues 278-286. These results suggested that abnormal conformation of H2 alpha helix might play an important role not only in the loss of normal function but also in the acquisition of tumorigenesis. Investigation of mutations in exon 8, especially codon 273 mutation and mutant H2 alpha helix was considered to be a clinically useful approach for determining the prognosis of patients with NSCLC",

    "Title": "A transforming p53 mutant, which binds DNA, transactivates and induces apoptosis reveals a nuclear:cytoplasmic shuttling defect",
    "Abstract": "The DG75 Burkitt lymphoma-derived human B cell line is heterozygous for p53, carrying wild type (WT) and mutant (Arg283His) alleles. The cells constitutively express high levels of both p53 proteins and also Mdm2. Arg283His transactivates the p21Waf1, Mdm2, bax, cyclin G and IGF-BP3 promoters in transient transfection assays equally as well as, if not better than WT p53. It also suppresses the outgrowth of SAOS-2 cells and specifically binds DNA like wild type protein. However, in primary rodent fibroblasts Arg283His fails to suppress transformation by HPV16- E7 and (Ha-)ras and even has modest transforming activity when transfected alone with (Ha-)ras. When Arg283His is transiently transfected into SAOS-2 cells it efficiently induces apoptosis, so - unlike mutants such as Arg175Pro - its behaviour in transformation assays does not clearly correlate with loss of the apoptosis function. Immunofluorescence staining of both REF transformants and transiently transfected SAOS-2 revealed that this unusual mutant becomes excluded from the nucleus and produces striking cytoplasmic fluorescence. The best correlation with transformation, therefore, appears to be the lack of nuclear retention of Arg283His. Since this mutation does not map to any known nuclear localization signal and its presence seems to result in aberrant exclusion from the nucleus, then it may prove very useful in exploring mechanisms involved in the nuclear:cytoplasmic shuttling of p53",

    "Title": "Potential role for wild-type p53 in leukemias with MLL gene translocations",
    "Abstract": "We used single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of p53 exons 4-8 to screen for possible mutations in 25 pediatric de novo leukemias with translocations of the MLL gene at chromosome band 11q23. Of the 25 patients, 21 were infants. Fifteen cases were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), eight were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and two cases were biphenotypic. Nineteen cases were studied at diagnosis and six at time of relapse. p53 mutations were absent in all 19 cases studied at the time of diagnosis. The only mutation was a TGC-->TTC transversion (cys-->phe) at codon 141 in exon 5 in a case of infant ALL at relapse that occurred by subclone evolution after MLL gene translocation. We previously showed that p53 mutations are also absent in pediatric treatment-related leukemias with MLL gene translocations. The absence of p53 mutations at initial transformation may suggest that the anti-apoptotic effect of mutant p53 is not important in leukemias with MLL gene translocations. Alternatively, exogenous DNA damage may be the common feature in treatment-related and de novo cases. Since MLL gene translocations may occur through DNA repair and wild-type p53 is central to DNA repair, the absence of p53 mutations raises the possibility that wild-type p53, not mutant p53, may be important in the genesis of leukemias with these translocations",

    "Title": "p53 mutation with frequent novel condons but not a mutator phenotype in BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast tumours",
    "Abstract": "The status of p53 was investigated in breast tumours arising in germ- line carriers of mutant alleles of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and in a control series of sporadic breast tumours. p53 expression was detected in 20/26 (77%) BRCA1-, 10/22 (45%) BRCA2-associated and 25/72 (35%) grade- matched sporadic tumours. Analysis of p53 sequence revealed that the gene was mutant in 33/50 (66%) BRCA-associated tumours, whereas 7/20 (35%) sporadic grade-matched tumours contained p53 mutation (P<0.05). A number of the mutations detected in the BRCA-associated tumours have not been previously described in human cancer databases, whilst others occur extremely rarely. Analysis of additional genes, p16INK4, Ki-ras and beta-globin revealed absence or very low incidence of mutations, suggesting that the higher frequency of p53 mutation in the BRCA- associated tumours does not reflect a generalized increase in susceptibility to the acquisition of somatic mutation. Furthermore, absence of frameshift mutations in the polypurine tracts present in the coding sequence of the TGF beta type II receptor (TGF beta IIR) and Bax implies that loss of function of BRCA1 or BRCA2 does not confer a mutator phenotype such as that found in tumours with microsatellite instability (MSI). p21Waf1 was expressed in BRCA-associated tumours regardless of p53 status and, furthermore, some tumours expressing wild- type p53 did not express detectable p21Waf1. These data do not support, therefore, the simple model based on studies of BRCA-/- embryos, in which mutation of p53 in BRCA-associated tumours results in loss of p21Waf1 expression and deregulated proliferation. Rather, they imply that proliferation of such tumours will be subject to multiple mechanisms of growth regulation",

    "Title": "Chromosome number and structure both are markedly stable in RER colorectal cancers and are not destabilized by mutation of p53",
    "Abstract": "Fourteen colorectal cancer cell lines, categorized according to the presence or absence of microsatellite instability, were further analysed for chromosomal stability by karyotyping. NonRER (microsatellite stable) cell lines typically displayed highly aberrant karyotypes with alterations not only of chromosome number but also of chromosome structure including chromosomal deletions, inversions, and translocations. RER (microsatellite unstable) cell lines, in contrast, displayed significantly fewer alterations of chromosome number. Moreover, RER cell lines also displayed significantly fewer cytogenetically evident alterations of chromosome structure. Compared to NonRER colon cancers, RER colon cancers are significantly less likely to have undergone chromosomal gain, loss, or breakage. Characterization of p53 gene status by gene sequencing was performed in an attempt to determine if p53 gene status correlated with the chromosomal stability of the RER cancers. Gene mutations in p53 were present in all of the NonRER colon cancers. However, p53 gene mutations were also found present in four of nine of the RER colon cancers. Unexpectedly, RER colon cancers bearing mutant p53 demonstrated the same stability of chromosome number, and the same stability of chromosome structure, as the RER colon cancers with wild-type p53. Therefore, in RER colon cancers specific p53 independent mechanisms actively maintain the stability of both chromosome number and structure",

    "Title": "Reciprocal relationship between the tumor suppressors p53 and BAX in primary colorectal cancers",
    "Abstract": "Though most colorectal cancers show allelic losses, a subset of colorectal cancers (microsatellite instability or MSI-positive cancers) develop numerous small insertion and deletion mutations in repetitive DNA. Some of these sequences occur in coding regions of cancer related genes which, when targeted by frameshift mutations, produce truncations in their protein product. Such a gene is the proapoptotic tumor suppressor, BAX, mutated by frameshifts within a polyG sequence in approximately 50% of MSI-positive colorectal cancers. BAX is directly transactivated by p53, a gene commonly mutated in colorectal cancers but not often in MSI-positive lesions. Here we sought to characterize the relationship between BAX and p53 by simultaneously analysing a selected series of 65 colorectal tumors for mutations in the entire coding regions of both genes. The tumors comprised 19 MSI-high, 12 MSI- low and 34 MSI-null cancers. Eight of 19 MSI-high sporadic colorectal cancers (42%) contained insertions and deletions at the polyG tract in the BAX gene. In addition, three somatic BAX missense mutations were identified in two tumors. A single missense mutation was detected in an MSI-high tumor that also contained a frameshift microdeletion, and two missense mutations were identified in an MSI-null tumor wild-type for p53. p53 mutations were detected in 5/12 MSI-low tumors (42%) and 12/34 MSI-null tumors (35%). Of significance, no p53 mutations were detected in MSI-high tumors. This study demonstrates that a reciprocal relationship exists between p53 and BAX in sporadic colorectal cancers, and further supports the hypothesis that MSI-low tumors are biologically similar to MSI-null tumors",

    "Title": "Comparative survival analysis of p53 gene mutations and protein accumulation in colorectal cancer",
    "Abstract": "Immunohistochemical reactivity for p53 protein is common in various human malignancies. Increased intracellular concentration of p53, which is frequently, but not systematically, related to p53 mutation, has been proposed to be associated with poor prognosis in some tumor types. In colorectal cancer, this significance is still a matter of debate. To directly investigate the relationship between prognosis and p53 alterations, we screened a series of 72 colorectal carcinomas for overexpression and mutation of the p53 gene. Mutations in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene were assayed by single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct DNA sequencing, whereas p53 protein accumulation was detected in 10-microm frozen tissue by immunostaining using 2 different monoclonal antibodies (PAb 1801 and DO7). Thirty-six tumors (50%) showed p53 overexpression. Nineteen of the 36 tumors which contained high levels of p53 protein were found to have missense point mutations. Using a multivariate survival analysis, stage, differentiation, p53 immunoreactivity and p53 mutation emerged as risk factors, but only the stage was significant. In univariate analysis, stage, differentiation and p53 immunoreactivity were significant prognostic indicators, while p53 mutation was at the borderline of significance",

    "Title": "Genetic alterations in chronic pancreatitis: evidence for early occurrence of p53 but not K-ras mutations",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In patients suffering from chronic pancreatitis the risk for the development of pancreatic cancer ranges from 4 to 6 per cent. Various mutations are associated with pancreatic cancer, especially of p53 and K-ras. The incidence of these mutations in resected chronic pancreatitic tissue was investigated. METHODS: In the present study DNA from 80 samples of tissue from patients with chronic pancreatitis was isolated and subjected to single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of p53 exons 5-9 and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of K-ras (codon 12). RESULTS: No mutations in the K-ras gene were detected. On SSCP analysis, eight of 80 cases of chronic pancreatitis showed alterations (two in exon 5, four in exon 6, two in exon 7). DNA sequence analysis revealed one deletion of 21 amino acids (exon 5), four polymorphisms in exon 6 with no change in the amino acid sequence, one point mutation in exon 5, and two point mutations located in the intron between exons 6 and 7. CONCLUSION: These data show that in some cases of chronic pancreatitis mutations in the p53 gene occur without morphological evidence of pancreatic cancer",

    "Abstract": "The high prevalence of p53 mutations in human cancers and the suggestion from several groups that the presence or absence of p53 mutations might have both prognostic and therapeutic consequences point to the importance of optimal methods for p53 determination. Several strategies exploring this have been described, based either on mRNA or genomic DNA as a template. However, no comparative study on the reliability of the two templates has been performed. The principal aim of this study was to study the concordance of RNA- and DNA-based direct sequencing methods in detecting p53 mutations in breast tumors. In 100 tumors, 22 mutations were detected by both methods. Furthermore, one stop mutation, two splice-site mutations, and one intron alteration were found only by genomic sequencing. In addition, the comparative study suggests that cells with missense mutations have increased steady- state concentrations of p53-specific mRNA, in contrast to cells with a gene encoding a truncated protein",

    "Title": "Exon 5 of the p53 gene is a target for deletions in ovarian cancer",
    "Abstract": "Missense point mutations, leading to inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene product, are currently the most frequent alterations in human cancer. Little, however, is known about small intragenic deletions or insertions occurring in this locus of chromosome 17. We have analyzed 56 primary ovarian tumors for the presence of such abnormalities. The analysis was based on multiplex PCR amplification of exons 1 through 11 of the p53 gene and fragment analysis of the generated PCR products. Mutations were detected in 14% (8 of 56) of the tumors. Deletions were much more prevalent than insertions (seven vs one). Six of the deletions and the insertion affected exon 5, and the other deletion was in exon 7. Two deletions and the insertion did not disrupt the reading frame; the protein product was expressed in the tumor at high concentrations in all three cases. The other five deletions generated a frameshift, which is predicted to result in the production of a truncated protein product. In the case of the deletions, a 2-5-bp repeat was present close to the detected deletion, whereas the insertion duplicated the sequence immediately upstream of the insertion site. Overall our findings indicate that small intragenic p53 deletions/insertions are not rare events in ovarian cancer, and that p53 exon 5 is the target in the vast majority (88%) of the cases",

    "Title": "Rapid sequencing of the p53 gene with a new automated DNA sequencer",
    "Abstract": "p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers. Approximately 90% of the p53 gene mutations are localized between domains encoding exons 5 to 8. Sequencing methods currently available are tedious and time-consuming and are not suitable for routine laboratory testing. In an effort to identify a simple and rapid sequencing method, we analyzed 16 preselected breast tumors and 18 preselected ovarian tumors, using a newly developed automated DNA sequencer. p53 gene mutations had been previously identified in these tumors, using a conventional automated sequencing procedure. Exons 5 to 8 were amplified by PCR, and the PCR products were subsequently subjected to cycle sequencing with the Sanger chain termination method, using Cy5.5-labeled primers. The sequencing mixture was then resolved on a newly developed automated DNA sequencer that can sequence approximately 300 bases of DNA in 30 min. Of these 16 breast tumors, two had mutations in exon 5, four in exon 6, three in exon 7, and three in exon 8. Of the 18 ovarian tumors, two had mutations in exon 5, five in exon 6, two in exon 7, and three in exon 8. In all cases, we identified the same mutations by both the new and the conventional sequencing procedures. Most mutations affected an arginine codon. These data demonstrate that the new method has the capability to provide accurate sequencing information in a fraction of the time and labor in comparison with current automated sequencing techniques. When such procedures are used, DNA sequencing may become a routine tool for identifying clinically important mutations for diagnosis and prognosis of patients with genetic, malignant, infectious, and other diseases",

    "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is characterized by a high risk of sarcomas, early onset of breast cancer, and a diversity of other cancers occurring as multiple primary tumors in multiple family members. In many families with LFS, germline mutations within the tumor-suppressor gene p53 have been identified. However, mutations in p53 have not been detected in approximately 30% of LFS families. To address the possibility either that p53 mutations were being missed or that another predisposing gene is altered in LFS, we used a variety of methods to accurately determine the p53 status in a large LFS kindred. A transcriptional activation assay on exons 4-10 of p53 excluded a mutation within the DNA-binding domain of p53. Single-stranded conformational-polymorphism analysis, using intronic primers and sequencing of all the coding exons and intron/exon junctions, also yielded no mutations. Finally, linkage analysis excluded potential mutations in the noncoding regions of p53. Our findings exclude the presence of a p53 germline mutation in a classic LFS family",

In opposite to the conventional analytical application the heteroduplex technique is performed to preparatively separate mutated from non- mutated PCR amplified DNA fragments. We used the new method to detect mutations in the tumor suppressor gene APC in stool DNA from patients with sporadic colorectal carcinomas. Since the alteration of the APC gene occurs early in most colorectal tumors, the detection of APC mutations in fecal tumor DNA by HD-PCR may be a powerful tool in non- invasive cancer diagnostics",

Eleven of 13 (85%) were single base pair substitutions (9 transitions and 2 transversions), and 2 were deletions. Two novel mutations were identified: a large 63-base pair deletion, and a single base pair substitution.

Normal tongue epithelium adjacent to lesions was used as a control. The four lesions harbored the common mutation of APC gene that was not detected in the control. At codon 1621 in exon 15 of the APC gene there was a C to G substitution resulting in serine (TCA) to stop codon (TGA). No mutation of p53 gene was detected in any samples of the control and three precancerous lesions of the tongue. On the other hand, an A to G substitution at codon 170 in exon 5 of p53 gene resulting in glutamic acid (ACG) to glycine (GCG) was detected in the DNA of her tongue cancer. These results may suggest that the four lesions have the same origin, and that multi-step oncogenesis had occurred, the APC gene alteration being one of the early events in the process of tumorigenesis and p53 gene alteration involved in the late events",

    "Title": "Infrequent p53 mutations in arsenic-related skin lesions",
    "Abstract": "Oral arsenic exposure increases the risk for a variety of benign and malignant skin lesions, but the molecular mechanism of the carcinogenic effect is poorly understood. Arsenic-related squamous cell carcinomas of the skin can develop either de novo or progress from Bowen's disease lesions. Arsenic-related basal cell carcinomas develop usually in non- sun-exposed areas and are multiple. Because p53 tumor suppressor protein is a protective cellular molecule against environmental carcinogens and mutations in the p53 gene are frequent in nonmelanoma skin cancers, we studied p53 in 23 premalignant or malignant skin lesions from seven patients with a history of arsenic medication. The eighth patient studied (with six lesions) had a long standing exposure to UV radiation. Accumulation of the p53 protein was detected (with a monoclonal DO-7 antibody) in 78% of the lesions from cases with arsenic exposure. Two of the six (30%) arsenic-related premalignant lesions and in addition one UV related carcinoma in situ lesion were clearly and repeatedly positive when p53 exons 5 to 8 were screened by a nonradioactive single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Only one of the arsenic-related lesions was confirmed by sequencing to have a mutation (a CC to TT double transition). No indications of mutations were found among the 18 basal cell carcinoma or two squamous cell carcinoma lesions studied. Our results suggest that the frequent accumulation of p53 protein in arsenic-related skin lesions is not due to p53 mutations. which may not be a prerequisite in the development of arsenic-induced skin cancers",

    "Title": "Bax is an important determinant of chemosensitivity in pediatric tumor cell lines independent of Bcl-2 expression and p53 status",
    "Abstract": "Susceptibility of a tumor cell to undergo chemotherapy-induced apoptosis appears to be dependent upon the balance of proapoptotic and survival factors that are expressed within any given cell. We have chosen to evaluate how expression of several of these proteins influences chemosensitivity of a panel of 10 pediatric tumor cell lines chosen from three tumor histiotypes: neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and pediatric glial tumors. The proteins evaluated were p53 and six members of the Bax/Bcl-2 family: three proapoptotic proteins (Bax, Bak, and Bcl-xS) and three survival factors (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1). We investigated whether there was any relationship between endogenous expression of these proteins and chemosensitivity (or resistance) to three chemotherapeutic agents that directly damage DNA (doxorubicin, actinomycin D, and topotecan) and a mitotic spindle poison (vincristine). Even though exogenous overexpression of wild-type p53 has been associated with a chemosensitive phenotype in several model systems we demonstrated no such relationship in these studies. In addition, expression levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-xS, Bak, or Mcl-1 did not correlate with sensitivity or resistance to the four drugs. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between endogenous levels of Bax protein and sensitivity to both doxorubicin and actinomycin D. We conclude that even though many proteins such as p53 and Bcl-2 have been shown to influence drug response when exogenously overexpressed in model systems, in unmodified cell lines endogenous protein levels may not generate the same results. We have demonstrated that endogenous Bax expression was the only protein found to be associated with chemosensitivity across the three different tumor histiotypes and propose that analysis of Bax may be a more useful prognostic indicator for tumor response to therapy than either p53 or Bcl-2",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in mammary ductal carcinoma in situ but not in epithelial hyperplasias",
    "Abstract": "The development and progression of human breast neoplasia is characterized by the accumulation of numerous somatic genetic alterations. Although mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is one of the most common alterations identified in invasive carcinomas, it is not clear whether mutations usually occur in noninvasive lesions before the development of invasion. To investigate the presence and heterogeneity of p53 mutations in breast neoplasia, we studied a morphological spectrum of paired lesions including invasive carcinomas and adjacent noninvasive epithelial lesions. Using 18 invasive ductal carcinomas with known p53 mutations, tissue samples were microdissected from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections, and mutations in exons 4-8 of the p53 gene were identified by PCR amplification, single-strand conformational polymorphism, and direct sequencing. Multiple geographically distinct foci of invasive carcinoma were microdissected from six different invasive carcinomas, and all samples from each case had the same mutation. The absence of mutation heterogeneity provides evidence that p53 mutations occurred at the time of, or before, the clonal selection of the dominant component of the invasive carcinoma. To delineate the timing of p53 inactivation further in these cases, histological slides were reviewed to identify all noninvasive epithelial lesions. There were eight cases with associated ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and in total, 27 distinct tissue samples representing a spectrum of histological subtypes and grades of DCIS were microdissected. In all 27 samples, the identical p53 mutation was identified in the DCIS as was present in the invasive carcinoma. In contrast, no p53 mutations were identified in any of the 21 microdissected foci of epithelial hyperplasia analyzed, including one sample with atypia. Together, these findings provide support that p53 mutations commonly occur early in breast neoplasia, usually at the stage of DCIS, but are not often identified in foci of hyperplasia. These findings support an important biological role for p53 mutation in progression from noninvasive precursors in breast neoplasia and provide further evidence that p53 mutation could have potential use as a molecular marker",

Patients with pyothorax-associated lymphoma (PAL) have long been exposed to antituberculous drugs, antibiotics, bacterial or viral products, and frequent diagnostic radiation for the confirmation of pneumothorax and pyothorax. We analyzed p53 mutations on paraffin-embedded specimens from 21 patients with PAL by PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism followed by direct sequencing. An unusually high frequency of p53 mutations (14 of 21 cases, 67%) was detected in the PAL specimens, and mutations consisted of 13 nucleotide substitutions and 1 deletion. Furthermore, 10 of 13 substitutions (77%) occurred at dipyrimidine sites (CC:GG to CT:GA substitution). Such specificity has not been reported, except for solar light-related skin cancer and AIDS- related lymphoma in some parts. An UV light mimetic agent may be produced in the long history of chronic inflammation in tuberculosis or immunodeficient patients",

    "Title": "Independent pathways of p53 induction by cisplatin and X-rays in a cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumor cell line",
    "Abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor gene is critical in regulating cell proliferation following DNA damage, and disruption of p53 protein function by mutation has been implicated as a factor responsible for resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Our studies were initiated by asking whether the translational product of the p53 gene is associated with cisplatin resistance in the 2780CP human ovarian tumor model. We have demonstrated by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing that p53 in parental cisplatin- sensitive A2780 cells was wild type. In 2780CP cells, however, a mutation was found in exon 5 at codon 172 (Val to Phe). Interestingly, exposure to X-rays resulted in p53 induction in both A2780 and 2780CP tumor models. The p53 increases by the ionizing radiation were accompanied by concomitant increases in levels of the p53-regulated p21Waf1/Cip1 protein and led to arrest of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle. A yeast functional assay confirmed that p53 in A2780 was wild type, but, more importantly, it provided evidence that the p53 mutation in 2780CP cells was temperature sensitive and heterozygous. These experiments demonstrate that sensitive and resistant cells have normal p53 functions, despite the presence of p53 mutation in the 2780CP model. In parallel investigations using the Western technique, exposure of A2780 cells to clinically relevant concentrations of cisplatin (1-20 microM) resulted in time- and dose-dependent increases in p53, together with coordinate increases in p21Waf1/Cip1. In contrast, cisplatin did not induce these proteins in 2780CP cells to any significant degree. The results indicate that a defect exists in the signal transduction pathway for p53 induction following cisplatin-induced DNA damage in 2780CP cells, and this may represent a significant mechanism of cisplatin resistance. Furthermore, induction of p53 in 2780CP cells by X-rays, but not cisplatin, strongly suggests that independent pathways are involved in p53 regulation for the two DNA-damaging agents",

    "Title": "Selective sensitivity to radiation of cerebral glioblastomas harboring p53 mutations",
    "Abstract": "Recent studies suggest that a balance may exist between the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-inducing functions of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Adenoviral p21 transduction attenuates apoptosis, whereas deletion of the p21 gene promotes it, and p21-null xenografts respond better than isogenic p21-wild type tumors to irradiation. Hence, the role of p53 in dictating the clinical response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be more complex than previously thought. We have analyzed survival and radiation response (regrowth-free period) of 42 patients with glioblastomas whose p53 status was determined by a sensitive yeast functional assay. Multivariate analysis revealed that p53 mutation is associated with longer survival (P < 0.02). Among 36 radiation-treated patients, the regrowth-free period after treatment was significantly longer for tumors with p53 mutations (P < 0.0001), and p53 mutation was the sole independent factor predictive of radiotherapeutic response (P < 0.01). Survival time after regrowth was independent of p53 status, suggesting that the difference in survival was related to the treatment rather than to the intrinsic aggressiveness of the tumor. Thus, in this Northern Japanese population, p53 mutation is a marker for better radiation response in glioblastomas, and this results in significantly longer survival",

    "Title": "Clones of normal keratinocytes and a variety of simultaneously present epidermal neoplastic lesions contain a multitude of p53 gene mutations in a xeroderma pigmentosum patient",
    "Abstract": "A patient with xeroderma pigmentosum group C was extensively examined for mutations in the p53 gene in normal skin exposed to varying degrees of sunlight and in excisional biopsies of basal cell cancer, squamous cell cancer, and squamous cell dysplasia. Seventy-three samples were analyzed by microdissection of small cell clusters, followed by PCR and direct DNA sequencing. In skin taken from areas that most likely had never been exposed to the sun, no mutations were found. However, in skin exposed to the sun, we observed a multitude of mutations in the p53 gene. UV light-induced mutations were found in all types of lesions, as well as in clusters of morphologically normal epidermal cells. Twenty-nine distinct mutations were found in exons 5-8, all missense or nonsense, of which 27 (93%) were UV-specific C --> T or CC - -> TT transitions at dipyrimidine sites of the nontranscribed strand. Two types of normal skin areas containing p53 mutations were observed: areas that stain strongly with p53 antibody (p53 patches) and those that do not stain. Because no silent or intron mutations were found in these cell clusters, the alterations in the p53 gene of morphologically normal cells are likely to have resulted in a selective growth advantage. The poor correlation between mutations and morphological phenotypes demonstrates that p53 mutations alone do not determine the phenotypes observed",

    "Abstract": "The most important subgroup of breast cancer patients for which reliable prognostic factors are needed are women without axillary lymph node involvement. Although overall, these patients have a good prognosis, it is known that 20-30% will experience a recurrence of the disease. To determine the prognostic significance of P53 tumor suppressor gene mutation, specimens from 113 primary breast cancers were evaluated for the presence of P53 alterations, as detected by cDNA sequencing of the entire coding sequence of the gene. The median follow- up for patients was 105 months. P53 gene mutation was an independent prognostic marker of early relapse and death. Our results suggest that P53 gene mutations could be an important factor to identify node- negative patients who have a poor prognosis in the absence of adjuvant therapy. Prospective studies should be designed to determine which therapy should be performed in this subgroup of patients",

    "Title": "High frequency of deletion mutations in p53 gene from squamous cell lung cancer patients in Taiwan",
    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading and second-leading cause of cancer deaths among women and men in Taiwan, respectively. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in lung tumorigenesis in Taiwan remain poorly defined. A study that analyzed the mutation spectrum of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in 35 female lung cancer patients in Hong Kong showed that a high proportion of the mutations observed were deletions, suggesting the possible involvement of a distinct mutagenic factor(s) in Chinese female lung cancer patients (Y. Takagi et al., Cancer Res., 55: 5354-5357, 1995). Therefore, to gain insight into the role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and possible etiological factors in lung tumorigenesis in Taiwan, we investigated the mutation spectra of exons 4-11 in the p53 tumor suppressor gene of 60 lung cancer patients in Taiwan. These data were also correlated with clinical pathological characteristics of patients. Lung tumors were surgically resected, genomic DNA was isolated, and their mutation spectra were examined using PCR/single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. The frequency of p53 gene mutation was 18% (11 of 60). However, distinct patterns of p53 gene mutation were observed. Seven of 11 mutations detected (64%) were deletions of 1-12 bp at G:C bp or at bp in the immediate vicinity of repetitive sequences and/or tandem repeat sequences. In addition, two patients (2 of 11, 18%) exhibited nonsense mutations. In contrast to the frequent occurrence of missense mutations in the p53 gene reported in the literature, the majority (82%) of the mutations in lung cancer patients in Taiwan were nonmissense mutations, ie., deletions and nonsense mutations. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that p53 mutations including non- in-frame deletions and nonsense mutations all resulted in no expression of p53 protein. Notably, mutations occurred more frequently in patients suffering from squamous cell carcinoma (SQ). Nine of 31 SQ patients (29%) exhibited deletions or nonsense mutations, suggesting that deletions and nonsense mutations in the p53 gene are involved in the formation of SQ in Taiwan. In addition, mutations occurred more frequently in patients with stage III or IV lung cancer. However, mutations were not correlated with patients' smoking habits. Our data suggest that p53 gene mutation involved in the formation of SQ and distinct environmental factor(s) and/or genetic factor(s) that induced specific short deletions in repeat sequences may be involved in lung tumorigenesis in Taiwan",

    "Abstract": "We have searched for the presence of genetic alterations in serum DNA obtained from 44 colorectal cancer patients. Microsatellite analysis using highly polymorphic markers revealed loss of heterozygosity and/or microsatellite instability in 35 of 44 (80%) primary tumors. No alterations were detected in the paired serum DNA. We next used an oligonucleotide-mediated mismatch ligation assay to detect tumor specific gene mutations in the serum. Among the 16 cases with a K-ras gene mutation in the tumor, the same mutation was detected in three paired serum samples. In the 10 cases with a p53 mutation in the tumor, the identical mutation was detected in seven corresponding serum samples. Comparison of the molecular analysis with clinical diagnosis of these patients revealed that none of the seven Dukes' stage B patients with a K-ras mutation in their tumors demonstrated a mutation in the serum. In contrast, five of seven stage B patients with a p53 mutation in the tumor demonstrated a mutation in the paired serum (P = 0.01, Fisher's exact test). Taken together, either a K-ras or p53 mutation was detected in the serum in 40% of the 25 patients (95% confidence interval, 21-61%), whose primary tumors contained a mutation and in 23% of the 44 patients (95% confidence interval, 12-38%) with colorectal cancer. The frequent detection of p53 mutation in the serum of patients with early stage tumors suggests a possible use of this approach for clinical prognosis and cancer monitoring of colorectal cancer patients",

    "Abstract": "A tumor cell line, HCC1937, was established from a primary breast carcinoma from a 24-year-old patient with a germ-line BRCA1 mutation. A corresponding B-lymphoblastoid cell line was established from the patient's peripheral blood lymphocytes. BRCA1 analysis revealed that the tumor cell line is homozygous for the BRCA1 5382insC mutation, whereas the patient's lymphocyte DNA is heterozygous for the same mutation, as are at least two other family members' lymphocyte DNA. The tumor cell line is marked by multiple additional genetic changes including a high degree of aneuploidy, an acquired mutation of TP53 with wild-type allele loss, an acquired homozygous deletion of the PTEN gene, and loss of heterozygosity at multiple loci known to be involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Comparison of the primary tumor with the cell line revealed the same BRCA1 mutation and an identical pattern of allele loss at multiple loci, indicating that the cell line had maintained many of the properties of the original tumor. This breast tumor-derived cell line may provide a useful model system for the study of familial breast cancer pathogenesis and for elucidating BRCA1 function and localization",

    "Abstract": "Hereditary ovarian cancers associated with germline mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 were studied to determine whether somatic mutation of the P53 gene is required for BRCA-linked ovarian tumorigenesis and further, whether the spectrum of additional somatic molecular genetic alterations present in these tumors differs from that known to exist in sporadic ovarian cancers. Forty tumors, 29 linked to BRCA1 and 11 linked to BRCA2, were examined for mutational alterations in P53, K- RAS, ERBB-2, C-MYC, and AKT2. The presence of a P53 mutation in 80% of these cancers indicates that P53 mutation is common but not required for BRCA-linked ovarian tumorigenesis; notably, a significantly higher proportion of the P53 mutations in BRCA2-linked cancers were deletions or insertions compared with the more typical spectrum of missense mutations seen in BRCA1-linked cancers. Additionally, BRCA-linked ovarian carcinomas seem to develop through a unique pathway of tumorigenesis that does not involve mutation of K-RAS or amplification of ERBB-2, C-MYC, or AKT2",

    "Abstract": "Fifty-eight skin biopsies and three primary internal tumors from patients affected by the rare hereditary disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) were studied by an improved PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis to detect the mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53. The results from cutaneous XP tumors, including 27 squamous cell carcinomas and 6 basal cell carcinomas, show a very high level (86%) of p53 mutations. The analysis of mutations found in XP skin cancers according to the complementation group of the patients shows that tandem CC-->TT transitions are a characteristic of XP-C patients with a frequency much higher in their skin tumors (85%) compared with tumors in XP patients who do not belong to group C (33%). In all XP-C biopsies, mutations were due to replication of unrepaired DNA lesions on the nontranscribed strand of the p53 gene, substantiating the preferential repair in vivo of the transcribed strand of this gene in human tissues. For the first time, we were able to analyze three primary internal tumors (a neuroendocrine tumor of the thyroid, a gastric adenocarcinoma, and a glioma of the brain) of young XP children. All of them contained one mutation on the p53 gene, which were different from the ones found in the XP skin tumors and could have resulted from unrepaired lesions caused by oxidative damage",

    "Abstract": "Transformation and immortalization require the inactivation of key cell cycle regulatory genes. We examined 19 bladder cancer cell lines derived from 17 patients for alterations in TP53, RB1, CDKN2A, and ARF. Twelve cell lines had a mutation in exons 5-11 of TP53 and, with only one exception, a concomitant loss of RB1 protein expression. Another group of seven cell lines had a wild-type TP53 gene or a mutation in exons 1-4 of TP53 and concomitant alterations in both CDKN2A and ARF in every case. This demonstrates the requirement, in all but one line, for inactivation of both the CDKN2A/RB1 and ARF/TP53 pathways in bladder cancer cell lines and provides the first evidence for potential differences in the penetrance of mutations in the transactivation and DNA-binding domains of TP53",

    "Abstract": "The biological behavior of soft tissue leiomyosarcoma varies with its location: tumors in deep soft tissue show a worse prognosis than those in superficial soft tissue. In this study, we analyzed cell proliferating factors (mitotic and Ki-67 indices) and the p53 status of both types of leiomyosarcoma (37 cases) to evaluate the possibility that these factors may serve as indicators in prognosis. Expression of both of the cell proliferating factors were higher in the superficial type, but these differences were not significant. The incidence of abnormal p53 detected by immunohistochemistry and mutation analysis was also higher in the superficial type, but, again, no significant difference was observed. Abnormal p53 and a high Ki-67 index in the deep type, and a large tumor size (>6 cm) in the superficial type may be useful as prognostic factors. Interestingly, all of the superficial cases who died of the disease showed abnormal p53. In conclusion, these two types of leiomyosarcoma are essentially the same, and their location remains a good prognostic factor. Furthermore, abnormality of the p53 gene was related to a poor prognosis regardless of the tumor's anatomic location",

    "Abstract": "Gastric cancer shows remarkable heterogeneity in histological pattern, cellular phenotype, and genotype. Tumor subsets identified by varying procedures have shown limited reciprocal correlation and have failed to provide a sound rationale for the characterization and classification of all tumors. Based on a case series of 130 gastric cancers that covered both early (70 cases) and advanced (60 cases) stages and that represented most histological types and structural patterns, this study investigated (1) microsatellite instability and p53 gene mutation by means of PCR-based molecular techniques and (2) p53 protein accumulation or tumor cell immunophenotype by means of immunoperoxidase procedures. It was found that microsatellite instability and p53 gene mutation involve two distinct subsets of both early and advanced-stage glandular (intestinal) cancer, and that, contrastingly, they leave purely diffuse cancers unaffected. Mixed cancers, namely, those in which glandular admixed with diffuse growths, showed scarce microsatellite instability at all stages, whereas prominent p53 gene mutation and p53 protein accumulation was limited to the advanced stage alone. No significant correlation was found between tumor cell immunophenotype and either genotype or histotype, although some correlation with particular structural patterns was detected. Comparison of intramucosal with invasive growths within any given tumor suggested that invasive cancers with diffuse-type growth arise in part from mucosal cancers of glandular or mixed structure through progressive loss of intercellular junctional systems. It is concluded that at least two genetically distinct subsets of glandular cancer, one with microsatellite instability and the other with p53 lesions, should be separated both from purely diffuse cancer and, at least in the advanced stage, from mixed cancer. Available evidence suggests distinct clinicopathologic profiles for such tumor entities",

    "Abstract": "Alterations in tumor suppressor gene p53, localized on chromosome 17p13, are considered to play a significant role in the initiation and, to some extent, even in the progression of various malignant tumors. In this respect, investigations on conventional highly malignant osteosarcomas have shown a mutation rate of approximately 20%. However, currently, data on the mutation rate in the group of variant histology osteosarcomas of low-grade malignancy do not exist. Therefore, we investigated a panel of low malignant entities (five low malignant intramedullary osteosarcomas grade 1; one intramedullary osteosarcoma grade 2; eight parosteal osteosarcomas, including one local recurrence grades 1 and 2, and five periosteal osteosarcomas grade 2) with polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR- SSCP) analysis focusing on exons 4 to 8 of the p53 gene followed by direct sequencing. Point mutations were found in one low-grade osteoblastoma-like osteosarcoma and in two periosteal osteosarcomas grade 2 (one missense, one silent, and one nonsense mutation). This mutation rate of 15.7% (3 of 19) is comparable to that determined in highly malignant osteosarcomas. Moreover, the analysis of clinical data did not show any difference in the behavior of tumors with p53 mutations compared with those without. Therefore, we suggest that alterations in p53 gene are an early event in the tumorigenesis of malignant osteoblastic tumors without impact on progression of these tumors",

    "Abstract": "Female genital tract carcinosarcomas (FGTCS) are biphasic neoplasms composed of an admixture of malignant epithelial and mesenchymal elements. Histogenesis of FGTCS centers on two theories: (1) simultaneous formation of independent tumors (biclonal theory), (2) multidirectional differentiation of a single neoplasm (monoclonal theory). In an attempt to resolve this histogenetic controversy, we determined the presence, specific genotype, and timing of p53 mutational change in each component of FGTCS using a topographic genotyping (TG) approach. We selected 43 FGTCS from the files of Magee- Womens Hospital, Pittsburgh, and initially immunostained them for p53 protein. Strong p53 immunopositivity was detected in 35 (82%) of 43 tumors. Subsequently, topographic genotyping (TG) was performed on a subset of nine immunopositive tumors with sufficiently distinct malignant components to enable effective sampling. All nine tumors showed point mutations in p53 exons 5 through 8. In each case, the identical point mutational genotype was present in both components. Furthermore, in all nine cases mutations were present with loss of the wild-type allele. P53 gene mutation is a frequent event in progression of FGTCS. Of importance, both p53 mutation and allelic loss occur before the differentiation into separate epithelial and mesenchymal malignant components. These molecular findings strongly support monoclonal, multidirectional histogenesis of FGTCS",

    "Abstract": "The genetic events responsible for tumor progression may be defined by careful analysis of genetic changes in well-chosen tumors which contain distinct cell populations representing each stage of progression. Here we report a case of a trichilemmal carcinoma arising in the wall of a proliferating trichilemmal cyst (PTC). DNA was isolated from microdissected areas of the PTC and the carcinoma respectively, and PCR- based microsatellite loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis as well as p53 gene sequencing performed. A CGA to TGA nonsense mutation at codon 306 in exon 8 of the p53 gene was found in both samples. LOH analysis showed that the PTC retained chromosome arm 17p (where the p53 gene resides), whereas the carcinoma was associated with the loss of this allele. All the other loci examined were retained including 3p, 9q, 13q and 17q in both tumor parts. The results confirm a common clonal origin of the PTC and the trichilemmal carcinoma, and strongly suggest that the complete loss of the wild-type p53 is a critical event responsible for malignant transformation in this particular case",

    "Title": "Loss of p53 function in uterine papillary serous carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "In contrast to endometrioid carcinoma, uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) is an aggressive type of endometrial cancer. Loss of p53 function is critical for the molecular pathogenesis of UPSC. Both UPSC and its putative precursor, endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (EIC), show abnormal p53 overexpression in most tumors. To further assess the nature of p53 alterations in UPSC, we systematically reevaluated a subset of our previous cohort of UPSC patients. In the current study, we correlate mutations of the p53 gene as detected by direct sequencing of exons 5 through 8 with p53 accumulation and expression of Waf-1 in 32 UPSC tumors. Waf-1 is a downstream effector of p53-mediated G1 arrest after DNA damage and, thus, an indicator of p53 functionality. Although 78% of tumors exhibited strong nuclear p53 immunoreactivity in 100% of tumor cells, we were able to detect p53 mutations in 53%. As expected, all p53 mutant tumors (17 cases) exhibited p53 overexpression. Seventy percent of those (12 tumors) showed concomitant lack of Waf-1 expression consistent with transcriptionally inactive p53, whereas the other five tumors showed Waf-1 staining in only a minor fraction of tumor cells consistent with p53-independent Waf-1 expression. In contrast, 47% (15 cases) of tumors failed to exhibit p53 mutations; interestingly, more than half of those (eight cases) showed strong nuclear p53 accumulation in all tumor cells but lacked concomitant Waf-1 expression. These findings are consistent with a mutation-dependent and -independent type of p53 inactivation in UPSC that are both associated with nuclear overexpression. Our findings suggest that the combined immunocytochemical analysis of p53 and Waf-1 is a valuable means of assessing the functional status of p53. In summary, p53 alterations are common in UPSC and probably responsible for its aggressive biological behavior",

    "Title": "p53 mutagenesis in Klatskin tumors",
    "Abstract": "Mutagenesis of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene represents the most common genetic alteration in human malignancies but has not yet been investigated in Klatskin tumors. Cancerous and normal liver tissues were obtained from 12 patients after surgical resection of Klatsin tumors. Genomic DNA was extracted and served as a template for PCR amplification and sequencing of a 1,574-bp fragment of the p53 gene comprising the exons 5 through 8. Immunohistochemical expression analysis was performed using five different antibodies. Missense mutations were detected in 2 of 12 patients--one transversion on codon 273 (Arg --> Leu) and a transition on codon 168 (His --> Arg). In all specimens, immunohistochemistry was negative regarding a nuclear overexpression. An apparent clinicopathologic impact of p53 mutations was not observed. This report on mutagenesis of the p53 gene in Klatskin tumors shows that the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancers is also mutated in a subset of patients with Klatskin tumors. Assessment of a clinical or pathological impact of p53 mutagenesis on Klatskin tumors requires evaluation in larger studies",

    "Title": "p53 alterations in atypical alveolar hyperplasia of the human lung",
    "Abstract": "Atypical alveolar hyperplasia (AAH) is a potential precursor lesion from which lung adenocarcinomas arise and may be a good target for studying the early events of lung tumorigenesis. We have previously shown that AAHs are neoplastic epithelial proliferations that often harbor activating mutations of the K-ras oncogene. In the current study, we examined a spectrum of AAHs to determine the frequency and timing of p53 alterations in lung tumorigenesis. We analyzed 37 AAHs and their paired overt lung neoplasms for p53 protein accumulation using the monoclonal antibody DO7. DNA sequence analysis of the p53 gene was performed on those cases demonstrating p53 protein accumulation. AAHs were classified as low-grade, high-grade, or AAH- like carcinoma based on cytoarchitectural features. Accumulation of the p53 protein was found in none (0%) of 20 low-grade AAHs, in 1 (9%) of 11 high-grade AAHs, and in three (50%) of six AAH-like carcinomas. There was a statistically significant trend toward p53 accumulation with increasing grade of the AAHs. A missense mutation in exon 7 of the p53 gene was found in 1 AAH-like carcinoma, whereas mutations in exons 5 through 8 could not be detected in the other three AAHs with p53 protein accumulation. Three of the paired overt carcinomas harbored p53 mutations that were not present in the AAHs. Alterations of p53 do not appear to be common events in AAHs, especially when these lesions exhibit low-grade cytoarchitectural features. Alterations of p53, however, are more frequent at the level of AAH-like carcinoma and may be associated with the transition from a benign to a malignant proliferation of pneumocytes",

    "Title": "Mutation of the p53 gene in postradiation sarcoma",
    "Abstract": "Radiotherapy is known to cause secondary malignancies in the radiation field; postradiation sarcomas (PRS) are one example of such malignancies. Little is known about the genetic changes, including p53 gene alterations, that are thought to play a role in the tumorigenesis of human PRS. In the present study, p53 gene mutations were analyzed on paraffin-embedded specimens from 24 patients with PRS (4 men and 20 women) by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) followed by direct sequencing. The primary tumors of these patients were uterine cervical cancers in 14, breast cancers in 3, malignant lymphomas in 2, and others in 5. Total radiation doses ranged from 36 to 300 Gy (median, 60 Gy). The latent period between completion of radiation therapy and development of PRS ranged from 3 to 34 years (median, 10 years). Malignant fibrous histiocytoma was the most common PRS, accounting for 12 cases. PCR-SSCP revealed the aberrant mobility shifts of bands in 24 cases: 21 shifts in exon 5, 18 in exon 7, and 12 in exon 8. Direct sequencing of the SSCP product revealed a total of 58 mutations in 21 (88%) of 24 cases: 4 cases had a single mutation, 5 had 2 mutations, 5 had 3 mutations, 6 had 4 mutations, and 1 had 5 mutations. Although 31% of the mutations did not change an amino acid, every tumor had at least one mutation that did, which may have provided the selection pressure for expansion. The frequency of p53 gene mutation in sporadic soft tissue sarcomas was 20%. These findings highlighted the extraordinarily high frequency of p53 gene mutations in PRS. G:C to A:T transition at dipyrimidine sites was found in 14 (58%) of 24 cases. Collectively, these findings indicate that radiation is causative for soft tissue sarcomas via p53 gene mutations",

    "Abstract": "Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is characterized by intraluminal proliferation of epithelial cells and can be divided into high-grade (HGPIN) and low-grade (LGPIN) lesions. HGPIN is regarded as the most likely precursor of prostatic carcinoma (PCA). Microdissected DNA selectively extracted from paraffin-embedded sections of 29 cases of PCA and 1 benign prostatic hypertrophy were analyzed for p53 mutation by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA fragments followed by direct sequencing. These patients had received total prostatectomy (27 cases) or transurethral resection (3 cases). Under direct microscopic observation, DNA was microdissected from 108 lesions: 67 lesions from 22 cases of PIN (55 HGPIN and 12 LGPIN), 29 from 22 cases of PCA, and 12 from 11 cases of adjoining benign glands. Analysis revealed 13 mutations in 10 lesions from six cases. All 13 were point mutations: 7 missense, 5 silent, and 1 nonsense. Mutations were detected in 3 cases (14%) of PIN and 5 cases (25%) of PCA. PIN lesions with p53 mutations were all categorized as HGPIN. Neither LGPIN nor benign glands adjoining PIN and/or PCA had mutations. Two PIN and one PCA lesion in each of two cases had mutations that were different from each other. G- to-A transition was the commonest mutation pattern. The current findings showed that HGPIN, but not LGPIN, and PCA are similar with regard to p53 mutation. The diverse patterns of p53 mutation among HGPIN and PCA lesions suggested multiclonal development of prostatic precancerous lesions",

    "Title": "p53 alterations in oesophageal cancer: association with clinicopathological features, risk factors, and survival",
    "Abstract": "AIM: To characterise the spectrum of p53 alterations (gene mutations and protein accumulation) in a consecutive series of surgically resected oesophageal cancers, and to evaluate associations with clinicopathological findings (age, sex, tumour histology, grade, and stage), potential risk factors (alcohol, tobacco, hot beverage consumption, history of gastrooesophageal reflux disease and antacid use), and survival. METHODS: The case series comprised 61 sequentially accrued patients with primary oesophageal carcinomas. Genomic DNA was extracted from banked (frozen) tumours and matched normal mucosal tissue; p53 mutations (exons 4-10) were studied by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. Immunohistochemistry (DO7, CM1) was used to assess cell nuclear p53 protein accumulation. Risk factor data, overall and disease free survival were measured prospectively, and analysis was carried out at the univariate level using Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log rank tests, and in multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazards models (parsimonious and fully adjusted). RESULTS: p53 mutations were found in 59% (36 of 61) and p53 protein accumulation was detected in 39% (24 of 61) of oesophageal cancers. Eighty eight per cent (23 of 26) of poorly differentiated tumours had p53 alterations compared with 57% (20 of 35) of moderate/well differentiated tumours (odds ratio (OR) = 5.575; p = 0.013). p53 mutations increased significantly with increasing consumption of hot beverages (measured by the average temperature of beverage, number consumed daily, and an index made by multiplying the two variables together) using both univariate (OR = 18.6; p = 0.0025) and multivariate (OR = 24.5; p = 0.0025) analysis. p53 alterations were associated with reduced disease free and overall survival (p = 0.051, log rank), with a univariate (unadjusted) hazard ratio (HR) of 2.241 (95% confidence limits (CL) = 0.973, 5.159; p = 0.058) for overall survival. By multivariate analysis adjusted for other relevant variables, the HR for tumours with p53 alterations was estimated at 2.913 (95% CL = 1.069, 7.936; p = 0.036) for overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports novel p53 mutations (exon 10), and an association between increasing consumption of hot beverages as a risk factor for p53 mediated oesophageal cancer. p53 is a potentially useful prognostic marker in this disease",

    "Title": "Analysis of the frequency of microsatellite instability and p53 gene mutation in splenic marginal zone and MALT lymphomas",
    "Abstract": "AIMS: Studies of the genetic characteristics of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) have failed to identify genetic changes specific to this tumour. Microsatellite instability is a type of genomic instability associated with different types of human cancer. Although microsatellite instability is rare in B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, it has been found in some specific subsets, such as marginal zone lymphomas arising in mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), where an association with p53 mutation has been described. Because it has been proposed that SMZL and MALT are close in histogenetic terms, this study investigated the comparative frequency of microsatellite instability and p53 mutation in patients with SMZL and MALT lymphomas. METHODS: Microsatellite instability was investigated using seven microsatellite marker loci in 14 patients with SMZL and 20 patients with MALT lymphomas. In an attempt to clarify the role of p53 gene mutation in the pathogenesis of SMZL, exons 5-8 were also investigated by polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR- SSCP) and direct sequencing in a total of 20 patients with SMZL and 22 patients with MALT lymphomas. RESULTS: Microsatellite instability was not detected in patients with SMZL, although five of 20 patients with MALT lymphomas had microsatellite instability. The frequency of p53 mutation was low in both series (two of 20 patients with SMZL and one of 22 patients with MALT lymphomas). No significant association was found between p53 mutation and microsatellite instability. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that microsatellite instability is not associated with the molecular pathogenesis of SMZL, confirming the relatively increased frequency of microsatellite instability in MALT lymphomas, and perhaps suggesting that MALT and SMZL have different mechanisms of tumorigenesis",

    "Abstract": "AIMS: Spontaneous apoptosis and expression of the apoptotic regulatory proteins Bax, Bcl-x, and Bcl-2 were investigated in 50 colorectal carcinomas. The p53 genotypes/phenotypes and BAX genotypes were also determined, and possible associations of these with apoptosis and/or with expression of the different apoptotic regulatory proteins were studied. METHODS: Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) mediated dUTP labelling of DNA fragments was used to detect apoptotic tumour cells in sections and peroxidase immunohistochemistry was used to assess protein expression. p53 genotype/phenotype was determined using constant denaturant gel electrophoresis/immunoblotting and bax genotype was determined using polymerase chain reaction based methods. RESULTS: The distribution of tumour apoptotic indices was bimodal with a natural cut off at 1.0% (range, 0.0-5.4%); the median fraction of apoptotic tumour cells was 0.8%. Tumour apoptosis was not associated significantly with tumour DNA ploidy status. Normal mucosal tissue had less than 0.1% apoptotic cells. Staining intensities for Bax, Bcl-x, and Bcl-2 were strong; that is, equivalent to or greater than positive normal mucosal cells, in 11 of 50, 20 of 49, and 20 of 48 carcinomas. Frameshift mutations in the bax gene were detected in three of 42 tumours analysed, all of which were DNA diploid, and Bax protein expression in these tumours was absent or very low. Bax, Bcl-x, and Bcl- 2 protein expression were not correlated with tumour apoptosis or tumour DNA ploidy status. p53 was expressed in 34 of 50 tumours and p53 gene mutations were detected in 22 of 29 p53 positive tumours analysed. Apoptosis was significantly lower in a greater number of p53 positive tumours than p53 negative tumours. In addition, Bcl-2 protein expression was significantly higher in a greater number of p53 positive tumours compared with p53 negative tumours. Bax and Bcl-x protein expression were not significantly associated with p53 phenotype/genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that acquisition of a p53 phenotype is associated with lower spontaneous apoptosis and higher expression of Bcl-2. The results also suggest that p53 is not a major determinant for Bax expression in colorectal carcinomas in vivo",

    "Abstract": "The p53 tumour suppressor gene is frequently mutated in oral squamous cell carcinomas. However, the downstream mechanism of p53 during oral carcinogenesis is not fully understood. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21), which can be induced by wild-type p53, functions as a downstream mediator of the antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing actions of wild-type p53. To learn more about the roles of the p53 gene and its downstream mechanism, we evaluated p53 gene mutation and immunohistochemical expression of p53 and p21 in 20 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma. p53 gene mutations were observed in 7 cases (35%). Overexpression of p53 was found in 4 of 13 cases with wild-type p53, and in 6 of 7 cases with p53 mutations. p21 expression was detected in 15 of 20 cases (75%). The expression of p21 correlated neither with mutated p53 mutation nor with p53 protein overexpression. p21 was expressed even in carcinomas in which molecular analysis revealed a nonsense mutation. In normal oral mucosa, p21 expression was limited in the differentiating spinous cell layer. However, dysplastic or hyperplastic epithelium adjacent to the tumour demonstrated the increased expression of p21 even in the proliferating basal cell layer. These molecular and immunohistochemical data did not show any correlation with various clinico-pathologic parameters. These results suggest that p53 gene mutations and altered expression of p21 are commonly involved in oral carcinogenesis, but do not correlate with each other or with the clinico-pathologic parameters. They also suggest that p21 expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas may be induced by a p53-independent pathway",

    "Abstract": "Accumulation of the p53 protein has been found in several types of lymphomas. However, p53 gene mutations have been infrequently demonstrated in some specific types of lymphomas. In the present study, a correlation between p53 immunoreactivity and p53 gene mutations in a large panel of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cases is attempted. A panel of 202 cases of NHL was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining for p53 protein. All cases that were immunohistochemically positive for p53 protein were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method to identify mutations within the p53 gene. In order to confirm the mutation, sequencing of PCR-amplified p53 gene segments was performed. Overexpression of p53 protein was found in 59 of the 202 cases of NHL, but only four of these 59 cases showed a shift on SSCP analysis, and point mutations were detected in three of them by the subsequent sequencing. p53 immunoreactivity was generally greater in high-grade lymphoma. The results of this study suggest that immunohistochemical reactivity for p53 protein is not a reliable indicator of the presence of their structural alterations of p53 gene exons 4-9 in NHL",

    "Abstract": "The present study is aimed to evaluate the genetic evidence for multicentricity of synchronous and metachronous multiple lung carcinomas. Nineteen cases of synchronous multiple lung carcinomas and 11 cases of metachronous multiple lung carcinomas were analyzed for p53 protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry (DO-7) and for genetic abnormality of the p53 gene by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 17p and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. They were also analyzed for K-ras mutation. DNA from three patients was also sequenced by the dideoxy sequencing method to confirm the presence of mutations and determine the base substitutions. Different spectrums of genetic changes, which were evaluated by a combination of p53 mutation, LOH at chromosome 17p and p53 overexpression, were observed in 11 of 19 cases of synchronous multiple lung carcinomas (57.9%) in the present study. Similarly, five of 11 cases of metachronous multiple lung carcinomas (45.4%) showed a different pattern of genetic changes. The present data suggest that some of the multiple carcinomas have different clonal origins, although their histological types are identical, and support the use of genetic markers in the differential diagnosis between metastasis and second primary carcinoma of the lung",

In a series of Japanese patients, eight of 27 (30%) samples of solar keratosis and three of six (50%) samples of squamous cell carcinoma showed structural abnormalities in the p53 gene. Only one solar keratosis (4%) showed a point mutation in the Ha-ras gene but not in the p53 gene. Among these cases, no mutation of ras genes could be detected in squamous cell carcinoma. Simultaneous mutation of ras genes and the p53 gene was not detected in any cases of either solar keratosis or squamous cell carcinoma. It is concluded that aberrations of the p53 gene and ras genes are induced through independent processes of ultraviolet irradiation in the course of carcinogenic change from solar keratosis to squamous cell carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Mutant p53 is frequently detected in endometrial and ovarian carcinoma, but it is rare in cervical cancers. Previous reports focused on cervical squamous cell carcinoma, whereas cervical adenocarcinoma was given little attention. We searched for p53 gene mutations in 74 primary cervical adenocarcinomas with known human papillomavirus (HPV) status. Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of p53 mutations and to investigate their possible role as an independent prognostic factor. We found mutations in 13.5% with a high rate of G:C --> A:T transitions as observed in endometrial adenocarcinoma. As p53 mutations are more frequently detected in malignancies of high grade, high stage, and large size, this molecular event seems to play a role in the progression rather than in the induction of cervical adenocarcinoma. In our series, patients with HPV-negative tumors and patients with mutated neoplasms, irrespective of HPV infection, had a shorter survival. Yet the absence of HPV infection and presence of p53 mutations are not independent risk factors for tumor-related death after adjustment for clinicopathological confounders. The only significant and independent predictors of survival are age of patient, stage of disease, tumor grade, and presence of lymph node metastases",

    "Abstract": "The endothelium is one of the largest cellular compartments of the human body and has a high proliferative potential. However, angiosarcomas are among the rarest malignancies. Despite this interesting contradiction, data on growth and angiogenesis control mechanisms of angiosarcomas are scarce. In this study of 19 angiosarcomas and 10 benign vascular control lesions we investigated the sequence and expression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and the expression of the mdm-2 proto-oncogene, which is a negative regulator of p53 activity and of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), whose expression, among other factors, is regulated by the p53/MDM-2 pathway. Ten sarcomas (53%) exhibited clear nuclear p53 protein accumulation. Two of these cases revealed mutations in the sequence- specific DNA binding domain of the p53 gene. Thirteen angiosarcomas (68%) showed an increased amount of MDM-2 protein. Elevated expression of p53 and MDM-2 protein correlated with increased VEGF expression, which was found in nearly 80% of the angiosarcoma cases. Negative or clearly lower immunostaining was obtained in cases from the benign control collective. Only one case of a juvenile hemangioma reached the cutoff value of p53 positivity coincidentally with high VEGF expression. Our data suggest that the p53/ MDM-2 pathway is impaired in about two-thirds (14/ 19) of the angiosarcomas. This may be a key event in the pathogenesis of human angiosarcomas. The increased VEGF expression observed supports this hypothesis",

    "Title": "Alterations of the p16-pRb pathway and the chromosome locus 9p21-22 in non-small-cell lung carcinomas: relationship with p53 and MDM2 protein expression",
    "Abstract": "The p16-pRb and p53-MDM2 pathways represent vital cell cycle checkpoints. Recent studies provide evidence that these pathways are directly linked via MDM2-pRb interaction and p53 suppression of the RB1 gene. In the present study we investigated the alterations of this G1 phase protein network using immunohistochemical and molecular methods in a series of 68 non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) and correlated the findings with clinicopathological features and prognosis of the patients. Aberrant expression (Ab) of p16 and pRb was observed in 33 (49%) and 27 (40%) of the carcinomas, respectively. Analysis of the region that encodes for p16 by deletion mapping, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methylation assay and PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis revealed that deletions and transcriptional silencing by methylation might represent the main mechanisms of CDKN2/p16ink4a inactivation in NSCLCs. The results of deletion mapping also suggest that other tumor suppressor genes may reside at the 9p21-22 region, which encodes for CDKN2/MTS1/p16ink4a, p14ARF, and MTS2/p15ink4b. In addition, microsatellite instability was observed with a frequency of 16% in the 9p21-22 chromosome area. Overexpression (P) of p53 and MDM2 proteins was found in 39 (58%) and 47 (70%) of the cases, respectively. A highly significant association was observed between p53 overexpression and p53 mutations (P = 0.006). Statistical analysis of the expression patterns of the biologically relevant molecules (p16/pRb, p53/MDM2, MDM2/pRb, and p53/pRb) showed coincident overexpression of p53 and MDM2 (P = 0.04) and that abnormal pRb was correlated with elevated levels of MDM2 (P = 0.013) and p53 (P = 0.01), respectively. We suggest that deregulated expression of these molecules may act synergistically. An important finding of the study was that multiple impairments (three and four molecules affected) of the p16/pRb/p53/MDM2 network occurred in a large proportion (43%) of the carcinomas. This finding in addition to the absence of correlation with clinical stage of the tumors suggests that multiple hits of this network may be a relatively early event in the development of a subset of NSCLCs. The relationship between the factors examined in the present study, clinicopathological features, and survival of the patients did not reveal any significant correlations with the exception of smoking, which was associated with microsatellite alterations (loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability) at the 9p21-22 locus (P = 0.04) and the immunophenotypes p53(P)/MDM2(P) (P = 0.04) and p16(Ab)/pRb(Ab)/p53(P)/MDM2(P) (P = 0.03), respectively. We suggest that in a subset of NSCLCs, simultaneous deregulation of the members of this network may represent one way of initiating the oncogenic procedure whereas in other NSCLC subgroups alternative pathways may play this role",

    "Abstract": "This study examined the association between 17p allelic loss, p53 gene mutation, p53 protein expression and DNA aneuploidy in a series of adenocarcinomas arising in the oesophagus and gastric cardia. 17p allelic loss was detected in 79% (15 of 19) of oesophageal and in 83% (29 of 35) of gastric adenocarcinomas. p53 mutations were detected in 70% (14 of 20) and 63% (26 of 41) of oesophageal and of gastric adenocarcinomas respectively. Both tumour types were associated with a predominance of base transitions at CpG dinucleotides. In five cases of oesophageal adenocarcinoma, the same mutation was detected both in tumour and in adjacent dysplastic Barrett's epithelium. Diffuse p53 protein expression was detected in 65% (13 of 20) and 59% (24 of 41) of oesophageal and of gastric tumours, respectively, and was associated with the presence of p53 missense mutation (Chi-squared, P < 0.0001). DNA aneuploidy was detected in 80% (16 of 20) of oesophageal and in 70% (28 of 40) of gastric tumours. No association was found between p53 or DNA content abnormalities and tumour stage or histological subtype. In conclusion, this study detected a similar pattern of p53 alterations in adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and gastric cardia--molecular data consistent with the observation that these tumours demonstrate similar clinical and epidemiological features",

    "Title": "Effects of p53 mutants derived from lung carcinomas on the p53- responsive element (p53RE) of the MDM2 gene",
    "Abstract": "The present study represents a continuation of previous works in which we observed that lung carcinomas co-expressing MDM2 protein and p53 mutants (mt p53) exhibited more aggressive behaviour. In the above studies, we suggested a 'gain of function' mechanism of mt p53 proteins based on the fact that the MDM2 gene possesses a p53-responsive element (MDM2-p53RE). In this study, to prove our hypothesis, we selected 12 cases from a series of 51 bronchogenic carcinomas. In these 12 cases, we examined the ability of the expressed mt p53 to bind the MDM2-p53RE and correlated the findings with MDM2 expression. Furthermore, we constructed four of these p53 mutants and studied their transactivation properties by co-transfecting them with a reporter plasmid carrying MDM2-p53RE in the p53 null non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell line (NSCLC) H1299. We observed mutant p53 protein DNA-binding activity, which depended on the nature and the position of the amino acid substitution. The fact that the cases with DNA-binding activity were accompanied with MDM2 protein isoforms' overexpression is indicative of a 'gain of function' phenotype. This hypothesis was enforced by the findings of the transfection experiments, which revealed that certain p53 mutants enhanced the expression of the luciferase reporter gene either directly or indirectly via a dominant positive effect on the wild-type p53. In conclusion, this work is one first attempt to examine if the deregulation of the p53/MDM2 autoregulatory feedback loop is due to novel properties of certain p53 mutants in the specific environment of a subset of bronchogenic carcinomas",

    "Title": "p53 mutation is a poor prognostic indicator for survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing surgical tumour ablation",
    "Abstract": "Forty-two patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were resected and their tumours were analysed for p53 mutations by GC-clamped denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and gene sequencing. All the exons have been analysed in this study. Eight of 12 HCCs with cirrhosis due to viral hepatitis and the two patients with sarcomatoid changes displayed p53 mutations. In contrast, no mutation was observed in the fibrolamellar variant (n = 9), non-cirrhotics (n = 13) and alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 6). The mutations observed were in exons 5-8. Two mutations were observed in codons 136 and 213 as well as a T insertion between residues 156 and 157 (exon 5) and these are reported for the first time in HCC. Likewise, the silent mutation polymorphism in codon 213 was noticed in 3 of the 42 patients. Survival analysis of these patients after surgery showed the mean and median survival in patients with wild-type p53 to be 60 and 43 months respectively. In the group with p53 mutations, the mean and median survival was 15 and 12 months. The difference was statistically significant (P= 0.003)",

    "Title": "Molecular pathogenesis of sporadic duodenal cancer",
    "Abstract": "Whether duodenal adenocarcinoma should be considered as a gastrointestinal or as a peripancreatic cancer is a matter of debate, as is the opportunity and type of treatment. We investigated 12 such cancers for the genetic anomalies involved in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal malignancies, including (a) those occurring in common-type cancers - allelic losses at chromosomes 3p, 5q, 17p and 18q, and Ki-ras and p53 alterations; and (b) those characteristic of mutator-phenotype cancers - microsatellite instability and TGF-betaRII gene mutations. We found Ki-ras and p53 mutations in five (42%) and eight cancers (67%), respectively; chromosome 3p, 5q, 17p and 18q allelic losses in two of nine (22%), six of ten (60%), six of nine (67%) and three of ten (30%) informative cancers, respectively. Finally, three cancers (25%) showed widespread microsatellite instability and two of them had a TGF-betaRII gene mutation. Our data suggest that duodenal cancers may arise from either of the two known pathogenetic molecular pathways of gastric and colorectal cancers. The majority of our cases were highly aggressive cancers with frequent chromosomal changes and p53 mutations as observed in the common-type gastrointestinal malignancies, while widespread subtle alterations characteristic of mutator-phenotype cancers occurred in a minority, which also showed a favourable long-term outcome",

    "Title": "Detection of TP53 mutation, loss of heterozygosity and DNA content in fine-needle aspirates of breast carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Recent preclinical and clinical data suggest that TP53 status and TP53 mutations may be important in determining tumour aggressiveness and therapy response. In this study we investigate the feasibility of a structural and quantitative analysis of TP53 on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) material obtained from 31 consecutive female patients with breast carcinoma, enrolled in a primary chemotherapy protocol. Tumours were screened for p53 protein overexpression and TP53 mutations (exons 5-8) using immunocytochemistry, polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequencing analyses, and finally using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Positive nuclear staining was identified in six cases whereas mutations were detected in nine. Although the immunoreactive pattern fitted fully with the characterized TP53 mutation type, the considerable number of null p53 mutations (i.e. four) coupled with the lack of information regarding the localization of TP53 mutations make immunocytochemistry an inadequate indicator of TP53 function deregulation. Combining molecular and FISH analyses, we detected three cases with TP53 deletion and one case with deletion and mutation. Finally, DNA static-image analysis performed on 29 cases showed aneuploidy in 26 cases, which included all TP53-mutated cases. The present results show that FNA may assist clinical decisions by allowing the evaluation of a variety of biological parameters relevant for prognosis and treatment planning",

    "Title": "Mutations in the TP53 gene and protein expression of p53, MDM 2 and p21/WAF-1 in primary cervical carcinomas with no or low human papillomavirus load",
    "Abstract": "Several studies have focused on the role of p53 inactivation in cervical cancer, either by inactivating mutations in the TP53 gene or by degradation of the p53 protein by human papillomavirus (HPV). In this study, primary cervical carcinomas from 365 patients were analysed for presence of HPV using both consensus primer-sets and type-specific primer-sets. Nineteen samples were determined to have no or low virus load, and were selected for further analyses: mutation screening of the TP53 gene using constant denaturant gel electrophoresis (CDGE) followed by sequencing, and protein expression of p53, MDM2 and p21 using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Mutations in the TP53 gene were found in eight samples (42%). Elevated p53 protein expression was significantly associated with presence of a mutation (P < 0.007). P21 protein expression was detected in 16 of the 19 carcinomas. No p21 expression was seen in normal cervical tissue. Two samples, both with wild-type p53, had elevated MDM2 expression. Compared with a previous study from our group, of mainly HPV-positive cervical carcinomas, in which only one sample was found to contain a TP53 mutation, a significantly higher mutation frequency (P < 0.001) was found among the carcinomas with no or low virus load. Although p53 inactivation pathways are not detected in every tumour, our study supports the hypothesis that p53 inactivation, either by binding to cellular or viral proteins or by mutation, is essential in the development of cervical carcinomas",

    "Title": "Alterations of TP53 in microdissected transitional cell carcinoma of the human urinary bladder: high frequency of TP53 accumulation in the absence of detected mutations is associated with poor prognosis",
    "Abstract": "We have used microdissection of paraffin-embedded histological sections and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based direct DNA sequencing for 54 transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, to examine critically the association between TP53 nuclear accumulation determined by immunohistochemistry and the presence of TP53 mutations, and to examine their relationship to tumour stage and grade, as well as patient survival. There was a significant association between the presence of TP53-positive nuclei (> 10%) and a higher histological stage and grade (P = 0.0115, P = 0.0151 respectively; Fisher's exact). A significant association between TP53 gene mutations and TP53 nuclear reactivity in more than 10% of tumour cell nuclei was also observed (P = 0.0003; Fisher's exact). Mutations were detected in 18/54 (33%) cases together with the wild-type sequence when analysed from bulk frozen samples, with significant clustering of mutations in exons 7 and 8. The microdissection method distinguished more clearly between heterozygous and/or homozygous alterations of the TP53 tumour-suppressor gene, and clearly showed frequent accumulation of TP53 in the absence of mutations. When microdissecting immunonegative regions from the same paraffin sections, three out of ten samples showed the identical mutations detected in the immunopositive regions. There was a significant association between TP53 immunoreactivity in more than 50% of tumour cell nuclei and decreased survival among all patients (P = 0.0325; log-rank test). The patients with TP53 mutations showed a trend for a shorter survival period; however, the association was not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (P = 0.132; log- rank test). In conclusion, our observations show that accumulation of TP53 occurs frequently in the absence of mutations, and that such accumulation is nevertheless associated with poor survival when it occurs in a high proportion (> 50%) of tumour cell nuclei",

    "Title": "Mutations in residues of TP53 that directly contact DNA predict poor outcome in human primary breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "The tumour-suppressor gene TP53 is frequently mutated in breast tumours, and the majority of the mutations are clustered within the core domain, the region involved in DNA binding. We searched for alterations in this central domain of the TP53gene in 222 human breast cancer specimens using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation analysis (PCR-SSCA) followed by sequencing. TP53 gene mutations were observed in 66 tumours (31%), including three tumours that contain two mutations. Fifty-four (78%) of these mutations were missense point mutations, one was a nonsense mutation and four were deletions and/or insertions causing disruption of the protein reading frame, whereas four mutations were either silent or a polymorphism (at codon 213; n = 6). Interestingly, the majority of missense mutations were observed at codon 248. The outcome has been related with patient and tumour characteristics, and with prognosis in 177 patients who were eligible for analysis of both relapse-free and overall survival (median survival for patients alive was 115 months). There was no significant association between the frequency of TP53 mutations and menopausal or nodal status, or tumour size. In a Cox univariate analysis, TP53 gene mutation was significantly associated with poor relapse-free survival (RFS: P = 0.02) but not with overall survival (OS: P = 0.07). In a Cox multivariate analysis, including classical prognostic factors, TP53 gene mutation independently predicted poor RFS and OS (RHR = 1.8 and 1.6 respectively). Unexpectedly, the median relapse-free survival of patients with a polymorphism at codon 213 or with a silent mutation was shorter (median 11 months) than the median relapse-free survival of patients with or without a TP53 gene mutation (median 34 or 48 months respectively). In an exploratory subset analysis, mutations in codons that directly contact DNA were related with the poorest relapse-free (P < 0.05) and overall survival (P < 0.02). These data imply that in the analysis of the prognostic value of TP53, the type of mutation and its biological function should be considered",

    "Title": "Genetic analysis of lung tumours of non-smoking subjects: p53 gene mutations are constantly associated with loss of heterozygosity at the FHIT locus",
    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is strictly associated with tobacco smoking. Tumours developed in non-smoking subjects account for less than 10% of all lung cancers and show peculiar histopathological features, being prevalently adenocarcinomas. A number of genetic data suggest that their biological behaviour may be different from that of lung tumours caused by smoking, however the number of cases investigated to date is too low to draw definitive conclusions. We have examined the status of p53 and K-ras genes and the presence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the FHIT locus in a series of 35 lung adenocarcinomas that developed in subjects who had never smoked. Results were compared with those obtained in a series of 35 lung adenocarcinomas from heavy-smoking subjects. In the group of non-smoking subjects p53 mutations and LOH at the FHIT locus were present in seven (20%) cases, and the two alterations were constantly associated (P < 0.0001), whereas they were not related in the series of carcinomas caused by smoking. In tumours developed in heavy-smoking subjects, the frequency of LOH at the FHIT locus was significantly higher (P = 0.006) than in tumours from non-smoking subjects. The frequency of p53 mutations in adenocarcinomas caused by smoking was not different from that seen in non-smoking subjects. However, in the group of smoking subjects we observed mostly G:C --> T:A transversions, whereas frameshift mutations and G:C --> A:T transitions were more frequently found in tumours from non-smoking subjects. No point mutations of the K-ras gene at codon 12 were seen in subjects who had never smoked, whereas they were present (mostly G:C -- > T:A transversions) in 34% of tumours caused by smoking (P = 0.002). Our data suggest that lung adenocarcinomas developed in subjects who had never smoked represent a distinct biological entity involving a co- alteration of the p53 gene and the FHIT locus in 20% of cases",

    "Abstract": "Exposure to aromatic amines is considered a major risk factor for the development of bladder cancer. In this study, we have analysed the pattern of point mutations in several tumour genes in 21 cases of bladder cancer arising among western European workers exposed to aromatic amines in an attempt to determine whether this exposure may be associated with a unique spectrum of mutations. Of the four genes analysed (p53, p16MTS1, p21WAF1 and H-ras), only p53 showed a high frequency of mutations (in 8 out of 21 cases, 38%). Two mutations were found in p16, one in H-ras and none in p21 exon 3. All mutations were at G:C base pairs, mostly at non-CpG residues. This spectrum of mutations, which is highly suggestive of an involvement of exogenous carcinogens, is however identical to the spectrum of p53 mutations detected in bladder cancers of the general population. In exposed workers, p53 mutations were associated with tumour grade and with high occupational and tobacco exposure. Taken together, our data suggest that the same carcinogens may be responsible for the development of bladder cancers in workers exposed to aromatic amines and in the general population",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in non-small-cell lung cancers occurring in individuals without a past history of active smoking",
    "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that the p53 gene is a good target for molecular epidemiological studies. We previously reported an association between the presence of p53 mutations and lifetime cigarette consumption. Although over 675 p53 mutations have been reported in lung cancers in the literature thus far, very little is known about the nature of such changes in lung cancers in the absence of a smoking background. In the present study, we therefore analysed 69 non-small-cell lung cancer specimens from individuals without any history of active smoking and identified p53 mutations in 26% of the cases. Statistical analysis of the present cohort of non-smokers also showed absence of significant relationship between p53 mutations and age, sex, histological type or disease stage. Comparison of mutational spectra between the present results in non-smokers and previously reported mutations in smokers clearly demonstrated G:C to T:A transversions to be significantly less frequent in non-smokers than in smokers (OR 5.35, 95% CI 1.77-16.12). Interestingly, G:C to C:G and G:C to A:T mutations were also observed in tumours of non-smokers at similar frequencies to G:C to T:A mutations, suggesting that these mutations can occur relatively frequently in the absence of active smoking. This study is, to our knowledge, the largest so far analysing a well-defined cohort of non-smokers in a single laboratory",

    "Abstract": "Cell death after treatment with chemotherapy is exerted by activation of apoptosis, and the p53 protein has been shown to actively participate in this process. This recent focus on TP53 status as a possible determinant of cancer therapy response has raised the question of whether or not mutations in the TP53 gene have an influence on paclitaxel therapy. The TP53 status has been analysed at the DNA level in tumours from 45 ovarian cancer patients randomized to treatment with paclitaxel and cisplatin or cyclophosphamide and cisplatin. Therapy response was obtained for 38 patients with clinically evaluable disease after initial surgery. The positive response rate to the paclitaxel/cisplatin therapy was 85% vs 61% for the patients who received the cyclophosphamide/cisplatin regimen. A significant difference in relapse-free survival in favour of paclitaxel/cisplatin chemotherapy was found (P = 0.001). A total of 33 tumour samples (73%) had detectable sequence alterations in the TP53 gene. When relapse-free survival was estimated for all patients with TP53 alterations in their tumours, a significant better outcome for the paclitaxel/cisplatin group was found compared with the patient group receiving cyclophosphamide and cisplatin therapy (P = 0.002). We did not observe an association between TP53 tumour status and prognosis for patients who received paclitaxel/cisplatin combination treatment, indicating that the effect of this therapy is not influenced by this parameter",

This correlation suggests the hypothesis that oncogenes and tumour suppressors regulate VEGF, and a significant correlation between p53 alteration and increased VEGF expression in human lung cancer was reported recently. To further examine this hypothesis, we analysed VEGF protein expression and mutations in p53 and K-ras in 27 non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC): 16 squamous cell, six adenocarcinomas, one large cell, two carcinoids and two undifferentiated tumours. VEGF was expressed in 50% of the squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and carcinoids but none of the others. p53 mutations occurred in 14 tumours (52%), and K-ras mutations were found in two adenocarcinomas and one SCC; there was no correlation between the mutations and VEGF expression. As nitric oxide also regulates angiogenesis, we examined NOS expression in NSCLC. The Ca2+- dependent NOS activity, which indicates NOS1 and NOS3 expression, was significantly reduced in lung carcinomas compared with adjacent non- tumour tissue (P < 0.004). Although the Ca2+-independent NOS activity, which indicates NOS2 expression, was low or undetectable in non-tumour tissues and most carcinomas, significant activity occurred in three SCC. In summary, our data do not show a direct regulation of VEGF by p53 in NSCLC. Finally, we did not find the up-regulation of NOS isoforms during NSCLC progression that has been suggested for gynaecological and breast cancers",

Archival tissue from 77 tumours was analysed for protein expression using immunohistochemistry (IHC) with the monoclonal antibody Do-7, and for the presence of mutation in exons 5-8 using single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP), followed by DNA sequencing in SSCP- positive cases. p53 expression was scored as high (>70% nuclei stained) in 25 (32%) tumours, as intermediate (10-70% nuclei stained) in 19 (25%) tumours and as low (<10% nuclei stained) in 33 (43%) tumours. Twelve (18%) tumours exhibited gene mutation (ten missense and two nonsense mutations) and an additional five tumours contained changes that could not result in amino acid substitution or protein truncation. There was no correlation between gene expression and mutation, mutations being equally frequent in tumours with either high (4/25), intermediate (4/19) or low protein expression (4/33). Fifty-eight patients were eligible for survival analysis. There was a strong correlation between p53 mutation and cause-specific survival; median survival among mutated cases was 12.5 months compared with >160 months among non-mutated patients (P < 0.005). There was no correlation between p53 overexpression and survival. The results suggest that p53 mutation status is an important prognostic factor in HNSCC, and that IHC analysis of protein overexpression is an inadequate measure of gene mutation in these tumours",

    "Title": "Wt-p53 action in human leukaemia cell lines corresponding to different stages of differentiation",
    "Abstract": "Recent studies support the potential application of the wt-p53 gene in cancer therapy. Expression of exogenous wt-p53 suppresses a variety of leukaemia phenotypes by acting on cell survival, proliferation and/or differentiation. As for tumour gene therapy, the final fate of the neoplastic cells is one of the most relevant points. We examined the effects of exogenous wt-p53 gene expression in several leukaemia cell lines to identify p53-responsive leukaemia. The temperature-sensitive p53Val135 mutant or the human wt-p53 cDNA was transduced in leukaemia cell lines representative of different acute leukaemia FAB subtypes, including M1 (KG1), M2 (HL-60), M3 (NB4), M5 (U937) and M6 (HEL 92.1.7), as well as blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (BC-CML: K562, BV173) showing diverse differentiation features. By morphological, molecular and biochemical analyses, we have shown that exogenous wt-p53 gene expression induces apoptosis only in cells corresponding to M1, M2 and M3 of the FAB classification and in BC-CML showing morphological and cytochemical features of undifferentiated blast cells. In contrast, it promotes differentiation in the others. Interestingly, cell responsiveness was independent of the vector used and the status of the endogenous p53 gene",

The occurrence rate for p53 mutations and the absence of p16 mutations in MFH-b are comparable to the findings for MFH of soft tissues (MFH-st) and osteosarcomas, suggesting that p53 rather than p16 may play a role in tumorigenesis of MFH-b",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations in rectal cancer associated with schistosomiasis japonica in Chinese patients",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in p53 tumor suppressor gene were examined in 44 Chinese patients with rectal cancer, including 22 cases with advanced schistosomiasis japonica and 22 cases without schistosomiasis. In schistosomal rectal cancer (SRC), 13 mutations were found in 10 cases, which included 11 base-pair substitutions and two deletions. Of 11 base substitutions, nine were transitions and two were transversions and seven of them were located at CpG dinucleotides. In non-schistosomal rectal cancer (NSRC), 13 mutations were found in nine cases, all of which were base-pair substitutions. Of 13 substitutions, 10 were transitions and three were transversions and three of them were located at CpG dinucleotides. The proportion of base-pair substitutions at CpG dinucleotides was higher in SRC patients than in NSRC patients, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.054). Point mutation was frequent at codon 248 in SRC. A higher frequency of arginine missense mutations was observed in SRC than in NSRC. These observations suggest that the mutations in SRC are the result of genotoxic agents produced endogenously through the course of schistosomiasis japonica",

    "Title": "p53 inactivating mutations in Chinese nasopharyngeal carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Previously a low frequency of p53 mutations was detected in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) using molecular techniques to screen for mutations, yet immunohistochemical staining revealed a high frequency of p53 aberrant proteins. These findings might be attributed to the occurrence of p53 mutations outside the common hot spots and/or the inactivation of the protein through interactions with cellular or viral proteins. Using a previously established simple and sensitive p53 yeast functional assay, we blindly screened 25 nasopharyngeal biopsies for p53 mutations from exons 4 to 11. p53 was mutated in 27.3% of NPC specimens and in 0% of the nasopharyngeal biopsies from patients with non-malignant diseases. Two p53 mutations were detected in exon 7 and two were detected in exon 8. Interestingly, the exon 8 mutations observed in NPC lie in codons which appear to be hot spots for mutations in other head and neck cancers",

    "Abstract": "Turcot's syndrome is a rare heritable complex that is characterized by an association between a primary neuroepithelial tumor of the central nervous system and multiple colonic polyps. The aim of this study was to analyze genetic alterations in a case of Turcot's syndrome in a 10.5- year-old boy in whom a colorectal tumor developed 3.5 years following astrocytoma. An APC germline non-sense mutation at codon 1284 leading to a truncated protein was identified, as was a somatic p53 mutation in the colorectal carcinoma in exon 7, codon 244. The latter was not identified in the primary astrocytoma. However, immunohistochemistry revealed high p53 protein expression in both tumors, suggesting an additional p53 mutation in the primary astrocytic tumor. The diverse p53 mutations observed in this unique syndrome in two different sites and stages of the disease may shed light on the multistep progression of the malignant events",

    "Abstract": "Paired colorectal liver metastases (CLM) and normal tissue samples from a consecutive series of 36 patients were studied prospectively. MIB-1 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections. DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) measurements were performed by flow cytometry on frozen tissues. Mutations within the p53 (exons 5-8) and c-Ki-ras (codons 12 and 13) genes were detected by PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by sequencing. A high correlation was observed between the MIB-1 LI and SPF value (rho=0.81; P<0.01). Moreover, p53 gene mutations were associated with either high MIB-1 LI and high SPF. In univariate analysis, SPF and MIB-1 levels were related to risk of death. The association between overall survival and DNA-ploidy or p53 mutations did not reach statistical significance, but a slightly better survival was observed for patients either with DNA-diploid tumours or without mutations (P=0.05 and P=0.06, respectively). SPF was shown by multivariate Cox model analysis to be an independent prognostic variable and thus it might be a useful prognostic factor in patients with CLM",

    "Title": "Expression of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 proteins in gastric and esophageal cancers: comparison with mutations of the p53 gene",
    "Abstract": "The p53 gene has been shown to be commonly mutated in various human cancers, and mutant p53 can act as a dominant oncogene. The intact p53 protein is also known to induce the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 and is implicated in cell cycle arrest. We investigated p53 gene alterations in gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to elucidate the association of the nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein and/or p21WAF1/CIP1 protein. Abnormalities of the tumor suppressor gene p53 protein and the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 protein were analyzed by immunohistochemical techniques in 32 cases of gastric adenocarcinoma and 15 cases of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Twenty cases of gastric cancer and five cases of esophageal cancer were also analyzed for p53 gene mutation by polymerase chain reaction and direct nucleotide sequencing. Overexpression of p53 protein was found in 13/32 (41%) of gastric cancers and 5/15 (33%) of esophageal cancers. We found immunodetectable p53 in 10/14 cases with mutations and in none of 11 cases without mutations in gastric and esophageal cancers. Hence, immunohistochemical and genetic analyses gave concordant results in 84% of 25 cases, revealing a good correlation between immunostaining of p53 and missense mutation of the p53 gene. p53 immunostaining was not observed in cases with frameshift or splicing mutation. The expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 protein was found in 9/32 (29%) of gastric cancers and 4/15 (27%) of esophageal cancers and in 2/14 (14%) cases with alteration of the p53 gene and in 5/11 (45%) without. These results suggest that abnormalities of p53 may be closely associated with the pathogenesis of gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and that the immunoreactivity of p53 protein is a general indicator of the tumors with altered p53 function. The expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 protein was suppressed in the neoplastic tissues with and without p53 gene alteration",

    "Abstract": "This study investigated a total number of 120 colorectal malignant tumor tissues by applying a new quantitative luminometric assay (LIA)- mat, immunohistochemistry (IHC) (n=100), PCR/SSCP (n=42), and sequencing (n=7). Sera were collected from 235 patients suffering from colorectal carcinoma in addition to 195 healthy individuals as a control group. Manual ELISA kit was developed to detect p53 autoantibodies in the sera of those patients. Our data demonstrated that the LIA-mat yields reliable estimates of p53 expression in soluble cell extracts as compared with results obtained by immunohistochemistry which showed positive immunostaining in 63% of the studied cases. Using a cut-off value of 1.8 ng/mg protein, 65 tumors out of 120 (54%) were classified to be positive by LIA-mat, manifesting protein overexpression, while 22 out of 42 (52%) tumor samples showed p53 gene alteration when applying single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis on polymerase chain reaction products. In tumor samples without a p53 gene alteration, the median soluble p53 protein level was 4.3 ng/mg protein, whereas the median p53 protein level for tumor samples with p53 gene alteration was 7.5 times higher. Despite a significant correlation between the outcome of LIA and SSCP, a disagreement was found in 30% of cases. We found no significant correlation between p53 protein overexpression and clinicopathological findings except for distant metastasis (p=0.33), indicating p53 immunoreactivity to be an independent prognostic factor. Our data showed that 18% of patients suffering from colorectal cancer developed autoantibodies against p53 in their sera which might be an early indicator for tumor development and distant metastasis",

    "Title": "p53 alterations and HPV infections are common in oral SCC: p53 gene mutations correlate with the absence of HPV 16-E6 DNA",
    "Abstract": "To examine the association between HPV infections and p53 gene aberrations, a panel of 28 oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 12 potentially malignant oral mucosal lesions were analysed for p53 mutations in exons 2-9. p53 protein was analysed by immunocytochemistry using DO7 antibody. The same panel was also examined for the possible presence of HPV infection. p53 overexpression was detected in 13/26 (50%) malignant and 2/9 (22%) premalignant lesions. Mutations in the coding region of the p53 gene were found in 10 malignant samples. None of the premalignant lesions were shown to have p53 mutations. The total number of p53 mutations in 10 samples were 14 of which 12 (85%) were in exon 5 suggesting the presence of hot spots in exon 5 for carcinogens involved in the transformation of oral epithelial cells. The presence of HPV DNA was first screened with consensus primers to the L1 region and nested PCR approach. HPV 6 and HPV 16 were detected in 14/28 (50%) oral SCC and 4 of 12 (33%) precancerous lesions, 7 tumours harboured both types. The samples were then examined for the presence of E6 oncogenic sequence of HPV16 using E6 specific primers. 7/27 (26%) SCC and 5/9 (55%) premalignant lesions harboured E6 DNA of which 6 (3 SCC and 3 pre-malignant) were negative with L1 primers suggesting possible integration of the specific viral genes or loss of other viral DNA sequences after integration of larger viral fragments. 9/10 (90%) SCC with p53 mutations were negative for E6 DNA. Our results show that both p53 alterations and HPV infection may be important etiological factors in the development of oral cancer. However, there is: i) No concordance between p53 mutations and its overexpression. ii) the presence of HPV capsid DNA (L1) does not necessarily indicate the presence of HPV oncogenic genes. iii) p53 gene mutations, but not overexpression, correlate with the absence of HPV 16-E6 and not L1 gene",

    "Abstract": "It is occasionally difficult to differentiate between multiple primary and metastatic tumors in case of multiple carcinomas. p53 gene mutation pattern by PCR-SSCP and a clonality analysis on the human androgen receptor gene (HUMARA) in multiple tumors were used to distinguish whether carcinomas were multiple primary tumors or a metastasis. Three female patients with multiple carcinomas, who had undergone surgical resection, were selected for these analyses as typical candidates from 11 cases tested. In the first case with bilateral breast cancer the combined analyses were performed on DNA extracted from tumor portions in paraffin sections of each tumor sample and the results indicated that the carcinomas consisted of a primary carcinoma and metastatic tumors. The carcinomas in the second patient consisted of multiple primary carcinomas and the tumors in the third patient consisted of two independent primary carcinomas with different clonal origins. Thus a combination of p53 gene mutation analysis and clonality analysis on HUMARA provided useful, reliable evidence which can help in discriminating multiple primary tumors from metastatic tumors",

    "Abstract": "A human cell line LMS6-93 has been established from a leiomyosarcoma (LMS). Characteristics for ultrastructure, growth characteristics, cell cycle distribution, karyotype, protein expression detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), p53 mutational status and liposomal transfection behaviour were studied and determined. The primary tumor was clearly positive for a-smooth muscle type actin and desmin in moderately differentiated areas and indicated a loss of myogenic differentiation in other regions and therefore was classified as a poorly differentiated LMS. The cell line LMS6-93 contains mainly polymorphic spindle shaped or polygonal tumor cells which possess the characteristics of primitive mesenchymal cells, based on their morphology and positive reaction with an antibody to vimentin. IHC staining for S100, synaptophysin A, NSE, neurofilament proteins and cytokeratins were negative. Cytogenetic analysis revealed in the cell line diploid karyotypes comparatively close to several structural and numerical aberrations for chromosomes 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20, 22, and Y. IHC positivity was found for the tumor suppressor protein Rb and the oncogene product MDM2. In a p53 mutational analysis a 1 bp insertional mutation in exon 6 (G insertion in codon 215) was detected and confirmed in the original primary tumor. The other p53 allele appears to be wild-type as indicated in Western hybridization. Using different cationic lipid formulations complexed with a reporter expression vector (GFP) successful transfection into LMS6-93 cells was observed. The highest transfection rates (20-30% GFP expression in the viable cell population) were obtained with lipofectin. These results suggest that LMS6-93 functions as a good in vitro model for transfection studies on an LMS cell line carrying a heterozygous p53- frameshift mutation",

    "Title": "Frequent inactivation of CDKN2A and rare mutation of TP53 in PCNSL",
    "Abstract": "Twenty primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) from immunocompetent patients (nineteen B-cell lymphomas and one T-cell lymphoma) were investigated for genetic alterations and/or expression of the genes BCL2, CCND1, CDK4, CDKN1A, CDKN2A, MDM2, MYC, RB1, REL, and TP53. The gene found to be altered most frequently was CDKN2A. Eight tumors (40%) showed homozygous and two tumors (10%) hemizygous CDKN2A deletions. Furthermore, methylation analysis of six PCNSL without homozygous CDKN2A loss revealed methylation of the CpG island within exon 1 of CDKN2A in three instances. Reverse transcription PCR analysis of CDKN2A mRNA expression was performed for 11 tumors and showed either no or weak signals. Similarly, immunocytochemistry for the CDKN2A gene product (p16) remained either completely negative or showed expression restricted to single tumor cells. None of the PCNSL showed amplification of CDK4. Similarly, investigation of CCND1 revealed no amplification, rearrangement or overexpression. The retinoblastoma protein was strongly expressed in all tumors. Only one PCNSL showed a mutation of the TP53 gene, i.e., a missense mutation at codon 248 (CGG to TGG:Arg to Trp). No evidence of BCL2 gene rearrangement was found in 11 tumors investigated. The bcl-2 protein, however, was strongly expressed in most tumors. None of the 20 PCNSL demonstrated gene amplification of MDM2, MYC or REL. In summary, inactivation of CDKN2A by either homozygous deletion or DNA methylation represents an important molecular mechanism in PCNSL. Mutation of the TP53 gene and alterations of the other genes investigated appear to be of minor significance in these tumors",

    "Title": "Heterogeneous point mutations of the p53 gene in pulmonary fibrosis",
    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is a frequent complication in pulmonary fibrosis. Overexpression of p53 proteins has been demonstrated by immunostaining in bronchoepithelial cells in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, it is still unclear whether this overexpressed p53 protein is wild-type or mutant. It was hypothesized that pulmonary fibrosis may be a precancerous lesion with deoxyribonucleic acid point mutations in bronchoepithelial cells. Mutations of the p53 gene were tested for by fluorescence-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (FSSCP), cloning-sequencing and immunostaining techniques. Out of 10 tissue samples that demonstrated overexpression of p53 protein by immunostaining, nine (90%) exhibited point mutations and eight (80%) exhibited heterogeneous point mutations of the p53 gene. The mutations found in pulmonary fibrosis were scattered throughout the central part of the p53 gene, and both guanine (G):cytosine (C) to adenine (A):thymine (T) and A:T to G:C transitions were frequently observed. In conclusion, frequent heterogeneous point mutations of the p53 gene were detected in pulmonary fibrosis. These mutations may have resulted from several types of deoxyribonucleic acid damage that occurred in bronchoepithelial cells and this may explain previous findings of a very high incidence of lung cancer complicating pulmonary fibrosis",

Single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses followed by direct DNA sequencing revealed that 5 carcinomas (31%) contained a p53 mutation, 4 of which were G:C-->A:T transition mutations and 1 of which was a deletion. Three G:C-->A:T mutations were located at dipyrimidine sequences on the antisense strand (2 spiradenocarcinomas, 1 eccrine hidradenocarcinoma), suggesting that UV light may play a role in the development of sweat gland carcinomas. In 2 spiradenocarcinomas, p53 mutations were present in the carcinoma but not in the adenoma portions, suggesting that p53 mutations may be associated with malignant progression in these rare adnexal tumours",

Altogether 13% of the primary tumors showed strong p53 staining using the DO-7 antibody. Different results were obtained with other antibodies. Seven mutations were found in primary and metastatic tumors; all of these were single base changes, most of which occurred in the core domain of the p53 protein responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding (residues 102-293). The mutations were not significantly associated with p53 staining results, and p53 alterations (mutations or marked immunopositivity) had no prognostic value. Our results indicate that point mutations in exons 7 and 8 are more frequent than previously reported in primary melanomas, and such changes may be important for the development of certain melanoma subgroups",

    "Abstract": "In this study we investigated the incidence of mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the TP53 gene in DNA samples from paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue from 90 patients with untreated squamous- cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Evidence for TP53 mutations were demonstrated in 53% (48/90) of the cases analyzed. All cases were also examined for loss of heterozygosity, using a PCR-based polymorphic marker at TP53. LOH was found in 36 out of 72 (50%) informative cases. Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed in 45 cases with evidence of mutations. The sequencing results revealed the presence of base-substitutions (67%), deletions (29%) and insertions (4%). Of the base-substitutions, 70% were transitions and 30% were transversions. Demographic variables, tumor site, stage (TNM), family history of cancer, lymph-node involvement and histological grade were not important predictors of TP53 mutations. Nor did TP53 genetic alterations correlate with survival status. In conclusion, we show that TP53 genetic alterations are frequent in head-and-neck tumors, but are not associated with clinicopathological variables or disease progression. Our study provides an evaluation of the spectrum of TP53 mutations in the pathogenesis of head-and-neck carcinoma in Brazil",

    "Abstract": "Oral squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common neoplasm in Sri Lanka, accounting for approximately 30% of all cancers in males. Epidemiologic evidence indicates that there is an unequivocal relationship between betel chewing and oral carcinogenesis, suggesting that there may be specific genetic targets of betel-quid ingredients. The p53 gene has been indicated to be a tumor-suppressor gene that is found in mutated form in common human cancers; however, there are few reports about 'carcinogen-specific' p53 mutation. Because of this background, primary resected specimens from 23 oral SCCs, 7 leukoplakias and 2 oral submucous fibrosis were collected from oral SCC patients in Sri Lanka and were used for p53 mutation analysis. Exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene were examined by polymerase chain reaction- single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing. Mutations in the p53 gene were frequent (10/23) in oral SCC specimens from Sri Lanka. Moreover, the mutations clustered significantly in exon 5 (7/10) of the p53 gene, and small deletions and inclusions other than point mutations were observed. These results indicate that 1) betel-quid chewing may cause specific genetic changes, including mutation in the p53 gene; 2) mutations in the p53 gene are not rare events in SCC patients who are betel-quid chewers, which contrasts with other reports; 3) exon 5 of the p53 gene could be one of the specific targets for some betel-quid ingredients; and 4) betel-quid chewing may be a critical environmental factor in the development of oral SCC",

    "Title": "High prevalence of codon 213Arg-->Stop mutations of the TP53 gene in human ovarian cancer in the southwestern part of The Netherlands",
    "Abstract": "As in many human malignancies, TP53 mutations are the most common genetic alterations in malignant human ovarian tumours. An approach often used in the determination of TP53 status is immunohistochemical staining of the protein. Non-missense mutations, especially those of the null type, causing premature termination codons and resulting in truncated proteins, may often not be detectable by immunohistochemistry. Therefore, current estimates of TP53 alterations in ovarian cancer may be inaccurate. By using polymerase chain reaction- single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing techniques, we have found a high prevalence of TP53 non-missense mutations in exons 5-8 in ovarian tumour specimens from patients from the southwestern part of The Netherlands. Twenty-nine of 64 tumours showed mutations, of which 10 were non-missense mutations. The majority (9 of 10) of these non-missense mutations, including 7 nonsense mutations and 2 frameshift deletions, were null type mutations and could not be detected by immunohistochemical staining. Five of the 7 nonsense mutations were mutations at codon 213 (Arg-->Stop). The nature of the high prevalence of this nonsense mutation in our series of ovarian carcinomas remains unknown. In addition to the 9 null type mutations, a splice junction mutation was encountered. In conclusion, we have observed a high prevalence (13%) of ovarian tumours with null type mutations in exons 5-8 that did not result in immunostaining. Our data suggest that, especially in ovarian cancer, immunological assessment of TP53 is not an adequate tool to study TP53 alteration. A frequent nonsense mutation at codon 213 in 5 (8%) of 64 tumour specimens represents an important finding",

    "Title": "Human papillomavirus DNA and p53 status in penile carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Our study aimed at evaluating the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in a series of 84 paraffin-embedded (PET) penile carcinomas. We have also investigated the presence of p53 mutations in these tumors by immunohistochemistry (IHC), single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. Tissues were submitted to amplification of a 268 bp fragment from the beta-globin gene and a fragment of the E6 gene of HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18. Twenty samples (18 fixed in Bouin's solution and 2 in buffered formalin) were found inadequate and were excluded from the analysis. In the remaining 64 tumors, HPV DNA was found in 26% of the samples. The prevalence of HPV in fresh samples of the same tumors was 56%. The most prevalent type was HPV 16 in both fresh samples and PET. Isotopic in situ hybridization was performed in all PET samples, but only 2 cases were positive, 1 for HPV 16 and 1 for HPV 18. Immunohistochemistry with anti- p53 pAb 1801 antibody showed a positive nuclear reaction over more than 5% of tumor cells in 26% of the cases. SSCP of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene was performed on 9 HPV-positive and 12 HPV-negative specimens. Abnormal mobility was found in 26% of the tumors, of which 2 were HPV- positive and 5 HPV-negative. Point mutations were detected in p53 exons 6 (1 case), 7 (1 case) and 8 (5 cases), showing that high-risk type HPVs and mutated p53 may coexist in these tumors. Our data indicate that a subset of penile carcinomas are etiologically related to HPV and that an overlapping subset may arise from mutational events in the p53 gene",

    "Title": "Comparison between p53 protein measurements using the luminometric immunoassay and immunohistochemistry with detection of p53 gene mutations using cDNA sequencing in human breast tumors",
    "Abstract": "The p53 mutational status of 226 representative primary breast cancer samples, derived from a population-based cohort, was analyzed using cDNA-based sequencing. The results were compared with those obtained with immunohistochemistry (IHC) on microwave-treated paraffin sections and the p53 specific luminometric immunoassay (LIA) on cytosols, all from the same individuals. Thirty-seven mutations were found using cDNA sequencing and were categorized into A) missense mutations in the evolutionarily conserved regions; B) missense mutations outside the evolutionarily regions; and C) deletions, insertions and nonsense mutations. Using optimal cut-off values, LIA detected 15 of 16 missense mutations in category A, in which IHC detected all 16. In category B, 10 of 13 and 7 of 13 mutations were detected, respectively. Some of the samples in category A had a very high p53 protein content when measured with the LIA, the reason for this being discussed. IHC detected 0 of 5 stop codon and 0 of 3 deletions/insertions mutations, while the LIA method detected 2 of 5 stop codon mutations and 1 of 3 deletion/insertion mutations. Compared with cDNA sequencing, protein analyses using optimal cut-off values resulted in an overall sensitivity and specificity of 64.9% and 89.9%, respectively, for the LIA method. Corresponding values were 72.2% and 92% for IHC. In addition, patients from whom p53 mutations could be detected by cDNA sequencing had a statistically significant (p = 0.0137) shorter survival, which was not readily apparent using the alternative LIA or IHC approaches at optimal cut-off values",

    "Title": "p21/WAF1, p53 and PCNA expression and p53 mutation status in hepatocellular carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/WAF1 is regulated by p5S3- dependent and p53-independent pathways. In addition, p21/WAF1 binds with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and inhibits the action of PCNA. To investigate the possible role of p21/WAF1 in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), we examined the expression of p21/WAF1 and its relation with PCNA and p53 expression in 97 surgically resected HCCs by immunohistochemistry and with the mutation status of p53 in 26 HCCs. p53 mutation status was examined by direct DNA sequencing using 3 sets of primers covering exons 5-9. Six of the 26 tumors showed p53 point mutations and only 33% of these HCCs demonstrated p21/WAF1 expression. In contrast, 75% of HCCs without p53 mutations showed p21/WAF1 expression. Of all 97 HCCs, p21/WAF1 expression was significantly higher in the tumors than in corresponding non-tumorous liver. When the tumors were stratified into 2 groups by the median tumor p21/WAF1 score, those with higher expression were found to have a lower incidence of multiple tumor nodules (p = 0.008) and tumor microsatellite formation (p = 0.050). The tumor p21/WAF1 score was positively associated with tumor PCNA expression (p = 0.036) but not with tumor p53 expression. Thus, in HCC, expression of p21/WAF1 is in part dependent on p53 status, but a p53-independent pathway also plays a significant role in the regulation of p21/WAF1 expression. High p21/WAF1 expression is significantly associated with solitary tumor nodules and, to a lesser extent, tumor microsatellites but may not be enough to suppress tumor progression",

    "Title": "Carcinomas of the renal pelvis associated with smoking and phenacetin abuse: p53 mutations and polymorphism of carcinogen-metabolising enzymes",
    "Abstract": "Phenacetin abuse and smoking are established risk factors for transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary tract. In the present study, we analysed exposure and the clinical course of patients who underwent nephrectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis. PCR-SSCP of archival, paraffin-embedded histological sections followed by direct DNA sequencing revealed that 29 of 89 (33%) renal pelvic carcinomas contained a p53 mutation. Double mutations were found in 4 tumours and triple mutations in 1 tumour. The incidence of p53 mutations was significantly higher in tumours with grades 3 and 4 than in those with grades 1 and 2 and higher in invasive than in non- invasive tumours. Furthermore, patients with carcinomas carrying a p53 mutation showed poorer survival than those without mutation. The type of p53 mutation in renal pelvic carcinomas was similar to that reported for bladder cancer, G:C-->A:T transition mutations being most frequent (45%, 33% of these at CpG sites), followed by G:C-->T:A and G:C-->C:G transversions. The incidence and type of p53 mutation did not differ significantly in patients with a history of phenacetin abuse, smoking or neither of these habits. This was also true for G:C-->T:A transversions (17.5% of mutations), which are considered typical of smoking-induced carcinomas at other sites, e.g., lung, oral cavity and oesophagus. Our results indicate that the frequency and pattern of p53 mutations are similar in transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder and the renal pelvis and do not reflect exposure to phenacetin and/or smoking. The frequency of genetic polymorphism in genes coding for carcinogen-metabolising enzymes (CYP1A1, NAT1, GSTT1 and GSTM1) was also independent of exposure. Although the sample size of our study does not allow definite conclusions, these data are compatible with chronic tissue damage as a causative factor in the evolution of urothelial carcinomas rather than pointing to a direct mutagenic effect of phenacetin and tobacco-specific carcinogens",

    "Abstract": "The P53 gene is frequently mutated in late stage ovarian cancer and has been proposed as a determinant of radiation and chemosensitivity. We have therefore determined the p53 functional status, P53 sequence, radiation sensitivity and cytotoxicity of cisplatin and the novel platinum analogue, AMD473, in a panel of 6 human ovarian cancer cell lines. Constitutive p53 protein levels were low in A2780, CH1, LK1, LK2 and PA1 but were markedly induced following irradiation. In OV1P, constitutive p53 protein was readily detectable and levels were induced slightly following irradiation. p21WAF1/CIP1 and MDM-2 mRNA were constitutively expressed in all the cell lines and expression was induced markedly following irradiation. There was marked radiation induced G1/S arrest in A2780 but only partial arrests in CH1, LK1, LK2, PA1 and OV1P lines. No mutations were found in A2780, CH1, LK1, LK2 and PA1 cells by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis but a heterozygous point mutation was found in exon 5 of OV1P. All the cell lines were radiation sensitive and also relatively sensitive to cisplatin; however, OV1P was the most resistant being consistent with its heterozygous P53 status. AMD473 was less potent than cisplatin but a similar pattern of drug sensitivity was observed with the exception of LK2, which was resistant. CH1, LK1, LK2 and PA1 all expressed BCL-2 protein but there was no expression in A2780 and OV1P. Our results suggest an overall association between wild type P53 and radiation and platinum drug sensitivity in these ovarian cancer cell lines",

    "Abstract": "Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus has an uneven geographic distribution, with a high incidence in the Transkei region of Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The precise molecular events associated with tumorigenesis of esophageal cancer in this region have not been characterized. DNA from human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (n = 76), as well as adjacent tissue samples (n = 9) and blood (n = 50) from the same patients from the Transkei region were screened for somatic mutations. Exons 5-8 of the p53 gene and exons 1-2 of the p16/CDKN2 gene were examined for mutations using PCR-SSCP procedures and DNA sequence analysis. Results show that 17% of the tumors contained small deletions, insertions and point mutations, resulting in frameshifts or amino acid changes in the p53 gene. Among the mutations in the structural p16/CDKN2 gene, 9 were point mutations, 4 were deletions and 3 were insertions. A novel C to T mutation, 25 bp upstream from the ATG start site of p16/CDKN2, which sometimes occurs together with other structural gene variations, was found. The mutations described here are somatic in origin since none of the DNA samples from the adjacent control tissues or blood samples from the same patients had them",

    "Abstract": "We observed a clustering of cholangiocarcinoma in a part of West Virginia. We analyzed the frequency and type of alterations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene and the K-ras oncogene to determine whether cholangiocarcinomas from this high-incidence area differ from other cholangiocarcinomas at the molecular level. We studied 12 carcinomas of patients from the high-incidence area (West Virginia group), and 15 carcinomas of patients from nearby states (non-West Virginia group). Over-expression of the p53 gene product, accompanying most mutations in the p53 gene, was determined by immunohistochemistry. p53 sequence analysis of exons 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the p53-immunohistochemical- positive carcinomas was also performed. K-ras codon 12 mutations were detected by the polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. Significantly more cholangiocarcinomas from the West Virginia group were p53-immunohistochemical-positive than from the non-West Virginia group (67% vs. 20%; p < 0.05). p53 mutations did not differ in the 2 groups in respect to site or specific type. No differences were found between the 2 groups regarding K-ras mutations (17% vs. 27%). Although the higher frequency of p53-immunohistochemical positivity in the West Virginia group may reflect a different etiology of these cholangiocarcinomas, explaining the high incidence in this area, results of p53 sequence analysis were not different in the West Virginia group. The high incidence may be explained by difference in carcinogenic dose or a different etiology not reflected in p53 or K-ras alterations",

    "Title": "Expression of cartilage extracellular matrix and potential regulatory genes in a new human chondrosarcoma cell line",
    "Abstract": "A human chondrosarcoma cell line has been established from an aggressive chondrosarcoma. The cells grow in a monolayer culture (doubling time: 2 days) and form aggregates. The aggregates consist of a rim of cells surrounding a hollow core. The cell line exhibits a unique pattern of mRNA expression with several molecules characteristic of the chondrocyte phenotype. Consistent with the chondrocyte phenotype, mRNAs encoding types IX and XI collagens were present along with an abundant expression of mRNAs encoding the core protein of the cartilage proteoglycans biglycan and aggrecan. No expression of mRNAs encoding types I or II fibrillar collagens or the proteoglycan decorin was observed. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of [35S]sulfate-radiolabeled material confirmed the translation of proteoglycans containing glycosaminoglycan chains. The expression of molecules that contribute to cartilage development and tumorigenesis was examined. The cell line produces abundant mRNA that encodes transforming growth factor-beta1, a member of a family of cartilage and bone inductive proteins. The expression of mRNA encoding two proteins associated specifically with chondrogenesis was detected: Cart-1, a homeobox protein involved in cartilage differentiation, and CD-RAP, a secreted molecule restricted under normal conditions to differentiating chondrocytes and cartilage. Overexpression of p53, a tumor-suppressor gene, was detected. DNA analysis revealed a loss of heterozygosity at the chromosomal locus encoding p53, with the deletion of one p53 allele and the mutation of the remaining allele in both the parent tumor and the cell line. The malignant chondrosarcoma phenotype may be related to the unique gene expression pattern that is characteristic in many ways of differentiating chondroblasts, as well as to the inactivation of the p53 function that could contribute to the proliferative capacity of the cell line. This cell line may serve as a biological model for further investigation of the etiology of human chondrosarcomas and for the synthesis and regulation of cartilage- specific genes",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence and importance of PTEN/MMAC1 mutations in squamous cell carcinomas. METHODS: Exons of each gene were amplified after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic DNA derived from cell lines of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and snap-frozen biopsy specimens from primary established head and neck tumors. The amplified and purified DNA was then sequenced directly. RESULT: As anticipated, point mutations of the p53 gene were found in 80% of cell lines examined. A single base mutation in codon 151 was found in six of 10 cell lines studied. PTEN/MMAC1 gene mutations were found in neither the cell lines tested nor the tumor biopsy samples. CONCLUSION: This study, as well as a large volume of data, confirms that mutations of the p53 gene are frequent events in head and neck cancer cell lines. Although PTEN/MMAC1 gene mutations have been found in a variety of carcinomas, this gene was not found to be mutated in SCCHN cell lines or in primary squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. This information is useful for further studies of mutations in these cell lines",

    "Abstract": "Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), usually confined to the nasopharynx, trachea, and larynx, occasionally can progress to extensive bronchopulmonary disease. Most cases of bronchopulmonary and laryngeal papillomatosis are cytologically benign and do not undergo malignant transformation; however, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can arise in RRP in the absence of known risk factors such as radiation and smoking. In this study, the authors investigated molecular genetic alterations occurring in a case of metastasizing SCC that arose in long- standing bronchopulmonary papillomatosis. Genomic DNA from tracheal papillomata, tracheobronchial papillomata, SCC of the lung, and a lymph node metastasis was extracted. The physical state of the human papillomavirus type 11 (HPV-11) DNA was investigated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Molecular genetic alterations of the host genome were studied by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction- amplified gene fragments and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Episomal and integrated forms of HPV-11 sequences were detected in histologically benign tumors, but only the integrated form of the viral DNA could be found in malignant tissue samples. Molecular genetic studies revealed that an allelic loss of the interferon-beta gene (IFNbeta-1) and an endogenous type of mutation of the p53 antioncogene were found only in the malignant lesions. Mutations were not observed in the ras, neu, or multiple tumor suppressor (MTS1/p16) genes in any specimens. The authors' data indicated that the p53 genetic mutation was associated with integration of HPV-11 in histologically malignant lesions. This association may promote a progressive genetic instability that can lead to the development and clonal expansion of malignant lesions in RRP",

The genetic alterations analyzed were: deletion of CDKN2a/p16 gene, TP53 mutations, and amplification of EGFR, MDM2 and CDK4. The most common genetic alteration was EGFR amplification which was revealed in 15 cases (45%). TP53 mutation was identified in 9 cases (27%) and CDKN2/p16 deletion was detected in 13 cases (41%). Either MDM2 and CDK4 amplifications were less frequent, as they were identified in 4 (12%) and 1 (3%) case, respectively. Of the 15 cases showing the amplification of EGFR, 9 had CDKN2/p16 deletion (60%, p = 0.04). On the other hand, CDKN2/p16 deletion and EGFR amplification rarely occurred with TP53 mutations (2 of 14 cases with CDKN2/p16 deletion, 14%).

Two genetic alterations have been identified: the first one is a GGC --> GAT (Gly -- > Asp, Asp13p21) mutation at codon 13 in the Ki-ras gene, found in five out of six tumors. The second one is an AT --> TA transversion in the p53 gene resulting in missense mutations at different codons and was found in three out of six tumors. By analysing both the tumors and sera from the same patients, we have shown that the Asp13p21 and mutant p53 proteins could be detected reliably in the serum. We thereafter analysed 225 serum samples, selected from a cohort of about 900 VC- exposed workers, for the presence of the two mutant proteins and p53 antibodies. A statistical analysis supports a strong dose-response relationship between the serum markers positivity and the VC-exposure. A follow-up of this cohort should now allow us to assert the predictive value of these markers",

    "Title": "Analysis of p53 gene mutations in keloids using polymerase chain reaction-based single-strand conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing [see comments]",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Keloids are the result of a dysregulated wound healing process. They are characterized by the formation of excess scar tissue that proliferates beyond the boundaries of the original wound. Somatic mutations of p53 have been implicated as causal events in up to 50% of all human malignancies. In addition, p53 has been shown to play an important role in controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis. We hypothesize that mutations in p53 can lead to a hyperproliferative state that can result in keloid formation. OBJECTIVE: To detect p53 DNA mutations in tissues and cultured fibroblasts from skin lesions of 7 patients with keloids. DESIGN: The polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing were used to detect p53 gene mutations. SETTING: The Department of Dermatology, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Mich. PATIENTS: Seven patients with keloids seen for routine surgical excision of their lesions. Normal DNA specimens were obtained from buccal smears and healthy skin samples from these patients. RESULTS: Mutations in the p53 were identified in all patients by polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and subsequently confirmed by DNA sequencing. A mutation in exon 5 resulting in amino acid substitution was found in 1 of the patients in keloid tissue and cultured keloid fibroblasts (codon 156, CGC-->CCC, arginine-->proline). Frameshift mutations in exons 5 and 6 caused by the insertion or deletion of a nucleotide at different positions were found in 6 patients with keloids in both keloid tissues and cultured fibroblasts. Mutations in exon 4 resulting in amino acid substitution were found in all patients in both keloid tissues and cultured fibroblasts (all in codon 72, CGC-->CCC, arginine-->proline). No p53 mutations were detected in buccal smears or cultured fibroblasts from healthy skin samples of any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Focal mutations in p53 may increase cell proliferation and decrease cell death in the dysregulated growth patterns that have been clinically documented. An understanding of the pattern of all growth dysregulation related to keloids may lead to new therapeutic strategies",

However, patients sometimes develop lymph node recurrences in spite of having no lymph node metastases found by conventional histopathologic examination. In a patient with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, we sequenced all the p53 cDNA translated regions (exon 2-10) of primary carcinoma, and confirmed one p53 nonsense mutation in exon 10. Then we extracted genomic DNA from 150 surgically dissected lymph nodes from that patient, and performed polymerase chain reaction analysis (PCR-RFLP) to detect the same p53 mutation in the lymph nodes. PCR-RFLP analysis showed the same p53 mutation in six lymph nodes. One node was located along the right recurrent laryngeal nerve, where no positive nodes was identified by conventional histopathologic examination. The p53 mutational diagnosis of metastatic cancer may be useful in detecting minimal residual disease",

    "Title": "p53 mutations and presence of HPV DNA do not correlate with radiosensitivity of gynecological cancer cell lines",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The correlation between p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations and the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA with the in vitro radiosensitivity of gynecological malignancies was studied in 26 cell lines derived from gynecological cancers of 23 patients. METHODS: Comparison of the intrinsic radiosensitivity was performed with mean inactivation dose (D) determined with the 96-well plate clonogenic assay. p53 mutations were investigated with polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and direct DNA sequencing, and the presence of HPV DNA was studied with PCR using HPV consensus primers. RESULTS: p53 mutations were found in 6 of 10 vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lines. Nine vulvar and 1 vaginal SCC cell lines were HPV DNA negative and 1 vulvar cell line was HPV 16 positive. All 4 cervical SCC lines were HPV positive and possessed the wild-type p53. Three cell lines expressed HPV 16 and 1 HPV 68. Among 10 endometrial cancer cell lines, 2 cell lines with mutant p53 and 1 HPV 16 positive cell line were found. No correlation could be demonstrated between inactivation of the p53 gene and radiosensitivity in vitro; the cell lines were evaluated as one group or according to their anatomical origin or histology. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that inactivation of the p53 gene through mutation or binding with HPV DNA does not increase the resistance of gynecological malignancies to ionizing radiation in vitro.

    "Abstract": "We examined p53 protein expression, p53 gene mutation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and argyrophilic nuclear organizer regions (AgNOR), in 30 patients with surgically-treated thymic tumors (26 thymoma and 4 thymic carcinoma cases). p53 expression ratio with DO-1 was divided as p53 negative (0% positivity), low expressor (<10% positivity), high expressor (>10% positivity). The incidence of p53 low and high expressor in thymoma were 19% (5/26) and 8% (2/26), respectively. p53 immunopositivity in thymoma was significantly correlated with PCNA labeling index (LI). p53 expression ratio in invasive thymoma (33%) tended to be higher than that in non-invasive thymoma (18%). p53 expression was detected in one of the thymic carcinoma. There were no p53 gene mutations in 15 invasive thymoma, although one of four (25%) thymic carcinomas showed two point mutations. p53 gene alterations seem to be associated with malignant activity of tumor cells, and therefore detection of p53 gene mutations is useful as a diagnostic factor",

    "Title": "Determination of p53 protein and high-risk human papillomavirus DNA in carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter",
    "Abstract": "The presence and distribution of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA type-16 and -18 or overexpression of the p53 protein were determined in 31 patients with renal pelvic and ureteral carcinoma in Saga prefecture of Japan, consisting of 28 transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) and 3 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). In situ hybridization with DNA probes for HPV-16 and -18 was performed as well as immunohistochemical techniques using antibody to p53 protein. Fresh tumor tissues from 8 patients were also studied for p53 mutations in exons 5 through 8 by direct sequencing. Of 28 TCC patients at Saga prefecture in Japan, 10 tested were positive for HPV DNA, 5 for HPV type-16, 4 for HPV type-18 and one doubly-positive case. Of the remaining 18 tumors, seven showed positive nuclear staining in cancer cells with p53 antibody. One of the 3 patients with SCCs also revealed the nuclear positivity of the cancer cells with p53 antibody but not with HPV infection. p53 point mutation was detected in 2 cases also showing p53 immunopositivity. Overexpressed p53 protein was statistically more common in invasive and non-papillary (p<0.05) and in high-grade TCCs (p<0.05). These findings suggest that HPV infection, and expression (mutation) of p53 protein may be intimately related to the pathogenesis of urothelial tumor cell growth and progression",

    "Title": "Mutations of p53 gene can be detected in the plasma of patients with large bowel carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "AIMS: To attempt to detect p53 gene mutations in the plasma of patients with large bowel carcinoma. METHODS: Plasma was collected from 20 control patients with no history of cancer and from 17 patients with large bowel carcinoma. Corresponding tumour and benign lymph node (control) samples for each of the carcinoma patients were obtained from paraffin blocks. A Dukes' stage was determined for each tumour. DNA was extracted from the plasma samples and the paraffin embedded tissue using previously described methods. A nested primer polymerase chain reaction protocol was used for the amplification of exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene. 'Cold' single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) was performed on mini gels and silver stained. Abnormal bands were excised, the DNA eluted, and reamplified for automated dye termination sequencing. Any sample showing an apparent mutation was rechecked from the original extracted DNA sample at least three times. RESULTS: p53 gene mutations were not found in the control specimens. They were found in both the primary tumour and the plasma in three cases, in the primary tumour alone in one case, and in the plasma alone in two cases. One of the latter two cases also had metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and the other had widespread metastatic deposits. One of the cases with mutant DNA in both the plasma and the primary was a Dukes' stage B tumour. The others were Dukes' C and Dukes' D. CONCLUSIONS: p53 gene mutations can be detected in the plasma of some patients with large bowel carcinoma and these are concordant with those in the primary carcinomas",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been used as molecular genetic markers of disease and serve as a prognostic indicator in various malignancies including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Alterations in the p53 gene were investigated in a bone marrow sample from a NHL patient admitted for autologous bone marrow transplantation. Diffuse mixed small and large cell NHL, was initially diagnosed which eventually progressed to large cell lymphoma at relapse following poly- chemotherapy. A sequential technique of polymerase chain reaction- mediated single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) of the p53 gene revealed a shift in one band of exon 6 in the bone marrow, collected at the time of initial diagnosis. No mutations were detected in exons 5, 7, 8 and 9. Direct sequencing of exon 6 detected a single base change from G to C resulting in an amino acid substitution from glycine to histidine. Results of this study and data reviewed from other publications suggest that the missense p53 mutation seen in this patient at the time of diagnosis may perhaps have been used to predict the eventual outcome of the disease. This could, therefore, serve as an important genetic disease marker particularly in bone marrow or peripheral blood samples initially collected and cryopreserved for future possible autologous transplantation",

    "Title": "p53 mutation in a case of blastic transformation of follicular lymphoma with double bcl-2 rearrangement (MBR and VCR)",
    "Abstract": "The bcl-2 gene is rearranged in most cases of follicular lymphoma and the breakpoint clusters are found in two specific regions: mbr and mcr. Rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgH) result in a deregulation of the gene and increased transcription of mRNA for the bcl-2 protein. In cases of rearrangement of the light chains (variant translocations), a third breakpoint has been described at the 5' part of the bcl-2 locus (vcr). In the present case, we report the molecular analysis of an FL transformed into a blastic phase unresponsive to chemotherapy. Molecular studies revealed a typical bcl-2 rearrangement at the major locus (mbr). Vcr rearrangements was also observed with only a single restriction enzyme. At the same time, SSCP analysis of exon 5 of the p53 locus disclosed an abnormal conformer. Direct sequencing revealed a point mutation at codon 163 (A --> G). Immunohistochemical analysis of the affected sites disclosed overexpression of p53 and bcl-2. It is concluded that p53 mutation can contribute to blastic transformation in cases of follicular lymphomas with double rearrangement at the bcl-2 locus (mbr/vcr)",

    "Title": "Sebaceous carcinoma. Tumor progression through mutational inactivation of p53",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sebaceous carcinoma may masquerade for years as an inflammatory condition. In many cases, this may be because of the presence of longstanding intraepithelial disease (e.g., dysplasia or carcinoma in situ), which eventually progresses to invasive carcinoma recognized through tumefaction and a worsening clinical presentation. The mechanism for this tumor progression is unknown. In the Far East, human papilloma virus (HPV) has been suggested to play a role in the development of sebaceous carcinoma by inactivating tumor suppressor gene p53. Here, the authors explore the molecular basis of the progression of ocular sebaceous carcinoma. METHODS: Cases of sebaceous carcinoma seen at the University of Virginia, Department of Ophthalmology, during the period from 1989 to 1996 were analyzed for HPV infection by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. The expression of p53, p21WAF-1, Bcl-2, and epithelial membrane antigen was examined by immunohistochemistry. In one of the cases, frozen tumor was available, allowing exons 5 through 9 of the p53 gene to be sequenced. RESULTS: Seven cases were identified, all of which were from women. All were negative for HPV. In cases in which disease was restricted to dysplasia (carcinoma in situ), p53 but not p21WAF-1 was negative. In contrast, cases that contained a component of invasive or metastatic carcinoma showed striking hyperexpression of nuclear p53 in all of the malignant cells. In one of these cases, a G:C-->T:A transversion was found in the p53 gene. This mutation, characteristic of bulky carcinogens, substituted phenylalanine for cysteine 277, a residue that participates in hydrogen bonding to the p53 DNA binding consensus sequence. CONCLUSIONS: Mutational inactivation of p53 may be involved in the progression of sebaceous carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Although it is well known that oncogenesis is a multistep process involving the activation of normal cellular genes to become oncogenes and/or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, this process has seldom been investigated in soft tissue tumours. We screened a group of 36 liposarcomas for genetic abnormalities in the p53 tumour suppressor gene and c-myc oncogene. Altered c-myc gene expression was examined by differential RT-PCR assay. p53 Gene mutations in exons 4-8 were analysed by using PCR-SSCP analysis and direct sequencing. Elevated c- myc expression was found in 6 of 31 liposarcomas (19.4%). p53 Gene mutations were observed in 5 of 36 liposarcomas (13.9%). Both genetic alterations were associated with the histological subtype of liposarcomas. Whereas c-myc gene expression was a characteristic of myxoid/round cell liposarcomas, p53 gene mutations were found more frequently in pleomorphic variants. Liposarcomas of the well- differentiated subtype showed neither p53 gene mutations nor altered c- myc gene expression. Our results indicate that the c-myc oncogene and the p53 tumor suppressor gene do not seem to cooperate in the oncogenesis of liposarcomas",

    "Abstract": "In hepatocarcinogenesis, both de novo and multistep pathways have been suggested and in the latter a dysplastic nodule is the proposed precancerous lesion. In this study, we tried to ascertain whether or not the p53 gene is altered in low-grade/high-grade dysplastic nodules (LDN/HDN) and to determine the role of p53 alteration in multistep hepatocarcinogenesis. Eight hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), 9 HDNs, 17 LDNs and 25 cirrhotic nodules (LCs) were examined by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism/direct sequencing and immunohistochemical staining for p53. Four of the 8 HCCs (50%) revealed p53 overexpression and 2 (25%) had missense mutations. Four of the 9 HDNs (44%) showed weak and/or focal p53 overexpression but none had mutation in the exons examined. Neither p53 overexpression nor mutation was found in 17 LDNs and 25 LCs. These results suggest that p53 mutation might be an unusual event in precancerous lesions of multistep hepatocarcinogenesis (DN-HCC sequence) and may play a less crucial part than in colorectal carcinogenesis",

    "Abstract": "Fibrosarcomatous (FS) change in a rare, but well-known phenomenon encountered in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), and an increased chance in an adverse outcome has been suggested in patients with DFSP having FS areas (DFSP-FS). As altered p53 pathway has been suggested as having a potential role in tumour progression, we analysed the p53 gene and p53 protein together with the p53-related protein mdm2 and p21Waf1 in 5 cases of DFSP-FS and 13 of DFSP to ascertain whether the p53 pathway correlates to the fibrosarcomatous transformation of DFSP. Three of the five DFSP-FSs overexpressed p53 protein immunohistochemically, and one of them had a 'missense' mutation of the p53 gene without immunohistochemical overexpression of mdm2 or p21Waf1. The other two DFSP-FSs with p53 overexpression demonstrated increased labelling indices of both mdm2 and p21Waf1. The three DFSP-FS patients with overexpression of p53 protein had frequent local recurrences, ranging from 3 to 5 in number with increasingly short intervals (mean 4.5 years), while one of the other two had no recurrences and the other, only one. None of the 13 DFSPs showed any alterations in the p53 gene or overexpressions of p53, mdm2 and p21Waf1, except for one DFSP having a 'silent' mutation of the p53 gene. Three DFSPs had local recurrences once or twice with longer intervals to recurrence (mean 10.3 years). Although the number of cases examined is limited, the results suggest that alterations in the p53 pathway, such as overexpression of p53 protein by a mutated gene and mdm2 overexpression, are involved in fibrosarcomatous transformation in a subset of fibrohistiocytic tumours and possibly correlated with its more locally aggressive behaviour than that without p53 alterations or ordinary DFSP",

In 24 adult patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the status of the p53 gene at different stages was serially followed by cytogenetic and polymerase-chain reaction/single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) analysis. P53 mutation was detected in 6 patients (25%) and all were at relapsed stages: 3 at first relapse, 2 at second relapse and one at refractory phase. Loss of the remaining p53 allele was demonstrated in 5 of them by cytogenetic and SSCP analysis. Furthermore, all of the p53 mutations were associated with appearance of complex cytogenetic changes (CCG), suggesting of cytogenetic instability (CGI). The frequency of acquiring p53 mutation during leukemic progression is significantly higher in patients with CGI than in patients without CGI (6/11 v 0/13, p = 0.003). P53 mutation was detected either concurrently (n = 2) or after (n = 4, 2(+)-18 months) appearance of CCG. The results suggest that p53 mutation is frequently involved during ALL relapse and is closely linked with cytogenetic instability",

To determine the correlation of protein detection by immunohistochemistry and gene mutation, paraffin embedded specimens of 60 oral leukoplakias (OL) and 73 oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) were analysed by IHC with two different antibodies (Do7; Pab 1801), PCR- SSCP and sequencing. In 98% of OLs and 94% of OSSCs p53 protein expression was detected with at least one antibody. Only 49% of all tissue specimen were positive with both antibodies. Molecular analysis of the same specimen showed mutations of the p53 gene in 13.3% of OLs and 9, 6% of OSCCs. p53 protein expression was not detected by IHC in 3 out of 7 OSCC with p53 mutations. According to these results detection of p53 expression by IHC is not always correlated with p53 gene mutation and failure to detect p53 protein by IHC does not prove the absence of mutation of the gene in the carcinogenesis in the oral mucosa",

DNA was extracted from fifty-five blocks and exons 5 to 9 of the p53 gene were amplified with nested primers, thereafter sequencing was performed to confirm the presence of mutations detected by single stranded conformational polymorphism. RESULTS: Fifty-six cases (51%) showed p53 expression, while fourteen mutations (25%) were detected. A significant difference was found between the PCNA index in p53 positive and p53 negative tumors while the mean PCNA index for the tumors with p53 mutations was not significantly different from the tumors without mutations.

    "Title": "Implications of p53 mutation spectrum for cancer etiology in gastric cancers of various histologic types from a high-risk area of central Italy",
    "Abstract": "Examination of p53 mutation spectra may provide clues to molecular mechanisms involved in different histologic types of gastric cancer. A total of 105 gastric cancer cases classified according to the Lauren's system were selected from a high-risk area around Florence, Italy. Exons 5-8 of the p53 gene were examined for mutations by the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism technique and DNA sequencing, using DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Mutation frequency was similar in intestinal-type (12/28) and unclassified tumors (9/18), but was significantly lower in diffuse cancers (12/57, P < 0.05). A similar frequency of p53 mutations was observed among tumor stages in both intestinal-type and unclassified cancers, but in diffuse tumors mutations tended to be associated with invasion beyond the muscularis propria. When base changes were considered, G:C-->A:T transitions at CpG sites were the most common mutations for all the three tumor types with 6 of 11 (55%) in intestinal type, 8 of 12 (67%) in diffuse type, and 5 of 8 (63 %) in unclassified tumors. Frequent p53 mutations in both intestinal-type and unclassified tumors support the hypothesis that unclassified tumors represent variants of the intestinal type and suggest that unclassified tumors, like the intestinal type, may also associate with environmental exposures. The predominance of G:C-->A:T transitions at CpG sites, which are associated with methyltransferase-induced DNA methylation at carbon 5 of cytosine, in all three tumor types suggests that the status of DNA methylation may be the major determinant for p53 mutations and may be also equally important in gastric carcinogenesis regardless of histology",

    "Abstract": "In a consecutive series of 222 colorectal carcinomas from patients with a median follow-up time of 56.8 months (range, 0.5-92.2) treated with surgery, the TP53 gene was screened for mutations. Exons 5-8 were analyzed using constant denaturant gel electrophoresis followed by sequencing, and mutations were found in 102 cases (45.9%). Mutations were found more frequently in rectal tumors versus other locations (P = 0.029) and in aneuploid compared to diploid tumors (P < 0.001). Presence of a TP53 mutation was also significantly associated with absence of microsatellite instability (P = 0.028), as well as with loss of heterozygosity at 17p13 (P < 0.001). The TP53 mutations in the left- sided and rectal tumors were more often transversions than transitions, indicating a different etiology in the development of these tumors. The tendency for shorter cancer-related survival among patients with mutations in their tumors was only statistically significant for patients with left-sided tumors (P = 0.003). All patients with mutations affecting the L3 domain of the protein involved in zinc binding had a significantly shorter cancer-related survival (P = 0.036), indicating that mutations affecting this domain have biological relevance in terms of colorectal cancer disease course. These results suggest that knowledge of a patient's TP53 status, with respect to both the presence and the localization of the mutation, may be important in prognosis evaluation, particularly when selecting patients for more aggressive postoperative therapeutic intervention",

    "Title": "p53 point mutations and thymidylate synthase messenger RNA levels in disseminated colorectal cancer: an analysis of response and survival",
    "Abstract": "Recent studies suggest that there may be a strong correlation between the p53 status of a tumor and a patient's response to chemotherapy. Therefore, we determined p53 status in 36 patients with disseminated colorectal cancer by cDNA sequencing and immunohistochemical staining, as well as by the gene expression level of thymidylate synthase (TS), the target enzyme of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), by reverse transcription- PCR. Ten patients (28%) experienced a clinical response to 5-FU chemotherapy. Overall, TS expression and response to chemotherapy were associated: 9 of 18 (50%) patients with TS < or = 3.0 x 10(-3) responded, compared to 1 of 18 (6%) patients with TS > 3.0 x 10(-3) (P = 0.003). p53 mutations were found in 21 of 36 patients (58%) using cDNA cycle sequencing, and p53 protein overexpression was found in 20 of 32 patients (62%) using immunohistochemistry staining. Overall p53 status and response to chemotherapy were associated: 5 of 10 (50%) patients with wild-type p53 or negative p53 staining experienced a response, but only 5 of 26 (19%) patients with mutant p53 or p53 overexpression responded. TS expression, but not expression of p53, was significantly associated with overall survival (P = 0.002). Patients with wild-type p53 had significantly lower TS levels compared to patients with mutated p53 (P = 0.044). In this study, we also present data linking specific p53 point mutations to TS expression levels and resistance to 5-FU. Although the number of patients is relatively small, these results identify p53 status and TS gene expression as associated with response in disseminated colorectal cancer; independent studies are needed to confirm these findings and to provide information leading to a better understanding of the role of 5-FU-based chemotherapy in the treatment of colorectal cancer",

    "Title": "Frequent detection of ras and p53 mutations in brush cytology samples from lung cancer patients by a restriction fragment length polymorphism- based 'enriched PCR' technique",
    "Abstract": "RFLP-mediated PCR has been successfully applied as a reliable tool in the detection of ras mutations in many cancers and provides a basis for 'mutant-enriched PCR' protocols. We have, therefore, modified this technique to the sensitive detection of K-ras codon 12 and also p53 'hot spot' mutations, which, frequently in lung cancer, affect codons at the positions 157, 175, 245, 248, 249, and 273. With a high sensitivity of 1 mutant allele in 10(4) normal alleles, our enrichment assay allows the detection of oncogene alleles when only a few tumor cells are present within a normal cell population. Brush cytology material obtained from the tumor site of 20 patients with endoscopically apparent bronchial carcinoma was compared to macroscopically normal mucosa taken from the contralateral bronchus ('control' cytology). We found K-ras codon 12 mutations in 5 cases (25%) and p53 mutations in 13 cases (65%) in the tumor-derived cell material but, with the exception of two cases, not in cell material taken from the control cytology. Seventy-five % of the samples analyzed showed that at least one of the two oncogenes was affected. In several cases, two p53 lesions were detected concomitantly. The majority of the mutations could be reconfirmed by an alternative approach exploiting changes in the genomic RFLP pattern induced by these mutations and were also demonstrated in separate diagnostic biopsies taken. Thus, we conclude that the established enriched PCR protocol ensures a high sensitivity and preserved specificity for the diagnosis of oncogene lesions associated with lung cancer. Because conventional techniques normally yield a lower incidence of corresponding ras and p53 mutations, we think that both the high rate and the heterogeneity of p53 mutations found in some cases are, indeed, related to the increased sensitivity of this new enriched PCR technique",

    "Title": "Comparison of features of human breast cancer cell lines and their corresponding tumors",
    "Abstract": "Although human tumor-derived cell lines play an important role in the investigation of cancer biology and genetics, there is no comprehensive study comparing tumor cell line properties with those of the individual tumors from which they were derived. We compared the properties of a series of 18 human breast cancer cell lines that were cultured for a median period of 25 months (range, 9-60 months) and their corresponding archival tumor tissues. We compared morphological characteristics, ploidy, and immunohistochemical expression of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2/neu and p53 proteins. For 17 of these cases, we also tested for allelic losses at 18 chromosomal regions frequently deleted in breast tumors using 51 polymorphic microsatellite markers, and we determined the TP53 gene mutation status in exons 5 to 10. There was an excellent correlation between the breast tumor cell lines and their corresponding tumor tissues for morphological features (100%); presence of aneuploidy (87%); immunohistochemical expression of estrogen receptors (87%), progesterone receptors (73%), and HER2/neu (93%) and p53 proteins (100%); allelic loss at all of the chromosomal regions analyzed (82-100% concordance); and TP53 gene mutations (75%). The same parental allele was lost in 279 (99%) of 281 of the comparisons of allelic losses. The fractional allelic loss indices (a reflection of the total allelic loss) of the cell lines and their corresponding tumor tissues were identical or similar in 15 (88%) of 17 paired comparisons. Although our previous studies (A. Gazdar et al., Int. J. Cancer, in press) indicated that only a subset of primary breast carcinomas that have several features indicative of advanced tumors with poor prognosis can be successfully cultured, the cell lines retain the properties of their parental tumors for lengthy culture periods and, thus, provide suitable model systems for biomedical studies",

    "Abstract": "We have amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) a 2.0 kbp region of the p53 gene containing exons 5--9 from seven cell lines reported in the literature to contain the majority of mutations reported for this gene. Sequence analysis of these products show that all seven cell lines contain mutations within the mutational hot spots of the p53 gene. Six of the seven clones have single base substitutions and the seventh has a single base deletion. We have analyzed the seven p53 single point mutations by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis using fluorescence slab gel electrophoresis (SG-SSCP). Fluorescent-labeled PCR primers were used for amplification of specific exons for mutation detection. SG-SSCP was conducted using Model 373 and Model 377 DNA sequencers with GeneScan Software (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystem Division). Nine different gel systems were first tested for their ability to resolve the p53 mutations using the Model 373 instrument. Two gel systems were capable of resolving all of the mutations that were screened. Optimal results were obtained with 12% w/v acrylamide 50:1 plus 10% v/v glycerol. This gel system was used to evaluate the effect of temperature on the ability to resolve the mutations. The separation with respect to wild type varied for each mutation examined. Subambient temperature (20 degrees C) was preferable overall for discrimination of these mutations as a group. We intend to use this system to examine a much larger panel of p53 mutation standards that are now under development",

    "Title": "Comparative analysis of p53 mutations in bladder washings and histologic specimens",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53, analyzed in bladder washings, have positive predictive value for the progression of superficial bladder cancer to invasive disease. Bladder washings reflect the general status of the urothelium, and because sampling of bladder washings can be performed as an outpatient procedure, patients can be monitored more carefully. To determine the actual value of bladder washing specimens in assessing the p53 status of histologic specimens, we used the technique of polymerase chain reaction-single- strand conformation polymorphism to analyze bladder washings and the synchronous tumors of 15 patients for the presence of p53 mutations. A significant correlation (2-tailed Fisher's exact test) between the p53 status of bladder washings and histologic specimens was observed if the 2 were compared among the specimens of a single patient. Overall, in 2 patients the mutation present in the tumors was not detected in the bladder washings, and in 1 patient the mutation in the bladder washing was not detected in the histologic specimens. These conflicting results obtained with bladder washings and histologic specimens could be explained mainly by the architecture of the tumors. The observed specificity of 86% and sensitivity of 75% emphasizes that although the correlation between the 2 methods is good, in a number of cases they are complementary to each other. The analysis of p53 mutations in at least 2 bladder washings gives insight into the p53 status of the synchronous tumors",

    "Title": "p53 mutations and DNA ploidy in colorectal adenocarcinomas",
    "Abstract": "The p53 tumour suppressor gene has an important role in the the maintenance of genome stability and its mutational inactivation may be at the origin of aneuploidy in cancer cells. The aim of this study was to determine whether p53 mutations were associated to DNA aneuploidy, as assessed by flow cytometry, in colorectal adenocarcinomas. Analysis of p53 mutations spectrum of the sorted nuclei was done by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and DNA sequencing. Overall, we studied 20 adenocarcinomas, the corresponding control mucosa, and 7 lymph node metastases. Five tumours (25%) were DNA diploid, while 15 tumours (75%) were composed of DNA aneuploid and diploid subpopulations. DNA diploid control mucosa and adenocarcinomas showed no p53 mutations, while 60% of the tumours with DNA aneuploidy had p53 mutations. Therefore, p53 mutations occurred significantly more often in DNA aneuploid than in DNA diploid tumours (p < 0.04, Fisher's exact test). Incidences of DNA aneuploidy and p53 mutations in lymph node metastases were 60 and 86%, respectively. In all tumours showing a p53 mutation, the wild-type allele was not or only bearly visible in DNA aneuploid cells suggesting that, in such cells, aneuploidy is accompanied by complete p53 functional inactivation. The present observations suggest that p53 mutations may have a role in the origin of aneuploidy at late stages of colorectal carcinogenesis",

In the present study we have analysed the expression of the p53 tumour suppressor gene in the synovial pannus tissue from patients at various stages of the disease. We used a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) on DNA and reverse transcription, PCR and sequencing on cDNAs from synovial tissues or purified synovial cell populations of 24 RA and three osteoarthritis (OA) patients. We also studied p53 expression by immunohistochemical analysis. Mutations suspected after SSCP were identified by systematic sequencing of the p53 exon 6, especially in the fibroblast-like, adherent synovial cell population, associated with an erosive disease. Some accumulation of the protein was detected in immunohistochemical analysis of the p53 tumour suppressor gene in the patients' synovial tissues. However, no sign of malignancy was seen in these patients after a 2-year survey. These results show some abnormalities in the p53 tumour suppressor gene in RA patients, but do not allow this to be related to characteristic proliferative features of the rheumatoid synovium",

We evaluated 48 chondrosarcomas for p53 overexpression and p53 mutations. p53 expression was evaluated with immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies PAb421, PAb1801, and PAb240. p53 mutations were identified with single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing in selected cases. Immunohistochemistry revealed nuclear staining with PAb421 and PAb1801 in the spindle cell portion of one dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. SSCP analysis was abnormal only in the case with positive immunostaining and localized the mutation to exons 7 and 8. DNA sequence analysis identified a point mutation of G to C in codon 276, resulting in an amino acid substitution of proline for alanine. This point mutation has been reported previously in other tumors but not in chondrosarcoma. Assimilation of our results with previous studies suggests that p53 mutations are present in a minority of chondrosarcomas but when present, are in higher grade chondrosarcomas and their variants",

    "Title": "Molecular analysis of the p53 gene in pancreatic adenocarcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most common genetic alterations found in human cancer. Most mutations are accompanied by stabilization of the protein, which renders the mutations detectable through immunohistochemical techniques. The immunoreactivity of p53, however, might not correlate with the result of p53 DNA sequencing. In order to explain the discrepancy, we studied the p53 expressions, mutations, and changes of the three-dimensional protein structure of mutant p53 in a series of 61 pancreatic adenocarcinoma specimens using immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), DNA sequencing, and computerized protein modeling. PCR-SSCP followed by DNA sequencing of the p53 gene showed mutations in 31.2% (19 of 61) of the pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Eight of 19 cases showed p53 immunopositivity. These mutations were located on the surface of the three-dimensional structure or formed unfolded proteins, which were easily recognized by the antibody. Among other mutations in which p53 was immunonegative, five cases with deletions and insertion caused frameshift and formation of severely truncated p53 protein structures unreactive with the antibody used. In three cases with point mutations, the mutant amino acids were located in the core of the tightly packed beta sandwich inaccessible to the antibody. Three silent mutations were immunonegative, corresponding with the absence of amino acid changes. These results strongly suggest that the analysis of a computer-generated p53 three-dimensional model based on DNA sequencing data can assist in evaluating the significance of p53 immunostaining and mutations for clinical applications",

To understand the roles of these genes in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) tumorigenesis, we examined whether BAX mutations occur in adenoma and carcinoma specimens from patients with HNPCC and also determined the frequencies of p53 mutations. METHODS: Thirteen colorectal adenomas and 24 adenocarcinomas from patients with HNPCC showing a microsatellite instability phenotype were screened by polymerase chain reaction followed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing. RESULTS: Two of the 13 adenomas (15.4%) and 13 of the 24 adenocarcinomas (54.2%) showed mutation patterns and were confirmed to have frame-shift mutations at the BAX repeat site by direct sequencing. For p53, only 1 of the 24 adenocarcinomas (4.2%) showed a missense mutation. CONCLUSIONS: In HNPCC colorectal carcinomas, BAX was significantly (P = 0.024) more mutated than in adenomas. p53 was not frequently found to be mutated in these carcinomas. These data suggest that mutations in BAX, rather than mutations in p53, may contribute to the adenoma- carcinoma transition in HNPCC tumorigenesis",

To better study neoplastic evolution in Barrett's esophagus, the aim of this study was to establish in vitro cultures from preneoplastic tissues. METHODS: Mechanical and enzymatic dissociation methods were used to initiate Barrett's epithelial cultures from endoscopic biopsy specimens, and the cells were characterized using flow-cytometric, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic analyses. RESULTS: Four long-term cultures were established from 39 attempts. All cultures contain cytogenetic abnormalities and elevated flow-cytometric 4N DNA content fractions. Molecular genetic abnormalities detected include the following: 9p and/or CDKN2/p16 abnormalities in 4 of 4 cultures, 17p loss of heterozygosity and p53 mutation in 3 of 4 cultures, and 5q loss of heterozygosity in 1 of 4 cultures. Inactivation of p53 was statistically associated with successful long-term culture. CONCLUSIONS: These cultures contain cell cycle and molecular genetic abnormalities that closely parallel those previously documented to occur early in cancer development in Barrett's esophagus in vivo. These alterations also appear to be associated with successful growth in vitro. The cultures may provide a premalignant in vitro system in which to test potential therapies for Barrett's esophagus as well as to examine etiologic factors and genetic intermediates important in neoplastic progression",

    "Abstract": "A patient with ulcerative colitis, extensive dysplasia, multifocal colon cancer, and an appendiceal cystadenoma is described. A 48-year- old man with a 26-year history of ulcerative colitis (UC) had extensive dysplasia involving nearly the entire colon and four dysplasia- associated mass lesions (DALMs). Four invasive adenocarcinomas were present. This case is the first documentation of a DALM (mucinous cystadenoma) arising in the appendix in the setting of UC. The genetic alterations present in the various lesions were analyzed. The molecular profiles of the neoplastic lesions differed. Mutations were found in p53 and ras genes, and one site showed microsatellite instability in a single genetic locus. These molecular abnormalities develop before invasive cancer develops, and may undergo clonal expansion to create large mucosal patches containing certain cells with genetic alterations. The diversity of the early changes suggests that the recurrent inflammation characteristic of long-standing UC randomly damages genes known to participate in colon carcinogenesis and that it affects multiple target genes. The findings also support a multiclonal origin of synchronous tumors because the molecular phenotypes of the preinvasive lesions differed at various sites",

Six colorectal cancers in this study showed heterogeneity in p53 mutations in cells from the intramucosal part. In the invasive part of a carcinoma, p53 mutation status was homogeneous intratumorally in all cases.

We investigated this question within individual esophageal cancers, and also in their lymph-node metastases in 8 cases. Analyzing the p53 gene sequence by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products, we found heterogeneity for p53 mutations in the pre-invasive area in 3 esophageal cancers. In all areas sampled in the invasive portion of each cancer, the p53 mutational status was identical in a given tumor. In heterogeneous tumors, the invasive area showed one of the p53 mutations found in the pre-invasive area. In nodal metastases, the p53 mutation was identical to that in the invasive area of each primary tumor. These data suggest that the timing of p53 alteration is not as early as might have been expected, indicating that, in regard to p53 gene alteration, some esophageal cancers are composed of various subclones in the pre-invasive stage with invasiveness developing in one of them, which becomes predominant through clonal selection",

    "Abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) and its derivatives can directly cause DNA damage and mutation in vitro and may play a role in the multistage carcinogenic process. It has been reported that NO induces mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene; we therefore analyzed the relationship between NO synthase (NOS) activity and p53 gene status in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma. Surgical samples were classified into two categories: 14 lung adenocarcinomas with high NOS activity (>25 pmol/min/g tissue, category A), and 16 with low NOS activity (<25 pmol/min/g tissue, category B). A yeast functional assay for p53 mutations disclosed a red colony that corresponded to a mutation in the p53 gene in 8 cases (57.1%) in category A and 3 cases (18.8%) in category B, the frequency being significantly higher in the former (P<0.05). A p53 DNA sequence analysis revealed that 5 of the 8 p53 mutation-positive samples in category A had a G:C-to-T:A transversion, which is reported to be a major target of NO. The mechanism of carcinogenesis of adenocarcinoma is not fully understood, but these results suggest that an excess of endogenously formed NO may induce a p53 gene mutation containing mainly G:C-to-T:A transversion in the early stage of lung adenocarcinoma. Our results suggest that NO has potential mutagenic and carcinogenic activity, and may play important roles in human lung adenocarcinoma",

    "Title": "p53 and ras mutations in Ewing's sarcoma",
    "Abstract": "The role of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes in the development of Ewing's sarcoma has not yet been fully clarified. In this study, we analyzed the frequency of p53 tumor suppressor gene mutation in exons 4- 8 by PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing, and the expression of p53-protein in Ewing's sarcoma (ES) by using immunohistochemistry. The overexpression of MDM2, which acts as a functional inactivator of p53, was studied by immunohistochemistry. In addition, a screening for point mutations in the hot spot regions codon 12 and 13 of exon 1 and codon 61 of exon 2 of ras-genes (H-ras, N-ras, K-ras) was performed. In one case, a p53 gene mutation could be confirmed in codon 238 of exon 7 (1/24). Overexpression of MDM2 was found in five cases; in ras-genes, no mutations were detected. Compared with other highly malignant mesenchymal pediatric tumors such as osteosarcomas, mutations of p53 and ras in Ewing's sarcomas are an extraordinarily rare event. However, their frequency is comparable to that of PNET, suggesting that the low incidence of these mutations in ES and PNET could be group-specific for tumors of neuroectodermal genesis",

    "Title": "Multiple myeloma in three siblings",
    "Abstract": "There have been 53 reported instances of myeloma occurring in more than one family member but in only three of these reports have three siblings been affected (Alexander & Benninghoff 1967; Maldonado & Kyle 1974; Horwitz et al. 1985; Crozes-Bony et al. 1995). We report a family where three siblings had an unequivocal diagnosis of myeloma made over a period of six years. The paraprotein isotype was IgG kappa in two of the siblings and kappa light chain only in the remaining sibling. The importance of these cases lies in the fact that they are highly suggestive of a genetic predisposition to the development of myeloma. Because of the high prevalence of p53 abnormalities in certain types of familial cancer screening for p53 mutation in exons 5-8 was performed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) on DNA extracted from the bone marrow of the three siblings. Although a p53 mutation was identified in one of the siblings it was felt to represent a somatic as opposed to a germline mutation",

    "Abstract": "Alterations of p53 have been explored in Taiwanese oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) consisting of a betel quid (BQ)/tobacco-related subgroup of 36 subjects and a tobacco-related subgroup of 13 subjects. Mutations in conserved exons were found in 12 tumors. Seven mutations were clustered in a hot-spot region mapped to a region between codons 273-282 in exon 8. The incidence of p53 mutation in BQ/tobacco tumors was 22% (8/36). The frequency of p53 allelic loss (21%, 3/14) in BQ/tobacco tumors approximates to the incidence of mutation. This is the first study demonstrating allelic deletion of p53 in such malignancies. Twenty-four of 43 samples showed positive p53 immunostaining. All tumors harboring mis-sense mutations of p53 in conserved exons exhibited nuclear protein accumulation. The incidence of mutation in conserved exons in BQ/tobacco-associated Asian OSCCs (15%) is significantly different from worldwide OSCCs (46%) related primarily to tobacco consumption (P=0.00001)",

    "Abstract": "p21(Waf1/Cipl) is a critical downstream effector in the p53-dependent pathway of growth control and causes growth arrest through inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases. In this study 67% of 43 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and 60% of 15 tumour-adjacent oral dysplasias overexpressed p21 by immunohistochemical staining. Overexpression of p21 in HNSCC was independent of the presence of functional p53, as assessed by analysis of mutations and loss of heterozygosity and by immunohistochemisty. Rather, the expression pattern of p21 was associated with differentiation. Furthermore, in most tumours, the p21 positive cells did not incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), which indicates inhibition of proliferation by p21 in these cells. In some tumours, p21 was also expressed in proliferating cells. In these latter tumour cells, cyclin D1 was frequently expressed as well. Therefore, we suggest that expression of cyclin D1 might overcome the inhibitory effect of p21 in these cells",

    "Title": "Sensitive detection of p53 gene mutations by a 'mutant enriched' PCR- SSCP technique",
    "Abstract": "For the rapid and sensitive detection of p53 'hot spot' mutations, we combined polymerase chain reaction based single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis with sequence specific-clamping by peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) in a one-step reaction tube protocol. For this purpose, we designed two PNA molecules comprising aa 246-250 of exon 7 and aa 270-275 of exon 8, respectively, to suppress the amplification of wild-type p53 allelic variants during PCR amplification. Using this method in a survey of 20 brush cytology samples from lung cancer patients, we were able to detect five p53 point mutations occurring in codons 248, 249 and 273 which could not be retrieved by conventional PCR-SSCP. Thus, allelic suppression by PNA molecules opens a way to largely improve the sensitivity of existing PCR-SSCP protocols (approximately 10-50-fold) and could be useful in the detection of 'hot spot' oncogene lesions in histological samples containing only a small number of cancer cells",

    "Abstract": "We determined the relationship between p53 expression and p53 gene mutations in squamous cell carcinoma occurring in scars and unrelated to UV light irradiation. We analyzed biopsy specimens obtained from three patients with squamous cell carcinoma. A monoclonal antibody against p53 (DO-7) was used for the immunohistochemical analysis. p53 gene mutations were detected by the polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing. p53 overexpression was observed in atypical squamous cells of one case. Those of two other cases, however, showed negative immunoreactivity to p53. Exon 6 of the p53 gene in all three cases and exon 7 in one case showed electrophoretic mobility shifts in polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. DNA sequencing analysis showed a missense mutation and a silent mutation in exon 6 of the case with p53 overexpression, a three-base deletion in exon 6 of one case with no p53 overexpression, and a three- base deletion in exon 6 and a missense mutation in exon 7 of another such case. Although immunohistochemical overexpression of p53 has been thought to result from p53 gene mutations, our results suggest that negative immunoreactivity to p53 also can result from p53 gene mutations, for example, short gene deletions",

    "Title": "Detection of p53 gene mutations in human leukemia by PCR-SSCP analysis and direct nucleotide sequencing",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To look for mutations of the p53 gene in leukemic patients and study the relationship between abnormalities in p53 gene and leukemogenesis. METHODS: The peripheral blood and Bone Marrow Samples were collected from 36 patients with various leukemia types including 14 cases of lymphocytic leukemia [8 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 4 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 2 cases of hairy cell leukemia (HCL)] and 22 cases of myelocytic leukemia [11 cases of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), 11 cases of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML)]. DNA structures of exon 5-8 of the p53 gene were scanned by PCR-SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction products). The appropriate DNA fragments were amplified, Purified and sequenced directly. RESULTS: By PCR-SSCP analysis, shifts in electrophoretic mobility of the p53 gene were detected in 3 of 14 patients with lymphocytic leukemia (2 ALL and 1 CLL), but none in 22 patients with myelocytic leukemia including one in blastic crisis. Direct nucleotide sequencing in one patient with ALL showed transition of CTG to CAG at codon 257 of exon 7, resulting in a change of its encoded amino acids from aspartic acid to valine. To our knowledge, the mutation at this codon has not been previously reported hitherto. CONCLUSIONS: The p53 gene mutations are specifically associated with lymphocytic leukemia. Alternations of the p53 gene may play a certain role in leukemogenesis in some cases of lymphocytic leukemia",

    "Title": "p53 status in radiation-induced soft-tissue sarcomas",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Following therapeutic irradiation after a latency period of many years radiation-induced tumors, often sarcomas, can arise. Results of radiation-induced DNA damage can be 1. p53 over-expression, inducing growth arrest or apoptosis, and 2. occurrence of mutations, frequently including the p53 gene, as one molecular promotor for carcinogenesis. We were interested whether radiation-induced sarcomas are associated with alterations of the p53 status. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples from 11 radiation-induced soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) were studied by a non- radioactive PCR-SSCP sequencing analysis and by immunohistochemistry with five antibodies for their p53 status. RESULTS: A tumor of one patient possessed a G->A transition in codon 280 (exon 8). Of 11 tumors, 9 showed nuclear p53 positivity, detected by monoclonal antibody DO-1. Of these 9 patients, 7 died during the observation period, whereas the 2 patients with DO-1 negative tumor samples are still alive. CONCLUSIONS: p53 over-expression and p53 mutation occur in radiation-induced STS. p53 status is expected to have prognostic impact for radiation-induced STS",

We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis to screen for the presence of mutations in the p53 gene of patients from Luxembourg and the German Saar region with colorectal cancers at various developmental stages. While we detected no mutations in 16 colic polypi at an early to intermediate stage (adenoma), we revealed seven (13.7%) non-silent point mutations (transitions) in exons 5 to 9 of the p53 gene in 51 colorectal tumors at a late stage (carcinoma). In addition to confirming previous observations, these results show that PCR-SSCP analysis can provide both a sensitive and rapid method for the genetic determination of the histopathological stage of colorectal samples",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Long standing ulcerative colitis (UC) has been known to be one of the precancerous diseases of colorectal cancer. Although the frequent loss of p53 allele (LOH) and aneuploidy were reported as the molecular events in carcinoma and dysplasia known as the precursor of UC, p53 genetic alteration was not reported in indefinite dysplasia and UC involved mucosa in long standing UC. Therefore, we investigated the mutational inactivation of the p53 gene in UC patients who showed dysplastic mucosa, as well as non-dysplastic mucosa on H & E stain and, secondly, if there is p53 mutation, we examined the relationship between p53 alteration and clinical data. METHOD: Sixteen patients with UC who had different duration of colitis were studied by endoscopic examination with rectal mucosal biopsies, p53 gene alterations were detected by PCR-SSCP for exon 4-8 and immunohistochemical staining with p53 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: Among 16 patients, 2 patients (12%) showed dysplasia on H-E stain. The p53 point mutations were detected in 4 (two dysplasia and 2 normal looking mucosa) on PCR-SSCP. 4 patients who had p53 gene mutation were positive in immunohistochemical staining. With regard to clinical characteristics, these patients with p53 point mutation showed poor response to medical treatment. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the p53 mutation may be an early molecular event of cancerous change in UC",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most common genetic alterations in a variety of human carcinomas. The sites of p53 mutations, however, vary in different cancers. The present study was designed to characterize p53 mutations in 40 primary human renal cancer specimens using hot-start-PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, sequencing of PCR product and immunohistochemistry. DNA extracted from microdissected paraffin-embedded sections was amplified by hot-start-PCR using oligonucleotide primers specific for exons 4-9 of p53. The mutations were analyzed by PCR-SSCP technique and the generated fragments were denatured and analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The samples showing a band shift were denatured and sequenced using the Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA Sequencing Kit (US Biochemical, Cleveland, Ohio). Genomic DNA from control samples containing wild-type p53 alleles was sequenced in parallel for confirming mutations in samples that were positive for p53 in the PCR-SSCP analysis. The results of these experiments demonstrate that: (1) there were mutations in p53 exon 5 and 8 in 35% (14 out of 40 samples) of human renal cancer tissues as revealed by PCR-SSCP analysis; (2) DNA sequencing of samples showing frame-shift have hot spot of p53 mutation on exon 8 at codon 244 (GGC-->TGC) and exon 5 at codon 132 [AAG (Lys)-->AGG (Arg)]. This mutation in p53 exon 5 at codon 132 is novel and has not yet been reported; (3) immunohistochemical staining of p53 in renal cancer tissue using mouse anti-human p53 monoclonal antibody, clone PAb 1801, correlated with the p53 mutation assessed by PCR-SSCP. No correlation was found between p53 mutations and tumor stage and grade of renal cancer",

    "Title": "Micropapillary serous carcinoma of the ovary: an immunohistochemical and mutational analysis of p53",
    "Abstract": "Micropapillary serous carcinoma (MPSC) has recently been described as a distinct ovarian neoplasm that shares histologic features with both serous borderline tumors (SBTs) and typical serous carcinomas of the ovary. To further define the relationship of MPSC to these two neoplasms, we evaluated all three tumor types for expression of the p53 protein and p53 gene mutations. The majority of MPSCs demonstrated positive, but only moderately intense, p53 immunostaining in >50% of the cells, whereas SBTs showed very weak staining in a small number of cells. In contrast, the majority of serous carcinomas displayed diffuse, very intense staining and those that did not stain completely lacked any staining for p53. This pattern of p53 immunostaining in MPSCs can be distinguished from the pattern observed in SBTs and in serous carcinomas. Both the MPSCs and the SBTs lacked p53 mutations in the cases analyzed, whereas all immunopositive serous carcinomas were found to have mutations in p53. In addition, one of the immunonegative cases of serous carcinoma had a frameshift mutation resulting in a truncated protein, providing a likely explanation for the lack of detectable p53 protein. These findings provide support for classifying MPSC as a distinct neoplasm of the ovary and suggest that increased expression of wild-type p53 may play a role in its pathogenesis",

    "Abstract": "We report an 83-year-old man with pancreatic body cancer of 4.5 cm in diameter. Peripheral leukocyte count was 15,700/microl and the serum concentration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was 123 pg/ml (normal, 6.0-21.9 pg/ml) on admission. Furthermore, not only K- ras codon 12 (GGT --> GAT) but also p53 at codon 247 (CGG --> CCG) mutations were identified in the pancreatic juice aspirated endoscopically. We performed chemotherapy with two courses of 5- fluorouracil, pirarubicin hydrochloride, and mitomycin-C, resulting in no beneficial effect. After the second course the patient developed interstitial pneumonia, probably caused by anticancer drugs, and died 4 months after the tumor was detected. In the autopsy tissue, the tumor macroscopically occupied the pancreas body and was 7 x 6 x 5 cm in size. Histopathologic diagnosis of the tumor was poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining of the autopsy tissue showed that pancreatic cancer cells were positive for G-CSF. This is the first case report of G-CSF-positive pancreatic cancer confirmed by immunohistochemistry",

    "Title": "Prevalences of Gs alpha, ras, p53 mutations and ret/PTC rearrangement in differentiated thyroid tumours in a Korean population",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In thyroid tumours, ras, Gs alpha, p53 mutations and ret/PTC rearrangement have been reported with variable prevalences in different geographical regions. We studied the prevalence of these mutations and rearrangement in thyroid tumours in a Korean population. As MDM2 and Bcl-1 protein expressions have been suggested to be associated with p53 protein, we also studied possible relationships among them. PATIENTS AND DESIGN: Eleven cases of adenomatous goitre, eight cases of follicular adenoma, five cases of follicular carcinoma and 37 cases of papillary carcinoma were included in this study. To find mutations and rearrangement, RT-PCR, SSCP and/or direct sequencing, after subcloning if necessary, were used, and immunohistochemical stainings were performed for p53, MDM2 and Bcl-2 proteins in cases of papillary carcinoma. RESULTS: We could not find any rearrangement for ret/PTC-1, - 2, -3 and mutation of Gs alpha. For the ras oncogene, K and H-ras mutations were not found, but N-ras mutations, point mutation of CAA to CGA in codon 61, were detected in one follicular adenoma (12.5%, 1/8) and one follicular carcinoma (33%, 1/3). p53 mutations were detected in only one case of papillary carcinoma (3%, 1/31: exon 8, codon 266 GGA-- >GAA). In 30 cases of papillary carcinoma without p53 mutation, the prevalences of positive immunohistochemical staining were 13.3% for p53 protein, 53.3% for MDM2 protein and 56.7% for Bcl-2 protein. While over- expression of p53 protein was not significantly related to that of MDM2 and Bcl-2 proteins, over-expression of MDM2 and Bcl-2 in papillary carcinoma were associated. CONCLUSION: ret/PTC rearrangement, Gs alpha, ras and p53 mutations are relatively rare in differentiated thyroid neoplasms from a Korean population, which may reflect genetic and environmental differences from patients in countries with high prevalences. P53 protein over-expression was noted in 13.3% of papillary carcinoma cases without p53 mutation and was not significantly related to MDM2 and Bcl-2 expression",

    "Abstract": "The occurrence of acute transformation during the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is still a poorly understood mechanism. In this disease p53, p16INK4A, p15INK4B, p57KIP2 mutations and p15INK4B/p16INK4A homo/hemizygous deletions were analyzed in the initial diagnosis phase and during the treatment phase of twelve CML cases, in order to establish whether there was a consistent molecular genetic alteration in its progression. During the treatment period, four of twelve cases had blastic crisis. All the mutations observed in p53, p16INK4A and p15INK4B cumulated in three out of four CML cases who had blastic crises. In one case, p53 codon 282 mutation (CGG-->TGG; arg- ->trp) were observed in initial diagnosis. Seven months later, G-->C transition in the 3' side of p15 cDNA (778. nucleotide) was observed in the accelerated phase with the same p53 codon 282 mutation. Thirteen months later, this patient died as a result of blastic crisis. The patient in blastic crises in the initial diagnosis phase had a mis- sense point mutation in p16 codon 69 (ACT-->AGT; thr-->ser) and a polymorphism in codon 68 (GCC-->GCG). Six months later, this patient also died. In one case, p53 codon 237 mutation (ATG-->ATA; met-->ile) were observed in the initial diagnosis phase. Then months later, the patient died as a result of blastic crises. No p15INK4B/p16INK4A homo/hemizygous deletion and p57KIP2 gene mutation which was described in the same pathway were observed in CML progression. These results indicate that p15INK4B and p16INK4A gene alterations may have an affect on the progression of CML-like p53 mutation. A correlation was found with the progression of CML and p53, p15INK4B and p16INK4A somatic mutations. Finding p15INK4B and p16INK4A gene alteration as well as p53 mutations may be a prognostic marker in patients with CML",

    "Title": "[Genetic alterations in the fibroblastic stroma of invasive colon and breast carcinomas]",
    "Abstract": "While the neoplastic cells have always been in the center of interest in cancer research in recent years, more and more attention has been paid also to the tumor stroma which is today known to play an important role for tumor progression. In early days of histology the interpretation of stroma as either neoplastic or reactive was still a matter of discussion. Today's generally held view is clearly in favor of a secondary induction by tumor cell derived factors. Recent findings of epithelium-mesenchymal transitions of cultured tumor cells now put again a doubt on this exclusive interpretation. In the present work we show for the first time that genetic alterations (allelic losses, microsatellite instabilities and p53 mutations) are not restricted to tumor cells but also occur within the fibroblastic stroma of non- hereditary invasive human colon and breast cancers. In view of the clonality of epithelial and stromal components in the same cases (loss of same alleles and identical MSI patterns) epithelium-mesenchymal transitions are among possible explanations for these findings which could shed a new light on the true nature of tumor stroma",

    "Title": "Pediatric brain tumors: loss of heterozygosity at 17p and TP53 gene mutations",
    "Abstract": "Cytogenetic and molecular analyses of primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) of the central nervous system (CNS) have demonstrated material losses of 17p, the region that contains the TP53 gene, as the most frequent abnormality. Mutations in the TP53 gene are, however, very rare in these tumors. These findings strongly suggest that another, as yet unidentified, gene on 17p may be involved. We performed a search for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 17p by microsatellite markers on 26 childhood CNS tumors as well as TP53 gene mutations (exons 5-8) by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis on 41 pediatric brain tumor samples of distinct histologic types. LOH was detected in 10 cases: 7 PNET, 2 astrocytomas, and 1 glioblastoma multiforme. In 4 of the PNETs the losses were limited to more distal markers. On the other hand, TP53 mutations were detected in 6 of 41 samples studied. Our results not only confirm the low penetrance of the TP53 gene on pediatric CNS tumors, but also provide further evidence of a putative tumor suppressor gene distal to TP53, between markers (D17S938, D17S926) and 17pter, specifically taking part in the development of PNET",

Normally, p53 is not immunodetectable. Missense TP53 mutations have been reported to result in p53 accumulation and detection, but mutations generating premature stop codons have not. Mutations were identified in 19 of 41 malignant tumors but not in 5 benign tumors and 2 tumors of low malignant potential. Fifteen of the 19 tumors with mutations also stained positively by immunohistochemistry or Western blot or both. They included 11 missense mutations, 1 in-frame duplication (474ins6), and 3 frameshift mutations generating premature stop codons. The three tumors with frameshifts also had a wild-type TP53 allele and displayed normal size but not truncated p53 by Western blot. This indicates that these tumors express wild-type p53. The significance of TP53 mutations in the development of the three tumors is questionable unless there is a mechanism for inactivating wild-type p53. Nine of the 19 mutations found here, including the 3 frameshifts, were previously not reported in ovarian cancer. Thirteen of the 19 mutations were single nucleotide substitutions with 6 transitions and 7 transversions. The ratio of transversions to transitions (1.2) was different from literature reports (0.5) (P < 0.01). Thus, the spectrum of TP53 mutations in our study differed from other ovarian tumor reports. This difference may be due to population-based differences in the molecular epidemiology of TP53 mutations",

    "Abstract": "Samples of 18 osteosarcomas were examined for the occurrence of apoptosis and TP53 status. Apoptosis was investigated by an in situ nick translation technique on paraffin-embedded samples. It was found that apoptosis rarely occurs in osteosarcoma at the early stage of disease, whereas it is frequently activated when tumors are treated with antiblastic drugs. The analysis of the TP53 gene showed no mutation at diagnosis; whereas, during disease progression, four cases showed TP53 mutations. The authors discuss the relation between apoptosis, TP53 status, and therapy",

    "Title": "Molecular and biological features of two new human squamous and adenocarcinoma of the lung cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Two human cancer cell lines were established from metastatic lesions of an adenocarcinoma (RAL) and a squamous cell (CAEP) carcinoma of the lung. The clinical histories of the patients from whom the cell lines were derived are reported. The lines were maintained in continuous culture with doubling times of 65 (RAL) and 50 (CAEP) hours. The RAL and CAEP cell lines, whose morphology and ultrastructural features are presented, showed extensively rearranged karyotypes with modal number of 85 (RAL) and 98 (CAEP). In particular, chromosome 2 pentasomy and several clonal markers were evident in the RAL cells, whereas a telomeric deletion of chromosome 1, del (1)(q32), was observed in the CAEP cells. The morphologic data were confirmed by high expression of specific antigens for each histotype. A marked positivity of the neuron- specific enolase (NSE) levels was evident by immunoenzymatic assays in the cell lines cytosol with respect to those present in the respective patient's sera. No amplification or rearrangements were evident in the CMYC, LMYC, NMYC, INT-2, ERBB2, HRAS, KRAS, MOS, HST-1 genes by Southern blotting analysis in each cell line. Point mutations in exon 1 of KRAS and in exon 7 of TP53 were evident by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-DNA sequencing in the RAL cell line, whereas no alterations were present in the HRAS and RB genes. The four genes studied did not show point mutations in the CAEP cell line. The RAL cell line was resistant to all the drugs tested, whereas the CAEP cells were sensitive to vinblastine. These cell lines may represent useful experimental models to investigate lung cancer biology and anticancer drug response",

    "Title": "5' region and exon 7 mutations of the TP53 gene in two cases of B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia",
    "Abstract": "We previously found that cases of typical B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), atypical B-CLL with t(11;14) and mantle cell lymphomas characterized by rapid progression of the disease and resistance to therapy, had mutations of the TP53 gene. In this paper, abnormalities of the TP53 gene were investigated in two cases of prolymphocytic leukemia, one with t(11;14)(q13;q32), evolving from atypical CLL (patient 1), and one presenting as a de novo condition (patient 2). TP53 DNA was investigated by Southern blot and PCR-SSCP analysis, and TP53 expression was investigated by Northern blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. C-MYC and BCL-1/PRAD1 gene expression were also investigated. Restriction enzyme analysis of TP53 DNA in patient 1 showed alteration of fragments including exon I and intron I, and, in both patients, a specific loss of TP53 DNA. In patient 2, PCR direct sequencing showed in exon VII a 9 bp deletion including codons 252-254. In patient 1, TP53 RNA and protein were not found, indicating that the unusual 5' rearrangement has affected TP53 gene expression. By contrast, patient 2 exhibited detectable TP53 RNA and protein. Detectable but weak BCL-1/PRAD1 RNA was present in both patients, whereas C-MYC RNA expression was clearly present only in case 1. The presence of TP53 hemizygous mutations in both patients suggests that TP53 abnormalities may be important in the pathogenesis of prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), and may possibly account for the frequent resistance to therapy observed in this disease",

    "Abstract": "The gemistocytic astrocytoma is a histological variant of diffuse astrocytomas and is characterised by the presence of large, GFAP- expressing neoplastic astrocytes (gemistocytes) and a tendency towards rapid progression to glioblastoma. In this study, we analyzed 28 gemistocytic astrocytomas (mean fraction of gemistocytes, 35.0+/-9.9%) for mutations in the p53 and PTEN (MMAC1) tumour suppressor genes. Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), followed by direct DNA sequencing of p53 exons 5-8, revealed a mutation in 23 of 28 (82%) cases. Regional analysis of four tumours revealed identical p53 mutations in gemistocytic and fibrillary tumour areas. In contrast, none of 15 gemistocytic astrocytomas (WHO Grade II) and only two of 11 (18%) anaplastic gemistocytic astrocytomas (WHO Grade III) contained a PTEN mutation. Of these, one was a 1 bp deletion in codon 345 and the other a 1 bp insertion in intron 4. Differential PCR did not reveal homozygous PTEN deletion in any of the tumours analysed. These results indicate that p53 mutations are a genetic hallmark of gemistocytic astrocytomas, whilst PTEN mutations are absent in low-grade and rare in anaplastic gemistocytic astrocytomas",

    "Abstract": "While it is established that p53 mutation plays a critical role in the carcinogenesis of astrocytic brain tumors, its role remains to be clarified for other types of tumors in the central nervous system (CNS). Using a yeast-based assay which tests the ability of human p53 to activate transcription, we analyzed p53 mutations in 85 non- astrocytic CNS tumors, including 4 benign neuronal tumors (3 central neurocytomas and 1 pineocytoma), 12 primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 14 germ cell tumors (7 germinomas, 7 non-germinomatous tumors), 4 craniopharyngiomas, 14 ependymomas, 22 schwannomas, 10 primary brain lymphomas in immunocompetent patients, and 5 bone tumors of the skull. The only tumors found to contain p53 mutations were 3 malignant lymphomas. The presence of mutations in these cases was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Given the high accuracy and sensitivity of the yeast assay and previous negative results using conventional techniques, this indicates that p53 mutation is a rare event in non-astrocytic CNS tumor types examined here",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the abnormal expression of p53 protein in a series of 34 ampullomas with the monoclonal antibody DO7 directed against p53 protein. Mutations of exons 5 to 8 of p53 gene were also detected by PCR followed by denaturating gel electrophoresis and sequencing. RESULTS: One of 5 adenomas (20%) and 16 of 29 adenocarcinomas (55%) were p53 positive by immunohistochemistry. A constant feature was the presence of p53 positive glands in the surrounding dysplastic mucosa of p53 positive infiltrative lesions. There was no correlation between p53 immunostaining and tumor stage. Among the 19 tumors analyzed, 6 mutations were detected. CONCLUSION: p53 gene mutations and p53 protein immunoreactivity are frequently present in ampullomas. Because these alterations are not correlated to tumor extension and occur at an early stage in the carcinogenesis, their detection does not appear to be contributive for diagnosis of ampullary tumors",

    "Abstract": "AIMS AND METHODS: We studied the mechanisms of colon and rectal carcinogenesis by analysing in a series of 83 rectal tumors the prevalence of the two tumor types characteristic of colon cancer, i.e., the LOH+ type, defined by p53 and APC mutations (studied by DGGE and protein truncation assay), and the RER+ type, which is characterized by the instability of some mononucleotide repeat microsatellites (Bat 25 and Bat 26). Additionally, we analyzed the occurrence of Ki-Ras mutations (direct sequencing). RESULTS: Only one tumor turned out to be RER+. Moreover, in 59% of the tumor cases mutations were found in p53, essentially affecting codon 175. The APC and Ki-Ras genes were found to be mutated in 40 and 26% of the rectal tumors, respectively. In 18 tumors (21%) none of the genes studied were mutated. CONCLUSIONS: The RER+ phenotype is rare among rectal tumors, which are essentially LOH+. In these LOH+ tumors the p53 gene is more frequently mutated than in colorectal tumors with the same phenotype. Mutations in the APC and Ki- Ras genes, on the other hand, are less frequent in rectal tumors. Tumors with the RER- and LOH- phenotype may develop as a result of a third carcinogenesis model which must be defined",

    "Abstract": "Frequent frameshift mutations of simple nucleotide repeats in the protein-encoding regions, as well as replication errors (RERs) at microsatellite loci, have recently been demonstrated in gastrointestinal tumors. These genetic instabilities have been considered indicative of an increased risk of accumulating mutations in cancer-associated genes and of developing multiple cancers. We studied frameshift (or insertion/deletion) mutations of simple nucleotide repeats in five genes (TGFbeta type II receptor [TGFbetaRII], E2F4, MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6) in 23 tumors from 12 patients who had synchronous cancers of the esophagus and other organs. Genetic instability at four microsatellite loci, as well as mutations in the TP53, APC, and KRAS2 genes, were also studied. No frameshift mutations were observed in the TGFbetaRII, MSH3, and MSH6 genes. RER and a deletion mutation of BAT26 in MSH2 were present in one (1/23; 4%) gastric cancer. This tumor also carried a deletion mutation in the serine (AGC) repeat of the E2F4 gene. Mutation screening of the TP53, APC, and KRAS2 genes revealed that the synchronous cancers did not carry the same mutations. Our results suggested that genetic instability, such as insertion/deletion mutations in simple nucleotide repeats, is not significantly associated with the development of multiple primary cancers of the esophagus and other organs, and that these synchronous cancers developed independently according to their different environmental factors",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and type of p53 gene mutation with the progression of human gastric carcinogenesis. METHODS: Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing were performed on 56 biopsied tissues, including gastric cancer (n = 23), dysplasia (Dys, n = 16) and intestinal metaplasia (IM, n = 17). RESULTS: p53 gene mutation was detected in 60.1% of cancer, 31.3% of Dys and 11.8% of IM. Mutations covered exon 5-8 without hot spot. GC-- >AT transitions (30.4%) and GC-->TA transversions (26.1%) were the major patterns of p53 mutation. Missense (73.9%) and frame shift mutations covered 86.9% of all mutations. CONCLUSION: In the process of human gastric carcinogenesis, multiple factors are involved in p53 gene mutations. The mutation rate increases with the progression of malignant changes in the gastric mucosa. Missense and frame shift mutations are possibly the major cause of p53 inactivation",

We examined biopsy material from patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma for p53 protein expression and p53 mutations. METHODS: Eighteen samples were analyzed. These comprised oral squamous cell carcinoma biopsy samples and oral dysplastic biopsy material taken from nine patients. An immunohistochemical technique was used to determine p53 protein expression. A direct sequencing technique was used to detect mutations in the p53 gene itself. RESULTS: Overall seven of nine (77%) oral squamous cell carcinomas and seven of nine (77%) oral dysplastic lesions analyzed showed evidence of p53 protein over- expression. Mutations in exons 5 and 6 of the p53 gene were detected in five of nine (55%) oral squamous cell carcinomas and four of nine (44%) dysplastic lesions analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Both p53 protein over- expression and p53 mutations were noted in dysplastic oral lesions. Over-expression of the p53 protein and p53 gene mutations were not always coexistent, however, suggesting that gene mutation may be only one of the mechanisms responsible for stabilization of the p53 protein",

METHODS: p53 mutations in exon 5 to 7 were detected by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing technique. RESULTS: 8 of 46 tumor tissues demonstrated a SSCP band shift in the region of the gene. All of them have been characterized to represent DNA alterations by sequencing, including 8 point mutations (6 missence, 1 silent mutation and 1 in intron) and a 1- base pair insertion (introducing a stop codon downstream). Overall, 88.9% of mutation were transitions, and most of them are G-->A transitions (7/8, 87.5%). 62.5% of the mutation were found in 175 and 245 codon. The percentage of the mutation in stage I and stage II was 20.0%, and in stage III and stage IV was 16.7% (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The arising of p53 mutations in ovarian cancer is due to spontaneous error in DNA synthesis and repair. Codon 175, 245 are the two mutational hot spots.

    "Abstract": "Cyclophosphamide is a known bladder carcinogen, with cumulative dose directly related to increased risk. There is no consensus, however, on which major cyclophosphamide metabolite (i.e., acrolein or phosphoramide mustard) drives bladder carcinogenesis. We examined 19 cyclophosphamide-related bladder tumors to test the hypothesis that they might contain somatic mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene that could link a specific metabolite to the etiology of these cancers. Forty-three % (9 of 19) of the cases had a mutation in p53, with a predominance at G:C bp (7 of 9, 77%), a preference for non-CpG sites (6 of 7, 86%), and frequent G:C-->A:T transitions (5 of 7, 71%). The p53 mutation spectrum of these cyclophosphamide-associated bladder cancers differed significantly from patterns reported for sporadic (P = 0.020), smoking-related (0.043), and schistosomiasis-linked (P = 0.002) tumors but not arylamine-associated neoplasms (P = 0.860). Differences between the cyclophosphamide and arylamine-associated spectra included an unusual degree of clustering of exon 6 mutations (43% versus 17%, respectively) and an absence of multiple mutations in the former. Notably lacking in our series were G:C-->T:A transversions, the principal mutation associated with acrolein. Instead, the mutation spectrum matches the phosphoramide mustard adduction sequences determined by a repetitive primer-extension assay (P = 0.024), indicating that this metabolite might be a key mutagen in cyclophosphamide-related bladder cancer",

In contrast to previous studies of malignant glioma, the prevalence of transversion mutations (56%) was higher than transition mutations (33%). A large proportion of transversion mutations occurred in exon 4, a region that is not routinely screened in gliomas. We present here an improved method for screening exon 4 (and other GC-rich regions) of p53 using PCR-single-strand conformation analysis.

Of 42 tumors, 22 (52.4%) harbored 25 alterations identified by PCR amplification and direct sequencing (13 of 22 tumors from Niigata and 12 of 20 tumors from Santiago). All alterations were single base pair substitutions, 20 (80%) leading to an amino acid substitution or a chain-termination signal, and 5 (20%) were silent. Immunohistochemically, 55 of 84 cases (65.5%) showed overexpression of p53 protein, with no significant difference in frequency between the two areas. Missense mutations correlated highly with overexpression of the p53 protein (93.4%). Mutations of p53 occurred in all four exons examined, most commonly in exon 5, but in no particular 'hot spot.' In base-change spectra, all 12 mutations from Santiago showed transitions, with 4 arising at the CpG dinucleotide (33.3%). In contrast, no such transition was found at CpG sites in Niigata, and 4 of 13 mutations (30.8%) were transversions. The data indicated that p53 mutations are highly important in carcinogenesis in the gallbladder. In addition, the difference in p53 mutational spectra in Niigata and Santiago indicate a likely regional difference in mutagenesis",

    "Abstract": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) and p53 mutations have been reported to occur in a significant proportion of patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MSH2 is one of the genes involved in DNA mismatch repair to maintain fidelity of genomic replication, and defects of MSH2 are directly involved in MSI in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal tumors and other human tumors. We have examined the expression of MSH2 protein by Western blotting in 43 adult leukemia samples, including 42 AML and 1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using the antibody MSH2 (Ab-1) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Abnormal expression of MSH2 protein was found in 14 of 43 (32.6%) cases; a control antibody to actin was always positive. Of the 14 patients that had abnormal expression of MSH2, 2 had therapy-related acute leukemia and 9 were elderly patients (>60 years of age). Expression of MSH2 mRNA was further examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Deletion of MSH2 mRNA was found in 1 of 14 cases with deficient MSH2 protein expression. This group of patients was also screened for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the MSH2 locus using a panel 4 microsatellite markers (D2S367, D2S288, D2S391, and D2S2294). LOH was found in 5 of 11 cases examined. There was no evidence of LOH in 14 patients with normal MSH2 expression who were examined using the same markers. Functional evidence for defective DNA mismatch repair in leukemic cells lacking MSH2 as manifest by MSI was found in 7 of 11 cases studied. Mutations of the p53 gene in these 43 samples were also investigated by direct sequencing of full-length p53 cDNA. Mutations of p53 were found in 6 of 43 cases, including 5 of the 14 (35.7%) cases that did not express MSH2 protein. In contrast, mutation of p53 was only found in 1 of 29 (3.4%) cases with normal MSH2 protein expression (chi2 = 5.720, P <.02). These results suggest that abnormalities of DNA mismatch repair due to defective MSH2 expression could play a key role in leukemogenesis, in particular in AML arising in elderly patients or secondary to previous chemotherapy",

RESULTS: A total of 8 metaplastic lesions (1 squamous metaplasia and 7 dysplasias) and 3 alveolar hyperplastic lesions (with atypia) showed genetic alterations, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 3p, 9p and mutations of the p53 gene. In an analysis of microsatellite markers, 5 of 35 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 3 of 26 cases of adenocarcinoma (Ad) showed LOH in both preneoplastic lesions and synchronous cancers. Nine patients (25.7%) with SCC and 6 patients (23.1%) with Ad were shown to have mutations of the p53 gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism. In 2 of these 9 patients with SCC, the same mutation was observed in both dysplasia and SCC. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that several genetic alterations may occur in preneoplastic lesions or the early stage of SCC of the lung, whereas the genetic alterations examined appeared to occur relatively late in the pathogenesis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma",

    "Title": "Genetic changes in the spectrum of neuroendocrine lung tumors",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent classifications identify four categories of neuroendocrine (NE) tumors of the lung: low grade typical carcinoid (TC), intermediate grade atypical carcinoid (AC), and high grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LC-NEC) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). METHODS: The authors studied the molecular changes present in 59 archival NE tumors (10TCs, 11 ACs, 18 LNECs, and 20 SCLCs). Utilizing microdissection and polymerase chain reaction-based assays, the authors examined loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at ten chromosomal regions frequently deleted in lung tumors (3p, 5q, 11q, 13q, and 17p) and for mutations at the p53 and ras genes. RESULTS: With the exception of ras gene mutations, the majority of these changes frequently were present in carcinomas and were present at lower frequencies in carcinoids. LOH at one or more 3p regions was the most frequent change found in the carcinoids. A relatively high incidence of LOH at the MEN1 gene was common in all NE lung tumors. The incidence of LOH and p53 gene abnormalities progressively increased with increasing severity of tumor type. The patterns of p53 gene mutations were different between AC and high grade NE tumors. LOH at 5q21 was correlated with poor survival in the carcinoid group. CONCLUSIONS: Although NE lung tumors have varied etiologies, the results of the current study support the clinicopathologic concept that they represent a spectrum ranging from low grade TC to the highly malignant NE carcinomas",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations and rearrangements in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alterations of the p53 gene have been associated with the progression of certain human malignancies. To establish further the correlation between p53 gene alterations and progression of non- Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), the authors analyzed both mutations and rearrangements of the p53 gene in a cohort of 84 NHLs. METHODS: Eighty- four NHLs were analyzed for p53 gene alterations. Point mutations of exons 5-9 were studied by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), and DNA rearrangements were studied by Southern blot analysis. RESULTS. Point mutations and DNA rearrangements of the p53 gene were detected in 6 (7.2%) and 3 (3.6%) patients, respectively. All p53 gene abnormalities were found exclusively in B-cell NHLs. Taken together, patients with p53 gene alterations had poorer survival than other patients (P = 0.024). However, of the three patients with p53 gene rearrangements, the two who appeared to have one normal allele showed a relatively better response to chemotherapy and had longer survival (27 and 47 months). In contrast, the remaining patient who had rearranged bands much stronger than the germline, and thus appeared to have both alleles rearranged, was refractory to chemotherapy and had poorer survival (6 months). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NHLs of intermediate and high grades who carried point mutations or rearrangements of p53 genes had worse outcomes than other patients. Patients with one abnormal p53 allele and one residual normal allele had a more favorable prognosis than those with two abnormal alleles",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation with cyclin D1 overexpression commonly is found in multiple myeloma (MM) and in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Several reports have shown that p53 mutations in MCL lead to blastoid transformation and a worse prognosis; however, the role of p53 mutations in MM with t(11;14) is unclear. METHODS: In this study the authors describe a patient with MM with t(11;14) and a p53 mutation at presentation and characterized a cell line, MEF-1, established from this patient. Immunohistochemical analysis of p53 and cyclin D1 proteins was performed. The p53 gene was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. The expression of cyclin D1 mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis. RESULTS: MEF-1 had t(11;14) with overexpression of cyclin D1 mRNA and produced immunoglobulin kappa-light chain. MEF-1 had a mutation in exon 7 (codon 255-257) of the p53 gene, which was noted in the patient's myeloma cells. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations may be important genetic events in disease progression of MM with t(11;14). The MEF-1 cell line may be a useful tool to study mechanisms of progression in MM based on abnormalities of the cyclin D1 gene",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The correlation between tumor microsatellite instability (MSI) and the accumulation of mutations in KRAS2 and TP53 is uncertain. The authors evaluated the TP53 and KRAS2 genes for mutations in sporadic endometrial carcinomas with microsatellite instability (MSI) and matched MSI negative controls to determine whether defective DNA mismatch repair impacts the patterns of mutations in two genes known to be involved in endometrial tumorigenesis. METHODS: Twenty-five MSI positive endometrial tumors were matched for prognostic factors with 25 MSI negative tumors. Mutations in codon 12 and 13 of KRAS2 were assessed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction assay. Mutations in codon 61 of KRAS2 and exons 5-8 of TP53 were evaluated using PCR amplification and single strand conformation variant (SSCV) analysis. All variants were subjected to direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: KRAS2 and TP53 mutations were identified with equal frequency in the MSI positive and MSI negative groups. For TP53, the authors identified 5 mutations (20%) in the MSI positive specimens compared with 8 (32%) in the MSI negative group. For KRAS2, there were identified 8 mutations (32%) in the MSI positive specimens compared with 7 (28%) in the MSI negative tumors. The mutational spectra evident from sequence analysis of TP53 and KRAS2 variants were similar between MSI negative and MSI positive tumors. MSI negative tumors were more likely to have mutations in both KRAS2 and TP53 than MSI positive tumors, which were rarely mutant in both genes (P=0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall frequency of mutations in TP53 and KRAS2 is similar, MSI positive tumors are less likely to have mutations in both genes than MSI negative sporadic endometrial carcinomas. MSI positive and MSI negative endometrial carcinomas may arise through distinct genetic pathways",

    "Title": "Combined yolk sac tumor and adenocarcinoma in a gastric stump: molecular evidence of clonality",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extragonadal yolk sac tumors of the gastrointestinal tract are extremely rare neoplasms. Their greater rarity compared with other extragonadal yolk sac tumors suggests that different pathogenetic mechanisms could be involved according to the site of origin. This report describes a case of a combined yolk sac tumor and adenocarcinoma that arose in a gastric stump in a man age 61 years 43 years after he underwent distal gastric resection and gastrojejunostomy (Billroth II operation) for a benign duodenal ulcer. The coexistence of an adenocarcinomatous component with the yolk sac component suggests that the two histologic patterns may represent distinct phenotypes arising from a common mucosal epithelial cell. METHODS: Immunohistochemical and molecular techniques were used to define the mutation pattern of p53 in both components of the tumor. RESULTS: Single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analyses demonstrated the same pattern of p53 mutation in the adenocarcinomatous and yolk sac tumor components. CONCLUSIONS: This finding suggests that the two tumors could have been derived from the same cellular clone and supports the hypothesis that the two components represented a heterogeneous differentiation of the same tumor",

    "Title": "Chemosensitivity and p53-dependent apoptosis in epithelial ovarian carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although p53 gene mutation frequently is observed in ovarian carcinoma, the function of the p53 gene in chemosensitivity has not been defined conclusively. The objective of the current study was to elucidate the relation between chemotherapy-induced apoptosis through the p53 pathway and chemosensitivity to ovarian carcinoma. METHODS: Tumor samples were obtained from 24 patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma before and after chemotherapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. Mutations in the p53 gene were screened by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and determined by cycle sequencing. Expression of the p53, Bax, and bcl-2 proteins and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were determined by immunohistochemical staining. Apoptotic cells were detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin nick-end labeling method. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients, 12 responded to chemotherapy and 12 did not. p53 gene mutation was observed in ten nonresponders and two responders. The incidence of p53 protein expression in tumors with the gene mutation was 58% (7 of 12) and was 17% (2 of 12) in tumors without the gene mutation. A significant reverse correlation between apoptotic index (AI) and labeling index (LI), determined by the percentage of PCNA positive cells, was observed in tumors after chemotherapy. AI was found to increase significantly after chemotherapy in tumors with the wild- type p53 gene (3.84 +/- 1.64 vs. 7.13 +/- 5.23) but LI did not change in either tumor type. The expression of Bax protein was significantly greater in tumors with the wild-type p53 gene after chemotherapy. bcl-2 protein expression did not relate to p53 gene status before or after chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that p53- dependent apoptosis in tumors is strongly related to the chemosensitivity in epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Copyright 1999 American Cancer Society",

    "Title": "K-ras and p53 mutations in the pathogenesis of classical and goblet cell carcinoids of the appendix",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mutations in the K-ras oncogene and the p53 tumor suppressor gene are present in approximately 50% of colonic adenocarcinomas. Goblet cell carcinoids (GCCs) are uncommon neoplasms of the appendix that appear to be intermediate between carcinoid tumors and adenocarcinomas, both histologically and biologically. The current study was undertaken to examine the role of p53 and K-ras mutations in the pathogenesis of GCCs and typical carcinoids (TCs) of the appendix. METHODS: Archival materials from 22 GCCs and 18 TCs were analyzed. K- ras mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 were studied by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based designed restriction fragment length polymorphism method using mismatched nested primers. Mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene were analyzed in 16 GCCs and 18 TCs by PCR and single-strand conformational polymorphism followed by direct sequencing. Immunostains for p53 and chromogranin were performed in all cases. RESULTS: K-ras mutations and nuclear accumulation of p53 by immunohistochemistry were not detected in any of the GCCs or TCs. p53 mutations were found in 4 of 16 GCCs (25%) and 8 of 18 TCs (44%). Immunoreactivity for chromogranin was seen in the vast majority of GCCs and TCs. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations appear to play a role in the pathogenesis of some GCCs and in approximately 50% of TCs of the appendix, whereas mutations in the K-ras oncogene do not appear to be important in the development of these tumors. The minimal cytologic atypia, low incidence of metastases, and lack of K-ras mutations in goblet cell appendiceal neoplasms suggest that they are variants of carcinoid tumors. Our findings lend support to the recommendation that the therapeutic guidelines applied to TCs of the appendix should be the same for GCCs",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to establish the pattern of specific p53 gene mutations in prostate cancer within primary tumors and distant metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analyses of p53 exons 5-8 in DNA extracted from 22 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 17 patients. Samples from three patients included specimens from primary and metastatic sites (paired specimens). RESULTS: G:C-to-A:T transitions were the most common point mutations (64%). Six (55%) of 11 G:C-to-A:T transitions occurred at CpG dinucleotides in five hot-spot codons (175, 245, 248, 273, and 282). Sequencing analysis of the paired samples revealed that two of the three pairs had the same mutation in both. Sequencing analysis of DNA from a different area of one of the primary tumors revealed a different mutation in the p53 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that specific p53 mutations participate in the progression of human prostate cancer. These findings support those of others that indicate that the primary cancer is heterogeneous and clonal expansion occurs during the progression of clinically detectable prostate cancer. Our data also imply that p53 mutations at the primary site may be predictive of metastases",

    "Title": "Immunohistochemical detection of p53 protein overexpression versus gene sequencing in urinary bladder carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Mutations of p53 tumor suppressor gene and nuclear accumulation of p53 protein are common in bladder tumors. The prognostic significance of p53 alterations in bladder tumors has not been established. The aim of the present study was to evaluate an immunohistochemical (IHC) method for the routine determination of p53 protein overexpression in human bladder tumors and to determine the relation between nuclear accumulation of p53 with the traditional prognostic indicators and patient survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 104 transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder were analyzed simultaneously by immunohistochemistry for p53 protein overexpression and direct DNA sequencing for p53 gene mutations. RESULTS: The overexpression of p53 protein was reported in 30.8% of the cases and mutations of p53 gene in 23.0%. A significant association was observed between p53 alterations established either by IHC or direct DNA sequencing and stage (p<0.0001), grade (p<0.001), vascular invasion (p = 0.0005), DNA ploidy (p = 0.0002) and carcinoma in situ (p<0.0001). The correlation between the p53 gene mutations and p53 nuclear reactivity as detected by IHC was highly significant (p<0.0001). Univariate statistical analysis showed that the expression of p53 was significantly correlated to poor prognosis (p<0.0001). However, in multivariate analysis, only stage was significantly correlated to prognosis (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The IHC method was highly sensitive and specific and simple to apply for the routine examination of p53 overexpression in bladder tumors. However, overexpression of p53 as determined immunohistochemically, does not appear to have a better predictive prognostic value than stage in bladder tumors",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mutant-allele-specific amplification (MASA) method is capable of detecting 1 genetically altered tumor cell among thousands of normal cells. The MASA enabled us to detect occult tumor cells undetectable by histopathologic examination of lymph nodes and blood samples. METHODS: To investigate whether tumor manipulation during operation enhances cancer cell dissemination into the portal vein with use of MASA and to assess the effect of the no-touch isolation technique in the treatment of colorectal cancers, 27 colorectal cancers (17 were operated on conventionally and 10 were operated on according to the no-touch isolation technique) were screened for mutations in K- ras or p53. We next examined blood samples of the portal vein collected before, during, and after manipulation of tumors, using MASA to look for the specific mutation found in the primary tumors. RESULTS: Somatic mutations were identified in 18 of these primary tumors (11 were in the conventional resection technique group and 7 were in the no-touch isolation technique group). In 8 of 11 (73%) conventional resection technique cases, we identified the same genetic alteration of the primary tumor in the portal blood during operation, whereas only 1 patient (14%) in the no-touch isolation technique group had a positive result. CONCLUSIONS: The no-touch isolation technique may be useful to prevent cancer cells from being shed into the portal vein during surgical manipulation",

    "Abstract": "Thyroid carcinoma with an insular component (TCIC) is considered noteworthy in view of its peculiar histopathological features and clinicopathological behavior. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the rate of mutation in the p53 gene in TCIC as compared with rates in papillary and follicular carcinomas of the thyroid. Formalin- fixed and paraffin-embedded blocks of tissue from 46 cases of TCIC were analyzed. DNA was extracted from tissues and exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. Mutations were detected by analysis of single-strand conformation polymorphism. Of the 46 cases of TCIC, 6 had a mutation in exon 5, 2 in exon 7, and 5 in exon 8, while 1 case had mutations in all exons examined. The mutation rate of the p53 gene in TCIC was 38%. Immunostaining revealed overexpression of p53 in nuclei that were mainly in areas of the insular component rather than in surrounding areas of well- differentiated carcinoma. The frequency of positive immunostaining in TCIC was 53%. Considering that TCIC is intermediate between papillary plus follicular carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma in terms of survival and the rate of mutation of the p53 gene, we can speculate that mutation in the p53 gene might be associated with the insular component and might play an important role in the clinicopathological behavior of thyroid carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "In the present study, TP53 alterations have been analysed and compared with the expression of the proteins p21, cyclin D1, cdk4, RB, EGFR, and MDM2 in 53 cancers of the uterine corpus. TP53 gene mutations analysed by CDGE/DGGE and direct sequencing showed a TP53 gene mutation in 18 per cent of the cases. TP53 gene mutations were not significantly related to overexpression or down-regulation of any of the proteins. Immunohistochemically, there was an increased protein level of TP53 in 77 per cent, p21 in 36 per cent, cyclin D1 in 45 per cent, cdk4 in 77 per cent, EGFR in 8 per cent, and MDM2 in 32 per cent of the cases. Expression of RB protein was normal in all cancers. Significant association of protein expression was seen between TP53 and MDM2 (p=0.005) and p21 and MDM2 (p=0.001). Furthermore, there may be an association between TP53 and p21 (p=0. 038) and cyclin D1 and cdk4 (p=0.045). The results revealed increased levels of TP53 protein in all MDM2-positive cases that did not show TP53 mutations, indicating TP53 protein stabilization and inactivation by complex formation with MDM2. In summary, the high number of cases showing an increased level of TP53 and cdk4 proteins suggests that these proteins play an important role in the neoplastic process in cancers of the uterine corpus.

    "Title": "Altered expression of p53 and its regulated proteins in phyllodes tumours of the breast",
    "Abstract": "The histological characteristics of phyllodes tumours of the breast are often not related to their clinical outcome. Additional studies must therefore be performed to investigate the possible relationship of cell biological parameters to the biological behaviour of these tumours. The expression of Ki-67, p53, and its regulated proteins has been studied in 19 primary phyllodes tumours, from patients with known follow-up, using immunohistochemical and molecular biological techniques. Overexpression of the p53 protein was observed in four cases and mutation in two cases. In only one case, the sequence alteration, at codon 273, was associated with overexpression of p53 protein and with strong expression of Ki-67 (30 per cent). This alteration was found in the primary, the recurrent, and the metastatic tumour samples. Moreover, the same p53 gene mutation, Arg273Cys, was detected in all tumour samples. No mutation was found in adjacent normal breast tissue, indicating that this was an acquired mutation. Unexpectedly, strong BAX expression was observed in the primary tumour. The patient died during the follow-up period. It is concluded that p53 gene status and an accumulation of BAX, both involved in the same apoptosis-controlling pathway, may be of prognostic relevance in phyllodes tumours.

    "Title": "Molecular genetic characterization of both components of a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, with implications for its histogenesis [see comments]",
    "Abstract": "Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma is defined as a high-grade, anaplastic sarcoma adjacent to a low-grade malignant cartilage-forming tumour. Controversy remains as to whether the anaplastic and cartilaginous components are derived from a common precursor cell, or whether they represent separate genotypic lineages (collision tumour). Both components of a case of dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma were therefore separately investigated by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), DNA flow cytometry, and p53 analysis. Both showed p53 overexpression and an identical somatic 6 bp deletion in exon 7 of p53. Combination of the CGH and LOH results revealed that both components had lost the same copy of chromosome 13. These results provide compelling evidence in this case for a common origin, instead of the 'collision tumour' theory. Certain genotypic alterations were not shared. The anaplastic component showed severe aneuploidy, LOH at additional loci, and amplification and deletion of several chromosome parts. In contrast, the cartilaginous component had lost chromosomes 5, 22, 17p and part of 16p and revealed an amplification of 17q. The LOH and CGH results further demonstrated that the two components had lost a different copy of chromosome 4. Thus, a substantial number of genetic alterations have occurred after the diversion of the two components, indicating that the separation of the two clones, derived from a single precursor, was a relatively early event in the histogenesis of this case of dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma.

    "Abstract": "We investigated the alterations of the p53, p21, p16, p15 and RAS genes in childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-ALL cell lines by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing. Mutations of the p53 gene were found in three of 57 (5%) patients at diagnosis, one of 14 (7%) patients at relapse and in 12 of 18 (67%) cell lines. In these 12 cell lines, four had more than two mutations of the p53 gene. The p53 mutations were found in four of five cell lines whose original fresh leukemic cells were simultaneously examined original fresh leukemic cells. However, only one of the four fresh leukemic cells had the same mutation. All patients with p53 mutations in the course of disease died. Mutations of the p21 gene were not identified in 71 fresh samples and in 18 cell lines. N-RAS mutations were found in two of 57 (4%) fresh T-ALL patients at diagnosis, and four of 18 cell lines (22%), whereas no mutations were detected in any samples at relapse. Alterations of the p16 gene were found in 18 of 47 (38%) patients at diagnosis and in seven of 14 (50%) at relapse. These differences were not statistically significant. There were no differences in the frequency of alteration of the p16 and p15 genes between event-free patients and the remaining patients. Furthermore, we found the methylation of p16 gene in three of seven patients lacking homozygous deletions, suggesting higher frequency of p16 inactivation than previous reports in T-ALL. Interestingly, we found that one allele is inactivated by methylation and another allele had nonsense mutation in one cell line (KOPT-KI), resulting in loss of protein expression of p16. This type of p16 inactivation has not been so far reported in leukemia. We conclude that, (1) p53 mutations are infrequent at diagnosis but tend to be associated with poor clinical outcome; (2) RAS and p21 mutations may not be involved in the pathogenesis of T-ALL; (3) not only frequent alterations of p16 and p15 genes but also methylation of p16 gene are involved in initiating the leukemogenesis of T-ALLs, and (4) these 5 genes are independently involved in T-ALL",

    "Title": "p53 gene status and chemosensitivity of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to adriamycin",
    "Abstract": "The role of p53 as a determinant of sensitivity of ten childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines to Adriamycin (ADR) was investigated. ADR-sensitive cell lines were found to have wild-type (wt) p53, whereas resistant cell lines contained point mutations in the gene. The basal level of wt p53 protein in sensitive cells was lower than that of mutant p53 in resistant cells, however, after ADR treatment a 6- to 20-fold dose-dependent increase in wt p53 was observed, whereas mutant p53 increased only twofold. The percentage of apoptotic cells in ADR-sensitive lines with wt p53 ranged from 43 to 93% following ADR treatment, whereas that in resistant lines with mutant p53 was only 8-13%. The ratio of constitutive levels of Bax/Bcl- 2 was significantly higher in cells containing wt p53 than in cells with mutant p53. These results suggest that p53 gene status and the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis may be determinants of sensitivity to ADR in childhood ALL cells",

    "Abstract": "A diagnosis of pro-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with CD15+ was made in a 42-year-old woman, 12 months after the treatment of uterine adenocarcinoma by carboplatinum, anthracyclines, etoposide and radiotherapy. Molecular cytogenetic studies revealed a karyotype with multiple chromosome changes, including the t(4;11)(q21;q23) and a 17p- chromosome, with MLL disruption and 17p13/p53 gene deletion in 86% of the cells. A p53 exon 6 mutation was documented, resulting in p53 protein stabilization, with 20% of the cells reacting with the 1801 anti-p53 monoclonal antibody. Dual-color FISH using MLL and p53 probes was performed on peripheral blood smears, providing direct evidence of the involvement of the blast cells and of the granulocytic lineage. Only a partial, shortlasting response was obtained by induction treatment, confirming that a poor prognosis is associated with therapy- related ALL with the 4;11 translocation",

    "Title": "Aberrations of the p53 pathway components p53, MDM2 and CDKN2A appear independent in diffuse large B cell lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "The two gene products of the CDKN2A gene, p16 and p19ARF, have recently been linked to each of two major tumour suppressor pathways in human carcinogenesis, the RB1 pathway and the p53 pathway. p16 inhibits the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product by cyclin D- dependent kinases, whereas p19ARF targets MDM2, a p53 inhibitory protein, for degradation. A deletion of CDKN2A would therefore disturb both pathways. To explore the p53 pathway genes as a functional unit in diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (DLCL), we wanted to see whether there exists mutually exclusiveness of aberrations of CDKN2A, MDM2 and p53, since this has not been analysed previously. We investigated 37 DLCL for aberrations of p15, p16, p19ARF, MDM2, and p53 at the epigenetic, genetic and/or protein levels. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A was detected in seven (19%) of 37 tumours, and another three cases were hypermethylated at the 5' CpG island of p16. No point mutations were found in CDKN2B or CDKN2A. Immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue for p16 confirmed these results, as all tumours with alterations of CDKN2A were p16 immunonegative. We found p53 mutations in eight (22%) cases and MDM2 overexpression in 16 (43%) tumours. Twenty-three (62%) tumours had alterations of one or more p53 pathway components (p53, p19ARF and MDM2). Furthermore, 7/9 (78%) p16-immunonegative tumours showed co- aberration of p53 and/or MDM2. The lack of correlation between these aberrations suggests that DLCL acquire additional growth advantage by inactivating both of these critical regulatory pathways",

    "Title": "Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia with 17p deletion. A report on 25 cases",
    "Abstract": "Two main types of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemias (tAML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (tMDS) have been described. The first classical type typically occurs late after use of alkylating agents and presents as MDS with -7/del 7q and/or -5/del5q. The second form occurs early after the use of agents targeted at topoisomerase II, and presents as AML with 11q23 or other rearrangements of de novo AML. Recently, we and others reported, in AML and MDS, a strong correlation between cytogenetic rearrangements leading to 17p deletion, a specific type of dysgranulopoiesis and p53 mutation; several of those cases of 17p- syndrome were therapy-related. Over the last 15 years, we observed 25 cases of tAML and tMDS with 17p deletion, which represented 36% of the AML and MDS with 17p deletion diagnosed during that period. Median age was 59 years. Twenty-one patients had tMDS and four tAML. Typical dysgranulopoiesis and p53 mutation and/or overexpression were seen in 22 of 24 and 16 of 19 evaluable patients, respectively. 17p deletion resulted from unbalanced translocations involving 17p (18 cases), monosomy 17 (five cases), i(17q) (one case) or del 17p (one case). Twenty-one patients also had -5/del 5q, and/or -7/del 7q. Median interval from treatment of the first tumor of tAML and tMDS was 94 months (range 19-252). Median survival was only 7 months. Based on primary tumor and antineoplastic agents used, patients could be relatively well divided into two groups: a first group of 11 cases, occurring mainly after a lymphoid neoplasm (eight cases) treated by chemotherapy with an alkylating agent (10 cases), and a second group of 14 cases occurring after essential thrombocythemia (ET) or polycythemia vera (PV) treated mainly by hydroxyurea (10 cases), pipobroman (eight cases), 32P (six cases) but rarely by alkylating agents (two cases). - 7/del 7q was found in 10 of the 11 patients in the first group, as compared to three of the 14 patients of the second group (P = 0.0001). Therefore, therapy-related cases represent a high proportion of AML and MDS with the 17p- syndrome. They have many features in common with classical tMDS and tAML, including long interval from the first tumor, a usual preleukemic phase, and frequent occurrence of -5/del 5q. About one half of them, in addition, occur after alkylating agents and generally carry -7/del 7q. The other half, however, occur mainly after ET or PV treated by hydroxyurea or other non-alkylating agents, and usually have no -7/del 7q. These findings bring further support to a possible relationship between prior drugs used and cytogenetic rearrangements in tAML and tMDS",

    "Title": "Distinct genetic involvement of the TP53 gene in therapy-related leukemia and myelodysplasia with chromosomal losses of Nos 5 and/or 7 and its possible relationship to replication error phenotype",
    "Abstract": "We examined chromosomes and molecular aberrations in 21 patients with therapy-related leukemias (t-AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (t-MDS). All patients showed abnormal karyotypes, and chromosomal losses of No. 5 and/or No. 7 (-5/5q- and/or -7/7q-) were identified in 12 patients. Among these 12, six patients (50%) harbored a TP53 mutation, and two of five examined showed microsatellite instability, suggesting replication error (RER+) phenotype. Meanwhile, among the other nine patients without -5/5q- and/or -7/7q-, none harbored a TP53 mutation, and none of five examined showed RER+ phenotype. Thus, TP53 mutations and RER+ phenotype were preferentially associated with specific chromosomal losses in t-AML/MDS. We then screened for mutational events in representative DNA mismatch repair genes; exons 5-7 and 12-15 of the hMSH2 gene and exon 9 of hMLH1. Notably, two unrelated patients showing RER+ phenotype had an identical missense alteration at codon 419 of hMSH2 in their marrow cells and fibroblasts, which were not found in 120 DNA samples from healthy volunteers or patients with other hematological disorders. Consequently, this study revealed a possible relationship of RER+ phenotype accompanying an hMSH2 alteration to the development of therapy-related AML/MDS in association with TP53 mutations and specific chromosomal losses, and suggests that some patients may be predisposed to myelodysplasia after chemotherapy for their primary tumor",

    "Title": "Comparative molecular genetic profiles of anaplastic astrocytomas/glioblastomas multiforme and their subsequent recurrences",
    "Abstract": "Malignant glial tumors (anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas multiforme) arise mostly either from the progression of low grade precursor lesions or rapidly in a de novo fashion and contain distinct genetic alterations. There is, however, a third subset of malignant gliomas in which genetic lesions remain to be identified. Following surgical resection, all gliomas appear to have an inherent tendency to recur. Comparative molecular analysis of ten primary malignant gliomas (three anaplastic astrocytomas and seven glioblastomas multiforme) with their recurrences identified two distinct subgroups of recurrent tumors. In one group, primary tumors harbored genetic aberrations frequently associated with linear progression or de novo formation pathways of glial tumorigenesis and maintained their genetic profiles upon recurrence. In the other subset with no detectable known genetic mutations at first presentation, the recurrent tumors sustained specific abnormalities associated with pathways of linear progression or de novo formation. These included loss of genes on chromosomes 17 and 10, mutations in the p53 gene, homozygous deletion of the DMBTA1 and p16 and/ or p15 genes and amplification and/or overexpression of CDK4 and alpha form of the PDGF receptor. Recurrent tumors from both groups also displayed an abnormal expression profile of the metalloproteinase, gel A, and its inhibitor, TIMP-2, consistent with their highly invasive behavior. Delineation of the molecular differences between malignant glioblastomas and their subsequent recurrences may have important implications for the development of rational clinical approaches for this neoplasm that remains refractory to existing therapeutic modalities",

    "Abstract": "The association of p53 abnormalities with the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) has been extensively investigated to date, however, this association is still controversial. Therefore, we investigated the prognostic significance of p53 mutations through exons 2 to 11 and p53 protein expression in 103 cases of stage I NSCLC. p53 mutations were detected in 49 of 103 (48%) tumors. Two separate mutations were detected in four tumors giving a total of 53 unique mutations in 49 tumors. Ten (19%) of mutations occurred outside exons 5-8. Positive immunohistochemical staining of p53 protein was detected in 41 of 103 (40%) tumors. The concordance rate between mutations and protein overexpression was only 69%. p53 mutations, but not expression, were significantly associated with a shortened survival of patients (P<0.001). Furthermore, we investigated the correlation between the types of p53 mutations and prognosis. p53 missense mutations rather than null mutations were associated with poor prognosis (P < 0.001 in missense mutations and P=0.243 in null mutations). These results indicated that p53 mutations, in particular missense mutations, rather than p53 expression could be a useful molecular marker for the prognosis of patients with surgically resected stage I NSCLC",

    "Title": "P16 UV mutations in human skin epithelial tumors",
    "Abstract": "The p16 gene expresses two alternative transcripts (p16alpha and p16beta) involved in tumor suppression via the retinoblastoma (Rb) or p53 pathways. Disruption of these pathways can occur through inactivation of p16 or p53, or activating mutations of cyclin dependant kinase 4 gene (Cdk4). We searched for p16, Cdk4 and p53 gene mutations in 20 squamous cell carcinomas (SSCs), 1 actinic keratosis (AK), and 28 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), using PCR-SSCP. A deletion and methylation analysis of p16 was also performed. Six different mutations (12%) were detected in exon 2 of p16 (common to p16alpha and p16beta), in five out of 21 squamous lesions (24%) (one AK and four SCCs) and one out of 28 BCCs (3.5%). These included four (66%) ultraviolet (UV)-type mutations (two tandems CC : GG to TT : AA transitions and two C : G to T : A transitions at dipyrimidic site) and two transversions. P53 mutations were present in 18 samples (37%), mostly of UV type. Of these, only two (one BCC and one AK) harboured simultaneously mutations of p16, but with no consequence on p16beta transcript. Our data demonstrate for the first time the presence of p16 UV induced mutations in non melanoma skin cancer, particularly in the most aggressive SCC type, and support that p16 and p53 are involved in two independent pathways in skin carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Inactivation of the INK4A/ARF locus frequently coexists with TP53 mutations in non-small cell lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "Inactivation of the P16 (INK4A)/retinoblastoma (RB) or TP53 biochemical pathway is frequent event in most human cancers. Recent evidence has shown that P14ARF binds to MDM2 leading to an increased availability of wild type TP53 protein. Functional studies also support a putative tumor suppressor gene function for p14ARF suggesting that p14ARF or p53 inactivation may be functionally equivalent in tumorigenesis. To study the relative contribution of each pathway in tumorigenesis, we analysed and compared alterations of the p16, p14ARF and p53 genes in 38 primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (19 adenocarcinomas and 19 squamous carcinoma). The p16 tumor suppressor gene was inactivated in 22 of 38 (58%) tumors. Twelve of these samples (31%) had homozygous deletions by microsatellite analysis; eight of them (21%) had p16 promoter hypermethylation detected by Methylation Specific PCR (MSP) and the remaining two (5%) harbored a point mutation in exon 2 by sequence analysis. The absence of P16 protein in every case was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Fourteen of the 22 tumors with p16 inactivation also inactivated the p14ARF gene (12 with homozygous deletions extending into INK4a/ARF and two with exon 2 mutations). Mutations of p53 were found in 18 (47%) of the tumors and nine of them (50%) harbored p14ARF inactivation. Thus, an inverse correlation was not found between p14ARF and p53 genetic alterations (P=0.18; Fisher Exact Test). Our data confirm that the p16 gene is frequently inactivated in NSCLC. Assuming that 9p deletion occurs first, the common occurrence of p53 and p14ARF alterations suggests that p14ARF inactivation is not functionally equivalent to abrogation of the TP53 pathway by p53 mutation",

    "Title": "Cells with TP53 mutations in low grade astrocytic tumors evolve clonally to malignancy and are an unfavorable prognostic factor",
    "Abstract": "It is important to understand how low grade tumors recur and progress to malignant lesions since this dramatically shortens patient survival. Here, we evaluated the concept that malignant progression and poor prognosis of low grade astrocytic tumors are TP53 dependent through clonal expansion of mutated cells. TP53 status was established in primary and recurrent tumors from 36 patients with WHO grade II astrocytic tumors and two tumor types were found. Tumors from 14 patients (39%; type 1) had TP53 mutated cells, and 92% of these recurred with 57% progressing to malignancy. The evolution of TP53 mutated cells before and after progression was examined using a clonal analysis procedure in yeast. Malignant progression was accompanied by an increased percentage of mutant TP53 (red) yeast colonies resulting from monoclonal expansion of cells with mutated TP53. The presence of TP53 mutations in WHO grade II astrocytic tumors was associated with malignant progression (P=0. 034, chi2 test) and shorter progression- free survival (PFS; 47.6+/-9. 6 months for TP53-mutated tumors vs 67.8+/-8.2 months for TP53-wild type tumors, P<0.05, log-rank test). Tumors from 22 patients (61%; type 2) were without TP53 mutations, and 64% of these recurred without a change in TP53 status, although 41% progressed to malignancy. This suggests that TP53 mutation is not an initiating or progression event in the majority of low grade astrocytic tumors. Our study also indicates that irradiation for WHO grade II astrocytic tumors might be associated with poor outcome (P<0.0001) and this was independent of TP53 status. These findings have important implications in the clinical management of patients with low grade astocytoma and provide new support to the clonal evolution model for tumor progression",

We have investigated two hypotheses: (a) p73 is mutated in diverse types of human cancer, and (b) p73 is functionally redundant with p53 in carcinogenesis so that mutations would be exclusive in these two genes. The entire coding region and intronic splice junctions of p73 were examined in 54 cancer cell lines. Three lung cancer cell lines contained mutations that affected the amino acid sequence. One amino acid substitution was in a region with homology to the specific DNA binding region of p53 and two microdeletions were outside the region of homology. Two of the cell lines with p73 mutations also carried p53 mutations. Although our results are inconsistent with the two hypotheses tested, p73 mutations may contribute infrequently to the molecular pathogenesis of human lung cancer",

Pancreatic juice was collected endoscopically from 12 patients with IPMT who underwent surgical resection (eight carcinomas and four adenomas) and eight cases without evident pancreatic diseases. DNA was extracted and both genes were examined by polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing. In addition, surgically resected specimens were analyzed for both genes by the same methods, and p53 overexpression was investigated immunohistochemically. K-ras point mutations were detected in pancreatic juice from all 12 patients (100%) and p53 mutations were detected in five of 12 (42%). They were detected not only in carcinoma but also in adenoma and there was no difference between the mutations detected in pancreatic juice and surgical specimens. No mutations were found in any cases without pancreatic diseases. These findings suggest that alterations of K-ras and p53 gene are common events in the development of IPMT and that genetic analysis of them in pancreatic juice can be a useful tool for the clinical diagnosis of IPMT before surgery",

    "Title": "Structural alteration of p53 protein correlated to survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene represent the most common form of genetic alterations found in diverse types of human cancer. The majority of the mutations occur in the core domain, which contains the sequence-specific DNA-binding site. They may result in loss of DNA binding and disability of transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell-cycle regulation. Analysis of the protein-structure model of these mutations can provide clues to the function of specific regions of p53 and to the clinical significance of p53 mutation. We examined 68 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma for p53 mutation and mutant protein- structure model by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), PCR-DNA sequencing, and computer-generated protein modeling. Twenty (29.41%) of 68 cases showed p53 mutation. Statistical analysis showed there was no significant difference in survival between p53 mutation and wild-type p53 (median survival, 12 vs. 13 months; p = 0.2034). Among p53 mutations, nine mutations were located at or near the DNA-binding site, and the protein structures of the DNA-binding site were changed. Patients in this group had a shorter median survival compared with those with mutation far from the DNA-binding site (median survival, 5 vs. 15 months; p = 0.0435). We conclude that detecting and modeling the p53 gene mutation may be used as a tool in predicting the clinical course of patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The p53 gene alteration is identified in approximately half of all human tumors, and is now thought to be a key gene for regulating the cell cycle through the induction of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and inducing apoptosis through some genes such as BAX. In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of p53 mutation for postoperative esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients. METHODS: The subjects studied were 42 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients who underwent esophagectomy with complete curability in our department. The cases were limited to stage II and III. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues. A p53 gene mutation was detected by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and subsequent direct sequencing method for exons 5 to 9. The 5-year survival rate was calculated and statistically compared between the p53 mutation(+) and (-) groups by the log rank test. RESULTS: The p53 gene mutation was identified in 14 cases (33.3%). The 5-year survival rate of the p53 mutation(-) group (n = 28) was significantly higher than the (+) group (n = 14; 51.0% versus 35.7%, P <0.05 by the log rank test). Recurrence could be identified in 10 of 14 p53 mutation(+) cases (71.4%), whereas it was found in 12 of 28 (-) cases (42.8%). CONCLUSION: The current study indicated that p53 mutation of tumor tissues might be a prognostic factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases and one of the risk factors for its recurrence",

Initial p53 mutation screening of blast cells from 29 patients with acute leukaemia by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that 2 had a silent codon 213 polymorphism and only the index case had a somatic mutation identified to be an 8 bp insertion in codon 281 (5'CCGGGGGG- 3'). This insertion was associated with the second, more aggressive clone which underwent clonal evolution and became resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy. With an allele-specific primer in PCR, we were able to demonstrate the presence of this clone as a minority at disease presentation, and in 2 of 3 collections of peripheral blood progenitor cells",

    "Title": "A novel 23-bp deletion in exon 5 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene",
    "Abstract": "We report a novel p53 deletion in a 63-year-old female with breast cancer. Mutation screening of DNA samples, obtained from tumor specimens from 98 individuals with breast cancer, by a combined polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR- SSCP) analysis showed that the index case had a somatic mutation identified to be a 23-bp deletion in exon 5 of the p53 gene. This deletion would be expected to yield a truncated and functionally inactive p53 protein molecule, probably resulting in cell transformation. The existence of 6-bp palindromic-like sequences encompassing the deleted fragment suggests that the slipped mispairing mechanism is not involved in producing the deletion, which probably resulted from palindromic pairing during replication",

    "Title": "Relationship of p53 mutations to epidermal cell proliferation and apoptosis in human UV-induced skin carcinogenesis",
    "Abstract": "Human skin is continually subjected to UV-irradiation with the p53 gene playing a pivotal role in repair of UV-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. Consequently, p53 alterations are early events in human UV- induced skin carcinogenesis. We studied 13 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 16 actinic keratoses (AK), 13 samples adjacent to an AK (chronically sun-damaged), and 14 normal-appearing skin samples for p53 mutation, p53 immunostaining (IHC), apoptosis (in situ TUNEL and morphology), and proliferation (PCNA). The frequency of p53 mutation increased from 14% in normal skin, to 38.5% in sun-damaged skin, 63% in AK, and 54% in SCC. p53 IHC increased similarly. Apoptosis (TUNEL) increased from 0.06 +/- 0.02%, to 0.1 +/- 0.2, 0.3 +/- 0.3, and 0.4 +/- 0.3 in normal skin, sun-damaged skin, AK, and SCC, respectively. Apoptosis was strongly correlated with proliferation (i.e., TUNEL and PCNA, r = 0.7, P < 0.0001), and proliferation was significantly increased in the progression from normal skin to SCC. Bax was significantly increased in SCC compared to AK. These data imply that apoptosis in samples with a high frequency of p53 mutation may not necessarily be p53-dependent. We suggest that there is a mechanism for apoptosis in response to increased cellular proliferation that is p53- independent",

    "Title": "Infrequent alteration of p53 pathway in metastatic renal cell carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) is known to be highly resistant to conventional chemotherapy and irradiation suggesting that RCC cells do not easily undergo apoptosis, though p53 mutation is an infrequent event in RCC. p53 is responsible for the expression of p21WAF1 and bax genes, and these expressions are involved in the G1 arrest or apoptosis when cells are exposed to genotoxic stimuli. These gene mutations have been detected and their dysfunction may lead to accumulation of genomic alterations. We investigated the p53, p21WAF1 and bax gene mutations in 5 patients who had primary RCC and metastatic tumors. In one case only the metastatic tumor had non-sense transversion in the p53 gene, whereas the primary tumor showed no p53 gene mutation. no p21WAF1 and bax mutations were detected in any primary RCC or metastatic tumors. These findings suggest that, in RCC, inactivation of p53 might contribute to progression of the disease but inactivation of p21WAF1 and bax are not likely to play significant roles in the defective p53 pathway",

    "Title": "Distinct molecular pathogeneses of early-onset breast cancers in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers: a population-based study",
    "Abstract": "Breast cancers arising in women with and without a germline mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene display different histological features, which suggests unique mechanisms of molecular pathogenesis: We used a molecular pathological analysis to define the genetic abnormalities relevant to these specific pathogeneses. Tumor material was studied from 40 women with breast cancer diagnosed before 40 years of age, sampled from a population-based study and stratified by BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation status. Cases were not selected for family history or ethnic origin, and none were known to be genetically related. Thus, germline mutation itself is likely to impact on the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors, with no substantial influence due to modifying genetic or environmental factors. Breast cancers occurring in BRCA1 mutation carriers had significantly higher levels of p53 expression, including the preinvasive (carcinoma in situ) stage of disease, compared with cancers occurring in BRCA2 mutation carriers or women with no detectable germline mutation. These cancers also had a higher proliferation rate as measured by Ki-67 antibody. Expression of the prognostic factors c-erbB-2, cyclin D1, and estrogen receptor was significantly less common in BRCA1 mutation carriers. Lower levels of cyclin D1 were also found in cancers from BRCA2 mutation carriers compared with non-mutation carriers. Direct p53 mutation analysis revealed mutations in 18% of all of the early-onset breast cancers within the study and included rare insertion and deletional mutations in cancers from BRCA1 mutation carriers. Our data indicate that a BRCA1 breast cancer phenotype may be recognized by an exceptionally high proliferation rate and early and frequent p53 overexpression but infrequent selection for overexpression of several other prognostic factor proteins known to be involved in breast oncogenesis. In contrast, breast cancers arising in BRCA2 mutation carriers have a more heterogeneous phenotypic profile",

    "Title": "Specific p53 gene mutations in urinary bladder epithelium after the Chernobyl accident",
    "Abstract": "After the Chernobyl accident, the incidence of urinary bladder cancers in the Ukraine population increased gradually from 26.2 to 36.1 per 100,000 between 1986 and 1996. Urinary bladder epithelium biopsied from 45 male patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia living in radiocontaminated areas of Ukraine demonstrated frequent severe urothelial dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, and a single invasive transitional cell carcinoma, combined with irradiation cystitis in 42 cases (93%). No neoplastic changes (carcinoma in situ or transitional cell carcinoma) were found in 10 patients from clean areas (areas without radiocontamination). DNA was extracted from the altered urothelium of selected paraffin-embedded specimens that showed obviously abnormal histology (3 cases) or intense p53 immunoreactivity (15 cases), and mutational analysis of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene was performed by PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis followed by DNA sequencing. Nine of 17 patients (53%) had one or more mutations in the altered urothelium. Urine sediment samples were also collected from the patients at 4-27 months after biopsy and analyzed by PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis or yeast functional assay, and identical or additional p53 mutations were found in four of five cases. Interestingly, a relative hot spot at codon 245 was found in five of nine (56%) cases with mutations, and 11 of the 13 mutations determined (73%) were G:C to A:T transitions at CpG dinucleotides, reported to be relatively infrequent (approximately 18%) in human urinary bladder cancers. Therefore, the frequent and specific p53 mutations found in these male patients may alert us to a future elevated occurrence of urinary bladder cancers in the radiocontaminated areas",

    "Title": "Gender differences in p53 mutational status in small cell lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been demonstrated to be one of the most frequent genetic abnormalities in human cancers. Previous studies have shown that the frequency of p53 mutations is significantly higher in small cell lung cancer than in non-small cell lung cancer. However, this conclusion was based in large part on data derived from tumor cell lines and from studies with relatively small sample sizes and biased gender populations. To determine the mutational frequency in the p53 tumor suppressor gene and a potential difference in gender, we analyzed primary small cell lung cancer tumors from 65 patients (37 males and 28 females) for p53 mutations between exons 5 and 9. Mutations were found in 37 of 65 tumors (57%) within the region of p53 analyzed. Interestingly, none of the tumors from females contained more than one mutation, whereas four of the tumors from males contained more than one mutation. The most common mutation in this population was an adenosine-to-guanine transition (27%), followed by guanine-to-thymidine transversion (17%) and guanine-to-adenosine transition (12%). The gender difference in p53 mutational rate identified in this study suggests that a higher proportion of female tumors may develop through pathways not involving p53 mutations",

We evaluated 213 mapped, flow-purified, endoscopic biopsies to determine the distribution of p53-mutant clones in the Barrett's segments of 58 patients who had high-grade dysplasia without cancer. Twenty-nine patients (50%) had p53 mutations in their Barrett's segments, including 3 patients with multiple distinct p53 mutations. p53-mutant clones, including diploid cell populations, underwent expansion from 1 to 9 cm in the Barrett's segment. In 12 of 29 patients (41%) with a p53 mutation, the same mutation was found at every evaluated level of the metaplastic epithelium.

    "Title": "p53 null mutations undetected by immunohistochemical staining predict a poor outcome with early-stage non-small cell lung carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "The importance of p53 mutations in the pathogenesis of human lung carcinoma is well established, but it is still controversial whether the presence of p53 mutations or overexpression of p53 protein adversely affects an individual patient's chances of survival. The controversy may be partially due to the methodological differences in examination for p53 alterations: gene analysis or immunohistochemical staining. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that different types of mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene confer different biological properties. To clarify the relationship between immunohistochemical staining and prognosis, we investigated mutations using single-strand conformation polymorphism followed by sequencing for exons 4-8 and 10 in 144 surgically treated non-small cell lung carcinoma patients with intensive clinical follow-up. Of 144 cases, 107 adenocarcinomas were examined for immunohistochemical staining with RSP53 antibody. p53 gene mutations were observed in 65 tumors (45%), including 44 missense and 21 null mutations, the latter comprising 7 nonsense mutations, 8 deletions, 2 insertions, and 4 splicing junction mutations. Presence of p53 mutations was an independent prognostic factor with a statistical trend (P = 0.14) in stage I patients but not in all cases. When examined by mutational pattern, null mutation was a significant indicator of poor outcome by multivariate analysis (P = 0.03) in stage I patients, whereas cases with missense mutations and without mutations did not differ (P = 0.76). Forty (37%) tumors demonstrated overexpression of the p53 protein but without any survival difference. Most tumors (76%) with missense mutations were immunopositive, but those with null mutations with one exception (93%) were not, and the concordance between the mutations and immunohistochemical staining was rather low at 65%. These data suggest that the type of p53 mutation is important for prediction of outcome in early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma patients, whereas immunohistochemical staining for abnormal p53 gene products is nonpredictive. Furthermore, null mutations causing loss of function of the gene product may play more important roles than missense mutations in tumor progression",

    "Title": "Genetic alterations in pediatric high-grade astrocytomas",
    "Abstract": "High-grade astrocytomas are tumors that are uncommon in children. Relatively few studies have been performed on their molecular properties and so it is not certain whether they follow different genetic pathways from those described in adult diffuse astrocytomas. In this study, we evaluated 24 pediatric high-grade astrocytomas (11 anaplastic astrocytomas and 13 glioblastomas) all of which were sporadic and primary. We studied mutations of p53, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosomes 17p13, 9p21 and 10q23-25, amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and overexpression of EGFR and p53 protein. In addition, we searched for microsatellite instability (MSI) by using MSI sensitive and specific microsatellite markers. p53 mutations were found in 38% (9/24) of the high-grade astrocytomas and all brain stem tumors except 2 (71%, 5/7) had p53 mutations. PTEN mutations were found in 8% (2/24) of high-grade astrocytomas. However, no EGFR amplification was found in any of them. LOH was found at 17p13.1 in 50% (3/6 informative tumors), 9p21 in 83% (5/6 informative tumors), and 10q23-25 in 78% (7/9 informative tumors). Four tumors showed MSI, and 2 of them that showed widespread MSI were regarded as tumors with replication error (RER+) phenotype. All 4 tumors with MSI showed concurrent LOH of 9p21 and 10q23-25. Combining gene alterations, LOH, MSI, and gene mutations, inactivation of both alleles of PTEN and p53 was found in 57% (4/7 informative tumors) and 50% (3/6 informative tumors) of the cases respectively. We conclude that development of pediatric high-grade astrocytomas may follow pathways different from the primary or secondary paradigm of adult glioblastomas. In a subset of these tumors, genomic instability was also implicated",

    "Title": "Molecular abnormalities associated with secretory carcinomas of the breast",
    "Abstract": "Secretory carcinomas (SCAs) represent a unique histological variant of invasive breast carcinomas, occurring predominantly in patients younger than 30 years of age. Data from limited series have shown SCAs to have a favorable prognosis in patients younger than 20 years of age, whereas the clinical course tends to parallel the more common in filtrating ductal carcinomas (IDCs) in patients older than 20 years. There are no reports on the molecular abnormalities associated with this unusual tumor. Microdissected archival formalin-fixed tissue from 10 SCAs collected from 2 institutions were used to determine the frequencies of allelic loss at 13 chromosomal regions with 19 microsatellite markers, using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques. The results of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite alterations (MAs) analyses were compared with 20 cases of IDCs. P53 gene mutation analysis was also performed on the 10 SCAs using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, followed by sequencing of abnormal bands. LOH at multiple regions of chromosome 3p were the most common abnormality in both SCAs (55%) and IDCs (50%), followed by LOH at 17q21 (BRCA1 locus), 13q14 (retinoblastoma gene locus), and 8p21-23. No significant differences were seen in the frequencies of LOH at any chromosomal region except for 17p13 (p53 gene locus), where allelic losses were absent in SCAs, but evident in 46% of IDCs (P < .05). The 2 histological entities were similar in the fractional regional loss (FRL) index (0.26 v 0.24), fractional allelic loss (FAL) index (0.23 v 0.27), as well as in the frequency of MAs (0.015 v 0.005), P > .05. P53 gene missense mutation (G:C::A:T) was detected in 1 of 10(10%) SCAs. Based on the considerable similarities in the molecular abnormalities associated with both tumors, the formation of secondary lumina in both the in situ and the invasive components, as well as suggestions from limited series that the clinical behavior in adult patients parallels that of IDCs, SCA most likely reflects a secretory variant of IDCs",

    "Title": "Sequencing analysis of RNA and DNA of exons 1 through 11 shows p53 gene alterations to be present in almost 100% of head and neck squamous cell cancers",
    "Abstract": "Data on p53 alterations in human cancers are mainly based on studies restricted to the core domain (exons 5-9), because mutations outside this region are assumed to be rare. To test this assumption, we studied 25 consecutive patients with primary, untreated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with a p53 mutation analysis strategy that consists of sequencing all 11 p53 exons and the complete p53 mRNA. With this method, we encountered p53 mutations in 91% of patients; 33% of these were located outside the core domain. Overexpression of the p53 protein was assessed with staining with antibody Bp 53-12-1. Protein overexpression was found in 64%. In one case, p53 overexpression occurred without p53 gene mutations. Analysis of tumor tissue from two autopsied patients with multiple lesions in the head and neck and at distant sites allowed analysis of the clonal relationship of the different tumor foci. In one patient, the head and neck lesion had a mutation different from the one observed at the distant sites, suggesting two different primary tumors, one of them leading to widespread metastastic disease. In all lesions from the second patient, the same mutation was found, suggesting one primary that had metastatized. It appears that sequencing of all exons of the p53 gene is vital for assessment of the real incidence of p53 mutations in HNSCC, because 33% of all mutations are located outside the core domain, leading to a mutation frequency of almost 100% in HNSCC. In 96% of cases, either presence or absence of p53 protein expression could be explained by the type of p53 gene mutation. When only analyzing the p53 core domain, the incidence of p53 mutations in HNSCC is underestimated",

    "Abstract": "Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most common malignant tumor in liver; however, the carcinogenic mechanism of ICC is poorly understood. To analyze the molecular carcinogenesis of ICC, we examined the alterations of the p53, APC, and K-ras genes in 40 surgically resected ICC cases. The single-strand conformation polymorphism/sequencing revealed a p53 mutation in 12 cases (30%). An immunohistochemical overexpression of the p53 gene was detected in 10 cases (25%). The PCR/RFLP showed loss of heterozygosity of APC in 4 of 17 informative cases (23.5%). And the PCR/RFLP assay of K-ras codon 12 revealed the mutation in nine cases (22.5%). Twenty-one cases (52.5%) showed an alteration of at least one of the examined genes, and six (15%) carried an abnormality in more than two genes. The analysis of the clinicopathologic findings disclosed a significant relationship between the genetic alteration and gross type of the tumor: the p53 mutation was prominent in the ICC of mass-forming type, and K-ras mutation occurred more frequently in the ICC of periductal extension type (p < 0.05). These data suggest that each of the examined genes is involved in the development of ICC and that the p53 and K-ras mutation may play a role in the tumor growth pattern",

    "Title": "mdm-2 expression correlates with wild-type p53 status in esophageal adenocarcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Several immunohistochemical studies showed that p53 protein is expressed in 50 to 80% of esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAs). Mutations of this tumor suppressor gene are present in 40 to 70% of EAs, so it is possible that p53 expression might occur as a result of mechanisms other than gene mutation. The human homologue of the murine double minute-2 gene (mdm-2) is a known regulator of p53 activity, and its expression results in stabilization of the wild-type p53 protein and loss of its tumor suppressor function. In this study, we evaluated the frequency of mdm-2 amplification and expression in EA and investigated the relationship between mdm-2 expression and p53 mutation. Thirty- three resection specimens of EAs and associated Barrett's esophagus were evaluated by immunohistochemical methods for p53 and mdm-2 expression. Sixteen of these cases were also evaluated for p53 mutations with use of polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformational polymorphism, and DNA sequencing and for mdm-2 amplification with a differential polymerase chain reaction-based amplification analysis. Overexpression of p53 was present in 23 EAs (70%), and 18 EAs (55%) overexpressed mdm-2. p53 mutation was observed in 7 (43%) of 16 cases, whereas mdm-2 gene amplification was not detected in any. To summarize, we found substantial discordance of p53 immunohistochemical features and mutation in EA. Significant expression of mdm-2 occurred only in cases with wild-type p53, whereas all of the cases with p53 mutation showed little if any expression of mdm-2. Also, mdm-2 expression in cases with p53 overexpression but without p53 mutation exceeded mdm-2 expression in cases with p53 overexpression and p53 gene mutation. In cases without p53 mutation, overexpression of mdm- 2 occurred in 50% of cases and might be responsible for stabilization of p53 protein and possible loss of tumor suppressor function",

    "Abstract": "AIM: To compare the frequency and type of p53 alterations (gene mutation and/or protein overexpression) in a consecutive series of surgically resected adenocarcinomas arising in the gastric cardia and gastric antrum, and to evaluate associations with clinicopathological findings (age, sex, and tumour histology, grade, and stage). METHODS: The series comprised 50 patients with adenocarcinoma of the cardia and 20 patients with adenocarcinoma of the antrum. p53 gene mutations (exons 5-8) were detected by denaturing gradient gel analysis and DNA sequencing. Nuclear p53 overexpression was detected by immunohistochemistry with the DO7 antibody. RESULTS: p53 gene mutations were found in 21 of 50 and five of 20 adenocarcinomas of the cardia and the antrum, respectively. Base transitions occurring at CpG dinucleotides were frequent in both types of tumour. p53 protein overexpression was seen in 32 of 50 and seven of 20 adenocarcinomas of the cardia and of the antrum, respectively. p53 gene mutation and/or protein overexpression were significantly more frequent in adenocarcinomas of the cardia (37 of 50) than in adenocarcinomas of the antrum (seven of 20). There were no differences in the clinicopathological characteristics of the tumours between p53 positive and p53 negative cases in both types of cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that p53 alterations are more frequent in adenocarcinoma of the cardia than in adenocarcinoma of the antrum. This feature is consistent with the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these cancers, which suggest that adenocarcinoma arising in the gastric cardia might be related to oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and unrelated to adenocarcinomas of the gastric body and antrum",

    "Abstract": "The inactivation of p53 tumour suppressor gene vis-a-vis point mutation, overexpression and degradation due to Human Papilloma virus (HPV) 16/18 infection, was examined in chewing tobacco-associated oral cancers and oral leukoplakias from India. The analysis of mutations was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) of exons 5-9 on DNA from 83 oral cancer cases, and the mutations confirmed by direct nucleotide sequencing of the PCR products. p53 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis on paraffin-embedded sections of 62 representative oral cancer biopsies and 22 leukoplakias, using p53- specific monoclonal antibody DO-7. The presence of HPV16/18 was detected in the 83 oral cancer cases by PCR analysis using HPV L1 consensus sequences, followed by Southern hybridization with type- specific oligonucleotide probes. Forty-six per cent (38/83) of oral cancer tumours showed p53 alterations, with 17% (14/83) showing point mutations, 37% (23/62) with overexpression and 25% (21/83) with presence of HPV16 wherein the E6 HPV16 protein degrades p53. HPV18 was not detected in any of the samples. Ninety-two per cent concordance was observed between missense point mutations and overexpression of p53 protein. A significant correlation was not observed between p53 alterations in oral cancer and clinico-pathological profile of the patients. Twenty-seven per cent (6/22) of oral leukoplakias showed p53 overexpression. The overall p53 alterations in oral cancer tissues and oral lesions are comparable to data from the oral cancers reported in the Western countries with smoking and alcohol-associated oral cancers, and suggest a critical role for p53 gene in a significant proportion of oral cancers from India. The overexpression of p53 protein in leukoplakias may serve as a valuable biomarker for identifying individuals at high risk of transformation to malignant phenotype",

    "Title": "New insights into p53 protein stabilisation in oral squamous cell carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "p53 is a transcription factor which regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis to prevent division of potentially malignant cells. In many tumours mutation of the p53 gene leads to stabilisation of this protein which can be detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, there are many reports describing detection of p53 by IHC in the absence of gene mutation, and in these cases other factors stabilise p53. To shed light on the mechanisms which permit detection of this protein in these mutation-negative cases we have examined 45 primary oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) by IHC and gene sequencing for p53 (exons 4-8) and related the results to a FAL score (determined using microsatellite assay and expressing the number of loci showing allelic imbalance as a fraction of the total number of informative markers for each case). We also investigated the pattern of MDM2 expression in these tumours. High levels of p53 protein were detected in 24/45 cases and point mutations involving exons 4-9 were seen in 11 cases. A further four cases harboured deletions or a stop codon. For 6/48 cases there was concordance of AI within the p53 gene and mutation. However nine cases showed p53 mutation only and 5 AI without mutation, suggesting that oral tumours frequently retain one normal p53 allele. Detection of p53 by IHC correlated strongly with the FAL score. Thus whilst it is possible that some tumours harbour p53 mutations outside the open reading frames examined, or are missed due to sequencing a mixture of normal and tumour tissue, a subgroup of tumours may express high levels of wild-type p53 as a reflection of the high FAL score and ongoing genomic stress. Levels of MDM2 transcripts and protein were similar in all SCCs examined. However, MDM2 may be non-functional, or there may be defects affecting other important regulatory proteins in tumours which which express wild type p53 protein",

    "Title": "p53 tumor suppressor gene as a clonal marker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: p53 mutations in primary tumor and matched lymph node metastases",
    "Abstract": "In order to define the diagnostic value of p53 tumor suppressor gene as a clonal marker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), we investigated p53 mutations in primary tumors (PT) and matched lymph node metastases (LNM); the underlying question being whether differentiation between metastatic disease of a known PT or (a metastasis of) a synchronous or metachronous second tumor is possible by means of p53 sequencing-based mutation analysis. In 15 PT, the p53 status was analyzed, following RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and polymerase chain reaction amplification, by direct sequencing full- length mRNA. Mutations thus found were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis of the corresponding exon in the PT. When RNA isolation was defective, DNA sequencing analysis of exons 1 through 11 was performed. In the matched LNM, DNA analysis of the corresponding exon was performed to prove the presence of the same p53 mutation. In the event of small clones not detectable by direct sequencing, an oligo ligation assay was developed to detect a specific mutation. The presence of germline mutations was excluded by DNA sequencing analysis of the corresponding exon of peripheral blood leucocytes. In 14 PT (94%), a mutation was identified. In one PT, no p53 mutation could be identified either after full-length mRNA sequencing or after sequencing exons 1 through 11. In all cases of PT and matched LNM, the mutations proved to be identical. We conclude that p53 mutations develop in carcinogenesis before metastases occur and are maintained during metastasis. Consequently, p53 may serve as a clonal marker not susceptible to change during tumor metastasis. This merits further exploration of the application of p53 mutation analysis in differentiating between metastatic disease from a known PT versus a metastasis of another second PT",

    "Abstract": "To evaluate whether it is useful for diagnosis to detect K-ras and p53 mutations in biopsy specimens and bile of biliary tract lesions, 12 cholangiocarcinomas (CC), eight cases of cholangitis, seven gallbladder carcinomas (GBC), seven gallbladder cholesterol polyps, four cases of adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder and five cases of cholecystitis were examined. K-ras and p53 mutations in bile were detected by a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. In addition, p53 protein expression in biopsy specimens from CC were examined by immunostaining. K-ras mutations at codon 12 were detected in 50% of CC and 57.1% of GBC in both biopsy specimens and bile. The incidence of p53 mutations was 33.3% in CC and 42.9% in GBC. p53 protein overexpression was observed in 60% CC biopsy specimens. In contrast, K-ras and p53 abnormalities were not detected in any non-neoplastic biliary tract lesion. K-ras and p53 mutations in biliary tract cancers showed the same mutation patterns in spite of differences in the collection methods used between bile and biopsy specimens or surgically resected tissue. Genetic analysis of K-ras and p53 mutations in biopsy specimens and bile may be useful for the diagnosis of biliary tract cancers, although it may be effectively limited to patients with advanced disease",

    "Abstract": "To study the significance of p53 abnormality in parathyroid tumors, 32 parathyroid adenomas and 22 hyperplastic glands from 14 cases of secondary hyperparathyroidism were analysed using immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR- RFLP), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. Immunohistochemical study revealed p53 overexpression in four parathyroid adenomas, of which two showed diffuse and one showed focal nuclear pleomorphism. Genetic analysis disclosed allelic loss in one, and a point mutation (R290H) and a polymorphism (L257 L) in another of the two other adenomas with diffuse nuclear pleomorphism. No abnormalities were discovered in the other two adenomas, although one had a R72P polymorphism in exon 4. There was no evidence of malignancy of the four tumors in either clinical or pathological terms. None of the 22 hyperplastic glands showed p53 overexpression. These results demonstrate that p53 abnormality can occur in benign parathyroid adenomas and is more prevalent in those with nuclear pleomorphism than in those without",

    "Title": "Analysis of genetic changes in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma induced by thorotrast",
    "Abstract": "Thorotrast, a colloidal suspension of radioactive (232)ThO(2) that emits alpha particles, was used as a radiographic contrast agent in the 1930s-1950s. Several decades after injection, Thorotrast causes liver cancers, among which intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is prominent. We investigated mutations of the RAS and the TP53 genes in archival sections of ICC induced by Thorotrast. Compared to ICC that was not associated with Thorotrast, the frequency of mutation of the KRAS gene was lower, while that of the TP53 gene was more than two times higher. The most common mutation of the TP53 gene was A-G transitions. Interestingly, TP53 mutations were also found in noncancerous areas of livers in which Thorotrast had been deposited. Furthermore, mutations tended to accumulate in tissues from more advanced tumors. These results suggest that deposited Thorotrast continuously damages DNA in liver cells in some way, resulting in A-G transitions of the TP53 gene. However, we have not been able to rule out the possibility that genetic insults occur indirectly in the proliferating cells adjacent to the necrosis rather than being a direct effect of alpha particles",

    "Title": "High rate of small TP53 mutations and infrequent loss of heterozygosity in malignant liver tumors associated with thorotrast: implications for alpha-particle carcinogenesis",
    "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies have revealed that malignant tumors occur in the liver approximately 20 years after injection of Thorotrast. We investigated genetic changes in the TP53 gene (formerly known as p53) in malignant liver tumors related to Thorotrast to cast light on the mechanisms of alpha-particle carcinogenesis. A total of 19 autopsy cases of liver malignancies [11 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), 5 cholangiocellular carcinomas (CCC) and 3 angiosarcomas (AS)] were analyzed. Using archival tissues, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the 17p13 locus was analyzed. Then single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing were performed to detect mutations in exons 5 to 8 of the TP53 gene. As a result, 15 cases were informative in terms of polymorphism, and 4 cases showed LOH (3 HCC and 1 AS). Eight cases showed 9 mutations in exons and 2 in introns: 7 transitions (6 HCC and 1 CCC), 2 transversions (1 HCC and 1 AS), and 2 deletions (2 HCC). The direct action of alpha particles is thought to result in relatively large deletions such as those detected by LOH. Therefore, the low frequency of such changes (27%) compared to point mutations (47%) suggests that the genetic changes in the TP53 gene in the liver tumors related to Thorotrast were not caused mainly by direct actions of alpha particles but rather by indirect effects that may have been due to cycles of necrosis and regeneration",

    "Title": "Molecular genetic alterations in radiation-induced astrocytomas",
    "Abstract": "Astrocytic tumors occasionally arise in the central nervous system following radiotherapy. It is not clear if these gliomas represent a unique molecular genetic subset. We identified nine cases in which an astrocytoma arose within ports of previous radiation therapy, with total doses ranging from 2400 to 5500 cGy. Irradiated primary lesions included craniopharyngioma, pituitary adenoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, ependymoma, pineal neoplasm, rhabdomyosarcoma, and three cases of lymphoblastic malignancies. Patients ranged from 9 to 60 years of age and developed secondary tumors 5 to 23 years after radiotherapy. The 9 postradiation neoplasms presented as either anaplastic astrocytoma (3 cases) or glioblastoma multiforme (6 cases). Two of the latter contained malignant mesenchymal components. We performed DNA sequence analysis, differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and quantitative PCR on DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors to evaluate possible alterations of p53, PTEN, K-ras, EGFR, MTAP, and p16 (MTS1/CDKN2) genes. By quantitative PCR, we found EGFR gene amplification in 2 of 8 tumors. One of these demonstrated strong immunoreactivity for EGFR. Quantitative PCR showed chromosome 9p deletions including p16 tumor suppressor gene (2 of 7 tumors) and MTAP gene (3 of 7). Five of 9 tumors demonstrated diffuse nuclear immunoreactivity for p53 protein. Sequencing of the p53 gene in these 9 cases revealed a mutation in only one of these cases, a G-to-A substitution in codon 285 (exon 8). Somewhat unexpectedly, no mutations were identified in PTEN, a commonly altered tumor suppressor gene in de novo glioblastoma multiformes. Unlike some radiation-induced tumors, no activating point mutations of the K-ras proto-oncogene or base pair deletions of tumor suppressor genes were noted. These radiation-induced tumors are distinctive in their high histological grade at clinical presentation. The spectrum of molecular genetic alterations appears to be similar to that described in spontaneous high grade astrocytomas, especially those of the de novo type",

    "Abstract": "We analyzed the tumor suppressor gene product, p53, in elderly patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and in overt leukemia patients after transformation from MDS using immunohistochemical techniques. We examined 52 MDS patients (mean age 79 years, range 68 to 96) from the time of initial diagnosis to death or development of overt leukemia. p53 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 8/52 patients (15%) at initial diagnosis: 1/26 with refractory anemia (RA), 0/4 with RA with ringed sideroblasts, 3/11 with RA with an excess of blasts (RAEB), 3/8 with RAEB in transformation, and 1/3 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. We also analyzed gene mutations in patients with positive IHC. p53 mutations were detected in 3/8 (38%) patients. IHC-positive patients had a significantly higher incidence of leukemic transformation and the presence of a complex karyotype with monosomy 17. IHC-positive cells included blasts as well as mature myeloid cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes. Scrutiny of our data in combination with previous data revealed that patients with positive IHC in multilineage cells were older than those in whom positivity was noted mostly in myeloblasts. This suggests that p53 IHC positivity with a multilineage pattern may be a characteristic of MDS in older patients",

    "Title": "Molecular genetic aspects of oligodendrogliomas including analysis by comparative genomic hybridization",
    "Abstract": "Oligodendroglial neoplasms are a subgroup of gliomas with distinctive morphological characteristics. In the present study we have evaluated a series of these tumors to define their molecular profiles and to determine whether there is a relationship between molecular genetic parameters and histological pattern in this tumor type. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for 1p and 19q was seen in 17/23 (74%) well- differentiated oligodendrogliomas, in 18/23 (83%) anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, and in 3/8 (38%) oligoastrocytomas grades II and III. LOH for 17p and/or mutations of the TP53 gene occurred in 14 of these 55 tumors. Only one of the 14 cases with 17p LOH/TP53 gene mutation also had LOH for 1p and 19q, and significant astrocytic elements were seen histologically in the majority of these 14 tumors. LOH for 9p and/or deletion of the CDKN2A gene occurred in 15 of these 55 tumors, and 11 of these cases were among the 24 (42%) anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) identified the majority of cases with 1p and 19q loss and, in addition, showed frequent loss of chromosomes 4, 14, 15, and 18. These findings demonstrate that oligodendroglial neoplasms usually have loss of 1p and 19q whereas astrocytomas of the progressive type frequently contain mutations of the TP53 gene, and that 9p loss and CDKN2A deletions are associated with progression from well-differentiated to anaplastic oligodendrogliomas",

    "Abstract": "We examined bcl-2 expression as well as p53 expression and mutation in human uterine smooth muscle tumours to determine the influence of bcl-2 expression on prognosis in patients with uterine leiomyosarcomas. bcl-2 protein was expressed in nearly all benign smooth muscle tumours but in only 57% of leiomyosarcomas. Benign smooth muscle tumours were usually negative for p53 protein, but 16 out of 21 (76%) leiomyosarcomas were positive. A p53 gene mutation was detected in nine of the 16 leiomyosarcomas that showed p53-positive staining. A significant positive correlation was observed between p53 mutation and p53 expression, between the number of mitoses and the Ki-67 labelling index, and between clinical stage and p53 mutation. A significant negative correlation was observed between bcl-2 expression and p53 mutation, and between bcl-2 expression and p53 overexpression. Univariate survival analysis revealed that bcl-2 expression, p53 mutation and clinical stage (stage 1 vs stages 2-4) all showed a significant correlation with prognosis. In a multivariate stepwise regression analysis, positive bcl-2 expression and stage 1 disease were the independent predictors of a favourable prognosis. Our results suggest that bcl-2 is frequently expressed in human uterine smooth muscle tumours, and that its expression may correlate with a favourable prognosis in patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma",

    "Abstract": "p73 gene, a new p53 homologue, has been identified: it supposedly acts as tumour suppressor gene in neuroblastoma. To clarify whether p73 might be involved in lung carcinogenesis, we examined p73 expression in resected lung cancer and paired normal lung in 60 cases using semi- quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We also examined p73 gene status in three representative cases using Southern blot, and p53 gene alteration in 49 cases using PCR-single- strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequence. In 87% of the cases (52/60) p73 expression in tumour was more than twice as high as that in paired normal lung tissues, and the difference between p73 expression in tumour and normal lung tissue was significant (P < 0.0001). However, Southern blot analysis revealed that none of the cases showed p73 gene amplification. Compared with clinicopathological characteristics, p73 expression correlates significantly with histological differences and age of patient, independently (P < 0.05). Concerning p53 gene status, 43% (21/49) showed p53 gene alteration, but there was no correlation between p73 overexpression and p53 gene alteration. Our results suggest that need for further functional analysis of the role of p73 in lung carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Molecular epidemiological study of non-small-cell lung cancer from an environmentally polluted region of Poland",
    "Abstract": "The p53 mutation spectrum can generate hypotheses linking carcinogen exposure to human cancer. Although it is well-documented that tobacco smoking is a major cause of lung cancer, the contribution of air pollution is less well-established. We determined the molecular and immunohistochemical changes (p53 gene mutations, p53 protein accumulation and WAF1 protein expression) and genetic polymorphisms of GSTM1, CYP1A1 and CYP2D6 genes in a case series of non-small-cell lung cancers from Silesia. This region of southern Poland is highly industrialized with considerable environmental pollution. More than 50% of lung cancers (90/164) contained p53 mutations and 75% showed the combined alteration of the p53 gene and protein accumulation. Males occupationally exposed to coal-derived substances showed a relatively high frequency of squamous and large-cell carcinomas, relatively frequent mutations in codon 298 of p53 and a low frequency of p53 immunohistochemically positive tumours. Codon 298 GAG-->TAG mutations have rarely been found in lung cancers in other populations. We found no correlation between WAF1 protein expression and mutations in the p53 gene or p53 protein accumulation. No statistically significant relationship was found between p53 mutations and GSTM1, CYP1A1, CYP2D6 genotypes. Never smokers with lung cancers from Silesia had a higher frequency of G:C-->T:A transversions than previously reported of the p53 mutation spectrum in never smokers (6/15 vs 4/34; P = 0.06 by chi2). These data are a tentative indication that occupational and environmental exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo(a)pyrene, in polluted air contributes to the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer in never smokers",

    "Title": "Elderly Japanese women with cervical carcinoma show higher proportions of both intermediate-risk human papillomavirus types and p53 mutations",
    "Abstract": "The p53 mutation has been found only in 0-6% of cervical carcinomas. In light of recent studies demonstrating that mutation of p53 gene was found in over 20% of the patients with vulvar carcinoma, a disease of elderly women and a known human papillomavirus (HPV)-related malignancy, we analysed mutation of the p53 gene in 46 women with cervical carcinomas at the age of 60 or more (mean; 71 years, range; 60- 96 years). The presence of HPV and its type were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay using the consensus primers for L1 region. Mutation of the p53 gene was analysed by PCR-based single- strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing technique. Point mutation of the p53 gene was detected in 5 out of 46 (11%) cervical carcinomas: 1 of 17 (6%) samples associated with high-risk HPVs (HPV 16 and HPV 18) and 4 of 27 samples (15%) with intermediate-risk HPVs (P= 0.36) whereas no mutation was found in 2 HPV negative cases. The mutated residues resided in the selective sequence known as a DNA- binding domain. The immunohistochemistry revealed the overexpression in cancer tissues positive for p53 mutation. All of the observed mutations of the p53 gene were transition type, suggesting that the mutation may be caused by endogenous mutagenesis. Although falling short of statistical significance reduces the strength of the conclusion, data presented here imply that p53 gene mutation, particularly along with intermediate-risk HPV types, may constitute one pathogenetic factor in cervical carcinoma affecting elderly women",

    "Title": "Mechanisms of relapse in acute leukaemia: involvement of p53 mutated subclones in disease progression in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 tumour suppressor gene are infrequent at presentation of both acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), being found in between 5-10% of AML and 2-3% of ALL. Here we have studied the frequency of detection of p53 mutations at relapse of both AML and B-precursor ALL. In those patients with detectable mutations at relapse we investigated whether the mutation was detectable at presentation and was thus an early initiating event or whether it had arisen as a late event associated with relapse. Bone marrow samples from 55 adults and children with relapsed AML (n = 41) or ALL (n = 14) were analysed for p53 gene alterations by direct sequencing of exons 5-9. For samples where a p53 mutation was found at relapse, analysis of presentation samples was carried out by direct sequencing of the exon involved, or by allele- specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if the mutation could not be detected using direct sequencing. A p53 mutated gene was found at relapse in seven out of 55 cases. The frequency was higher in relapsed ALL (four out of 14 cases; 28.6%) compared to AML (three out of 41 cases; 7.3%). In five out of the seven cases presentation samples were available to study for the presence of the mutation. In two out of two AML patients the p53 mutation was detectable in the presentation sample by direct sequencing. In three ALL patients analysis of presentation material by direct sequencing showed a small mutant peak in one case, the other two being negative despite the sample analysed containing > 90% blast cells. However in both of these patients, the presence of p53 mutation was confirmed in the presentation sample using allele-specific PCR. In one of these patients the emergence of a subclone at relapse was confirmed by clonality analysis using IgH fingerprinting. Our results confirm that in ALL p53 mutations are present in a proportion of patients at relapse. Furthermore cells carrying the mutation are detectable at presentation in a minor clone suggesting that p53 mutations in ALL may be a mechanism contributing to disease relapse",

    "Abstract": "In melanoma, the relationship between sun exposure and the origin of mutations in either the N-ras oncogene or the p53 tumour-suppressor gene is not as clear as in other types of skin cancer. We have previously shown that mutations in the N-ras gene occur more frequently in melanomas originating from sun-exposed body sites, indicating that these mutations are UV induced. To investigate whether sun exposure also affects p53 in melanoma, we analysed 81 melanoma specimens for mutations in the p53 gene. The mutation frequency is higher than thus far reported: 17 specimens (21%) harbour one or more p53 mutations. Strikingly, 17 out of 22 mutations in p53 are of the C:G to TA or CC:GG to TT:AA transitional type, strongly suggesting an aetiology involving UV exposure. Interestingly, the p53 mutation frequency in metastases was much lower than in primary tumours. In the case of metastases, a role for sun exposure was indicated by the finding that the mutations are present exclusively in skin metastases and not in internal metastases. Together with a relatively frequent occurrence of silent third-base pair mutations in primary melanomas, this indicates that the p53 mutations, at least in these tumours, have not contributed to melanomagenesis and may have originated after establishment of the primary tumour",

    "Abstract": "p53 alterations are considered to be predictive of poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and may induce a humoral response. Anti- p53 serum antibodies were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified recombinant human p53 on 130 European HCC patients before treatment and during the clinical course of the disease. p53 immunohistochemistry was performed on tumours from the 52 patients who underwent surgery, and DNA sequencing analysis was initiated when circulating anti-p53 antibodies were detected. Nine (7%) HCC patients had anti-p53 serum antibodies before treatment. During a mean period of 30 months of follow-up, all the negative patients remained negative, even when recurrence was observed. Of the nine positive patients, eight were still positive 12-30 months after surgery. The presence of anti-p53 serum antibodies was correlated neither with mutation of the p53 gene nor the serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and clinicopathological characteristics of the tumours. However, a greater incidence of vascular invasion and accumulation of p53 protein were observed in the tumours of these patients (P<0.03 and P<0.01 respectively) as well as a better survival rate without recurrence (P = 0.05). In conclusion, as was recently shown in pancreatic cancer, anti-p53 serum antibodies may constitute a marker of relative 'good prognosis' in a subgroup of patients exhibiting one or several markers traditionally thought to be of bad prognosis",

    "Title": "Genetic alterations in hepatocellular carcinomas: association between loss of chromosome 4q and p53 gene mutations",
    "Abstract": "The major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in high incidence areas include infection with hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) and exposure to aflatoxin. Genetic alterations in 24 liver resection specimens from Shanghai and Qidong were studied. Hepatitis B virus was integrated in all patient samples, and a null phenotype for the GSTM1 enzyme was present in 63% of patients. Alteration of p53 was present in 95% (23/24) of cases: mutations of the p53 gene in 12 HCC, p53 overexpression in 13 and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 17p in 17. All seven HCCs with a p53 mutation from Qidong and three of five from Shanghai had the aflatoxin-associated point mutation with a G to T transversion at codon 249, position 3. No HCC had microsatellite instability. LOH of chromosome 4q, 1p, 16q and 13q was present in 50%, 46%, 42% and 38%, respectively, and 4q was preferentially lost in HCCs containing a p53 mutation: LOH of 4q was present in 75% (9/12) of HCC with, but only 25% (3/12) of HCC without, a p53 gene mutation (P = 0.01). These data indicate a possible interaction between p53 gene mutation and 4q loss in the pathogenesis of HCC",

    "Title": "Frequent loss of expression or aberrant alternative splicing of P2XM, a p53-inducible gene, in soft-tissue tumours",
    "Abstract": "We investigated expression of a human p53-inducible gene, P2XM, a member of the P2X-receptor family of ATP-gated ion channels, in 56 human primary soft-tissue tumours including 47 sarcomas and nine benign tumors. Among the 47 sarcomas examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, 12 had lost expression of this gene and 22 revealed altered splicing patterns; among the nine benign tumours, four showed no expression of P2XM and three revealed aberrant splicing patterns involving transmembrane domains M1 and/or M2. As the aberrant transcripts lacked either or both of those domains, the protein products probably lacked normal function. We also looked for p53 mutations and mdm2 overexpression in the same panel of tumours and found them in 13 tumours, all but three of which had shown altered expression of P2XM. However, 31 (72%) of the 43 tumours that carried wild-type p53 without mdm2 overexpression had revealed aberrant P2XM expression. Our results suggest that disorder of P2XM expression may play a crucial role in the genesis of benign and malignant tumours in soft tissues, and that one or more genetic factors other than p53 or mdm2 contribute significantly to aberrant P2XM expression",

    "Title": "Discrimination of double primary lung cancer from intrapulmonary metastasis by p53 gene mutation",
    "Abstract": "When multiple synchronous lung tumours are identified, discrimination of multicentric lung cancers from intrapulmonary metastases by clinical findings is often difficult. We used genetic alterations in p53 gene as a discrimination marker of double primary lung cancers from single lung cancer with intrapulmonary metastasis. Twenty of 861 patients with primary lung cancer who underwent lung resection were selected as subjects because they showed synchronous double solid tumours of the same histological type in the unilateral lung without distant metastases. In addition, they had been diagnosed as lung carcinoma with intrapulmonary metastasis by clinical and histological findings. DNAs were extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue of paired tumours from these 20 patients. Exons 5-9 of the p53 gene were examined for genetic alterations in the tumours by polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and subsequent DNA sequencing analysis. Three different patterns in the distribution of p53 mutations in double lung tumours were observed: [A] mutation in only one of the tumours (four cases), [B] different mutations in the tumours (two cases), and [C] same mutation in both tumours (one case). The cases of [A] or [B] patterns could be classified as double primary lung cancers, while the case of the [C] pattern was suggested to be lung cancer with intrapulmonary metastasis. These results suggested that the multicentric cancers were more frequent than the intrapulmonary metastatic cancers in double cancer cases",

    "Abstract": "To understand the role of p53 tumour suppressor gene in the carcinogenesis of arsenic-related skin cancers from the blackfoot disease endemic area of Taiwan, we collected tumour samples from 23 patients with Bowen's disease, seven patients with basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and nine patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). The result showed that p53 gene mutations were found in 39% of cases with Bowen's disease (9/23), 28.6% of cases with BCC (2/7) and 55.6% of cases with SCC (5/9). Most of the mutation sites were located on exon 5 and exon 8. Moreover, the results from direct sequencing indicated that missense mutations were found at codon 149 (C-->T) in one case, codon 175 (G-->A) in three cases, codon 273 (G-->C) in three cases, codon 292 (T-->A) in one case, codon 283 (G-->T) in one case, codon 172 (T-->C) in one case and codon 284 (C-->A) in one case. In addition, silent mutations were also found in four cases. These mutations were located at codons 174, 253, 289 and 298 respectively. In immunohistochemistry analysis, p53 overexpression was found in 43.5% (10/23) of cases with Bowen's disease, 14% (1/7) of cases with BCC and 44% (4/9) of cases with SSC. These findings showed that p53 gene mutation rate in arsenic- related skin cancers from the blackfoot disease endemic area of Taiwan is high and that the mutation types are different from those in UV- induced skin cancers",

    "Abstract": "Clarification of somatic mutations during the progression of human astrocytomas is important in order to understand the mechanisms underlying the development of these tumors. We analyzed surgical specimens of human astrocytomas for mutations in the p53 gene using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction product (PCR-SSCP analysis) at a low pH. Klenow fragment treatment after PCR amplification was an effective means to get rid of some extra bands on the SSCP gel. Five mutations in three of 24 astrocytomas were identified by this improved SSCP method. The frequency of p53 gene mutations in astrocytomas examined was 12.5%. Further examination by direct sequencing showed that all five mutants had single-base substitutions resulting in missense mutations. The present studies revealed a loss of heterozygosity and two point mutations on the remaining allele in one of the fibrillary astrocytomas. Finally, the improvement of PCR-SSCP analysis using Klenow treatment and low pH showed a distinct electrophoresis gel pattern and could be relevant for the prognosis of human astrocytomas",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been found to be the single most frequent event in human cancers. In India and other southeast Asian countries tobacco chewing with betel quid was attributed to be the major factor in oral carcinogenesis. We have analyzed 72 untreated primary oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) for mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 exons 4-9 by PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing. Sequencing analysis revealed 16 missense mutations, one silent mutation in codon 307 and four A to G substitution polymorphism in codon 213. The incidence of p53 mutation was 21% (15 of 72) excluding the polymorphism and the silent mutation. Eight mutations were clustered in codons 266-282 of exon 8. Of the total mutation events 37.5% were G to A transitions and 31.3% were G to T transversions. These results indicate the possible involvement of tobacco derived nitrosamines and their adducts in the genesis of oral cancer among Indians",

    "Abstract": "To date, the characteristics of p53 gene mutations in lung cancer have been extensively investigated. However, current estimates of p53 alterations are inaccurate, since most investigators have limited their analyses to exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene. We examined 52 lung carcinoma cell lines and 106 primary non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) for mutations in the entire coding region of the p53 gene, from exons 2 to 11. High resolution single strand conformation polymorphism analysis was performed using a modified electrophoretic apparatus with a high concentration gel (14%) and accurate temperature control. The prevalence of mutations was high (more than 80%) in both small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (15 of 18) and NSCLC cell lines (28 of 34), and 9 of 45 mutations (20%) were detected outside the region of exons 5 to 8. The frequency of the mutations in primary NSCLC was 48% (51 of 106) and was significantly different (p=0.01) between adenocarcinoma (39%) and squamous cell carcinoma (67%). A-->G transitions (14%, 6 of 43 cases) as well as G-->T transversions (26%, 11 of 43 cases) were frequently detected with significant strand bias in smoking patients, suggesting that carcinogens causing these mutations are involved in smoking associated lung carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Tumor suppressor gene alterations in malignant gliomas: histopathological associations and prognostic evaluation",
    "Abstract": "We have examined a series of 135 gliomas for alterations of the p53, CDKN2A (p16) and PTEN tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in order to evaluate the incidence of their inactivation as a function of tumor malignancy and cellular differentiation, and to examine potential associations with patient outcome. The composition of this series, classified using WHO criteria, is as follows: 27 grade 2 tumors (11 astrocytomas, 12 oligoastrocytomas, 4 oligodendrogliomas), 42 grade 3 tumors (22 astrocytomas, 16 oligoastrocytomas, 4 oligodendrogliomas), and 66 grade 4 tumors (63 astrocytomas and 3 oligoastrocytomas). Similar frequencies of p53 mutation were observed among grade 2 (37.0%), and grade 3 tumors (38.1%), as well as between astrocytomas and mixed tumors. CDKN2A and PTEN mutations were clearly associated with increasing tumor malignancy (occurring in 0% of grade 2 tumors, 14.3% and 4.8% respectively of grade 3 tumors, and 27.3% and 30.3% respectively of grade 4 tumors) and were observed at substantially higher rates among astrocytomas. For the tumor suppressor genes examined, there was no relationship between the occurrence of any two TSG inactivation events. With regard to outcome, the p53 genetic status showed no significant relationship with patient survival. The CDKN2 and PTEN alterations were negative prognostic indicators of survival when evaluated in all 135 gliomas, but failed to predict outcome when evaluated in either of the high grade (3 or 4) tumor groups",

    "Title": "High frequency of TP53 mutations in juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas indicates role of TP53 in the development of these tumors",
    "Abstract": "In adults, the TP53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated in astrocytic brain tumors which is supposed to represent an early event in their development. In juvenile pilocytic and low-grade astrocytomas, however, TP53 mutations have until now been reported as rare, which has led to the suggestion that these tumors may follow a different molecular pathogenesis with an involvement of genes other than TP53. Our analysis of 20 pilocytic and two low-grade astrocytomas of childhood, based on a comprehensive denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) mutation detection assay of the entire coding region, including all splice site junctions of TP53, showed mutations considered as causative in 7 of the 20 (35%) pilocytic astrocytomas and in one of the two low-grade astrocytomas. Our finding is significantly different from the mutation frequency of 1.3% (2/155) previously reported for these tumor types. This may be attributed to the mutation detection system used, which also detects mutations occurring outside the evolutionary conserved region of TP53. Our results suggest that, contrary to the present notion, TP53 mutations may well play a role in the development of juvenile astrocytomas. Furthermore, no mutations were found in tumors of patients with progression of residual tumor after postoperative follow-up. This suggests that TP53 mutations may be associated with less aggressive forms of juvenile astrocytomas, analogous to the situation in adult astrocytomas",

    "Abstract": "The aim of our study was to evaluate if p53 mutations, especially those in the L2/L3 domains of the p53 gene, add prognostic information for node-positive and steroid receptor positive breast cancer patients. Two hundred and five tumour samples from a randomised clinical trial of 596 lymph node- and steroid receptor positive breast cancer patients were included. All patients had been randomly allocated to receive 20 mg of adjuvant tamoxifen (TAM) daily for 2 years or TAM plus one cycle of low- dose, short-term chemotherapy. For detection of p53 mutations we used in vitro amplification by polymerase chain reaction and consecutively performed temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-TGGE) and direct sequencing. We found p53 mutations in 42/205 (20%) cases: 16/42 (38%) p53 mutations occurred within the L2/L3 domains of the p53 gene, and 26/42 (62%) outside the L2/L3 domains. p53 mutation served as a statistically significant parameter in predicting disease-free survival in univariate (P = 0.02) and multivariate (P = 0.009) analysis. For overall survival, no significant differences were observed. Patients with tumours that had p53 mutations within the L2/L3 domains of the gene showed no significant difference to those with mutations outside the L2/L3 domains for disease-free survival. For overall survival, mutations in the L2/L3 domains showed a marginally significant difference (P = 0.05) in multivariate analysis, but not in univariate analysis (P = 0.13). We conclude that mutation in the L2/L3 domains of the p53 gene is not an independent prognostic indicator of disease outcome for patients suffering from breast cancer with lymph node metastases and positive steroid receptors",

TP53 mutation is common in a variety of cancers but its role in vulvar cancer is not well established. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of HPV infection and TP53 mutation as well as their correlation in vulvar cancer. Also, HPV detection and abnormal p53 expression were assessed in relation to age, co-existing vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia and vulvar dystrophy. Forty-eight samples of vulvar cancer were studied. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue for polymerase chain reaction/Southern blot study with HPV 16 and 18 and L1 primers. Paraffin sections were immunostained (IHS) for p53 protein using three antibodies, p1801, CM1 and DO7. The p53 mutation was also screened using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and confirmed by sequencing. Overall, HPV was detected in 48% (23/48), of which 96% (22/23) were HPV 16 or 18. By IHS, p53 overexpression was detected in 46% of cases whilst TP53 mutations were identified in 21%. In HPV positive and negative tumours, p53 abnormal expression was detected in 39% and 52%, respectively, and TP53 mutation was found in 22% and 20%, respectively. Mutations were mainly found at codons 273 and 204. Age was not found to be associated with HPV detection. However, the presence of HPV (71%) or absence of abnormal p53 expression (65%) were higher in tumours with VIN3, but were not correlated with dystrophy",

    "Abstract": "The p53 protein has proven to be central in tumorigenesis by its cell cycle regulatory properties and both gene mutations and protein accumulation have been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. The present study was undertaken to investigate the prognostic significance of gene mutations, p53 protein accumulation and of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the TP53 locus in young (age < 37 years) breast cancer patients. In total, gene mutations were found in 21 of the 123 patients (17%), LOH in 20 of the 47 informative cases (43%) and protein accumulation in 47 of the 102 available cases (46%). Log rank analysis revealed no significant association between survival and TP53 mutations (in general), p53 protein accumulation or LOH. However, missense mutations localised to the zinc binding domain were significantly (P = 0.0007) associated with poorer prognosis. As indicated in this as well as other studies, p53 protein accumulation is frequently found in young breast cancer patients, but this protein overexpression appears to be of minor significance for survival. Nevertheless, the present report also suggests that specific mutations contribute substantially to tumour aggressiveness.",

No lines were contaminated with Mycoplasma or bacteria. All lines were proven to be unique by DNA-fingerprinting analysis. All lines expressed the surface carcino-embryonic antigen and secreted it into the supernatant fluid. The morphological correlation between the original tumors and cultured cells suggested that the original tumors showing mucinous adenocarcinoma correlated with floating aggregates in culture, and degree of desmoplasia in the original tumor correlated with attached growth in culture. Five of the cell lines showed mutations in the K- ras2 gene, and 6 of the cell lines showed mutations in the p53 gene. The p15 gene was deleted in 2 cell lines, and the p16 gene was hypermethylated in 3 cell lines. The mutation of mismatch-repair genes (hMLH1 and hMSH2) was found in 4 lines, the APC gene and beta-catenin gene were mutated in 9 and 2 lines respectively. These well- characterized colorectal-cancer cell lines should serve as useful tools for investigating the biological characteristics of colorectal cancer",

    "Abstract": "Oral squamous-cell carcinoma is thought to be preceded by a number of precursor stages which induce morphological changes in cells of the oral mucosa resulting in clinically detectable pre-malignant lesions such as erythroplakia or leukoplakia. To better understand the etiology of oral erythroplakia, we have examined the p53 tumor-suppressor gene (exons 5-9) for mutations in 24 oral erythroplakia lesions of varying dysplastic phenotypes by PCR/single-strand conformational polymorphism and direct DNA-sequencing analyses. A total of 12 p53 mutations were detected in 11 of 24 (46%) erythroplakia specimens (one specimen contained two different p53 mutations); 25% were single-base-pair deletions and 33% were either G:C-->T:A transversions or G:C-->A:T transitions. A high prevalence of p53 mutation was observed in all categories of erythroplakia lesions: 33% for mildly dysplastic lesions, 50% for lesions exhibiting moderate to severe dysplasia and 50% for lesions that were carcinoma in situ. Although the combined prevalence of p53 mutations observed in erythroplakia was significantly higher (p = 0.02) than that observed earlier for leukoplakia, the prevalence of p53 mutations was similar in erythroplakia and leukoplakia specimens from smokers. The prevalence and spectrum of p53 mutations observed in this series of erythroplakia lesions are similar to those observed for oral squamous-cell carcinoma. These results indicate that mutations of the p53 gene may be linked to the high malignant potential of erythroplakia and provide further evidence that p53 mutation may be an early event in the genesis of oral squamous-cell carcinoma",

Our study was designed to compare cellular events (p53-protein accumulation and gene mutations) with the presence of circulating anti-p53 antibodies (p53-Ab). Thirty- five colorectal-cancer patients were studied for their intratumoral p53- protein accumulation and circulating p53-Ab. Tumour DNA was analyzed for genomic mutations in a sub-set of 28 patients. In all, 18 tumours (51.4%) were positive by immunohistochemistry, and 17 tumour extracts were shown to contain 'mutant' conformation p53 protein, 16 of them being were concordant by both methods. Of the 28 tumours tested by DGGE, 16 contained alterations in p53 exons 5 to 8 (57.1%). Of 12 tumours without detectable mutations, 10 were 'mutant'-conformation- negative by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Paradiploid tumors presented more frequently wild-type p53 genes and were significantly less frequently immunohistochemistry- or p53-Ab-positive than polyploid tumors. Circulating p53-Ab were detected in the serum of 11 patients (31%). In 9/11 cases, a gene mutation was found in the corresponding tumour. Three of four mutations in exon 8 and 3/3 mutations in exons 5- 6 were associated with p53-Ab, in contrast with only 3/9 mutations in exon 7. We found good agreement in the detection of p53-gene alterations by different methods. However, our data suggest that all gene mutations may not be equivalent in term of immunogenicity",

OSCCs (14 from Sudan, 28 from Scandinavia), and 3 pre-malignant oral lesions from Sudanese non-dippers were used as controls. A statistically significant increased incidence in mutations of the p53 gene was found in OSCCs from toombak dippers (93%; 13/14), as compared with those from non- dippers in Sudan (57%; 8/14) and in Scandinavia (61%; 17/28) respectively. In OSCCs from dippers, mutations were found in exons 5 to 9, while in those from non-dippers they were found in exons 5, 7, 8, 9, and no mutations were found in exon 8 in any of the OSCCs from Sudan. Certain types of mutations, however, were similar with respect to exposure to toombak. OSCCs from dippers showed 15 transversions, 9 transitions, 3 insertions and one deletion, compared with 7 transversions, 2 transitions and one deletion found in OSCCs from Sudanese non-dippers, and 9 transversions, 17 transitions and 2 insertions found in those from non-dippers in Scandinavia. No mutations were found in any of the non-malignant oral lesions in relation to dipping or non-dipping status. These findings suggest that (i) the use of toombak plays a significant role in induction of increased p53 gene mutations, (ii) mutations observed were similar to those induced by tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNAs) in experimental animal models and those already reported in toombak dippers, (iii) types of mutations associated with TSNAs were similar in the exposed and the control groups, (iv) a novel mutation in exon 6 was found in the OSCCs from toombak dippers, (v) the p53 exons 5 (codon 130), 6 (codons 190, 216) and 7 (codons 229, 249, 252) mutations are probable hot spots for toombak-related OSCCs. Further studies are necessary to validate the increased incidence and exon locations of the p53-gene mutations as a biomarker of malignant transformation in populations in which the oral use of tobacco is habitual",

    "Title": "Molecular analysis of glioma and skin-tumour alterations in a xeroderma- pigmentosum child",
    "Abstract": "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare hereditary disease characterized by a very high frequency of skin tumours due to a defect in the nucleotide-excision-repair process. Some of these patients have also been reported to develop internal tumours with higher frequency than the normal population. Reported here are the clinical features and molecular analysis of an XP patient who developed multiple skin cancers as well as a thalamic glioma. Complementation analysis with recombinant retrovirus, cloning efficiency and unscheduled DNA synthesis after UV-C indicate that the patient belongs to the C group. Characterization of the p53 mutations in the 2 tumours of the patient leads to speculation on the aetiological agents involved in tumour initiation. The skin tumour is clearly induced by the presence of unrepaired UVB-induced DNA damage on the non-transcribed strand of the p53 gene, while the glioma may be induced by unrepaired DNA lesions produced by free radicals",

    "Title": "Different frequencies of p53 codon-249 hot-spot mutations in hepatocellular carcinomas in Jiang-su province of China",
    "Abstract": "Environmental carcinogens often induce specific mutations in the p53 gene, apparent in tumors. The relation between aflatoxin B1 (AFB1 )- related hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and hot spot at codon 249 of the p53 gene has received a great deal of attention, but its significance is still controversial. To clarify this problem, we analyzed the p53-mutational status of HCCs in Jiang-su province in China, where AFB1 contamination of the staple food significantly differs between the northern and southern parts (prominent only in the latter), while other conditions are quite similar. Background liver status and mutations in exons 5 to 8 of p53 in a total of 31 cases were divided approximately equally between the 2 areas. In all, 15 tumors exhibited a total of 17 mutations in the p53 gene; 9 cases from the southern part of the province had the hot-spot mutation at codon 249 (9/16, 56%), but only one case from the northern part (1/15, 8%). These results suggest that AFB1 contamination may correlate with codon-249 mutations in HCC",

    "Title": "Multiple primary tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract: is there a role for constitutional mutations in the p53 gene?",
    "Abstract": "Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) patients have a high risk of developing second primary tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract, the main cause of death. Although the roles of tobacco and diet in multiple head-and- neck carcinogenesis have been thoroughly investigated, little is known about individual genetic susceptibility factors involved in this process. Genomic instability, reflecting the propensity and the susceptibility of the genome to acquire multiple alterations, could be considered a driving force behind multiple carcinogenesis. Mutation of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene has been proposed to play an important role in this process. Therefore, we evaluated the incidence of inherited p53 germ-line alteration(s) in a population of 24 consecutive HNC patients and their first-degree relatives affected by multiple malignancies as well as the occurrence of p53 somatic acquired mutation(s) in 16 cancers, including first and second primaries from 5 HNCs of the same group. Mutations in exons 4-11 of the p53 gene were investigated using SSCP-PCR analysis and DNA sequencing. Analysis was extended to the peripheral blood and cancer biopsies available from first-degree relatives of cancer-prone families with p53 germ-line mutations. p53 germ-line mutations were identified in the peripheral blood and corresponding cancers of 3 HNC patients who had multiple malignancies. The only missense mutation detected was mapped in exon 6; it is a GTG to GAG substitution with an amino acid change from Val to Glu at codon 197. The remaining 2 p53 germ-line mutations were single- nucleotide substitutions without amino acid change in exon 6 (codon 213, CGA to CGG) and in exon 8 (codon 295, CCT to CCC), respectively. These mutations were found in HNC patients with a family history of cancer. Abnormal expression of wild-type p53 protein in normal and pathological tissues from patients with the same sense single- nucleotide substitutions was detected by immuno-histochemistry",

    "Abstract": "p53 status was tested in 180 patients with primary breast cancer using a yeast functional assay. Mutations were identified in 32% of cases. Only half were point missense mutations; the remainder were nonsense, insertion, deletion and splice site mutations. Twenty-two percent of mutations were located outside exons 5-8. For a median follow-up of 88 months, survival analysis showed that p53 mutation conferred a worse prognosis in the whole population and the node-positive subgroup but not in node-negative patients. p53 status, tumour size >2 cm, axillary lymph node metastasis and high histological grade were major adverse risk factors in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis of 153 patients for whom full data were available showed that p53 status contributed prognostic information when tumour size and lymph node status were taken into account but not when histological grade was included. p53 status thus contributes only limited new prognostic information in breast cancer when established prognostic factors are taken into account.

    "Abstract": "A cell line (ISO-HAS) has been established from tumor tissue of a human hemangiosarcoma arising on the scalp by the use of conditioned medium from a murine-phenotypic angiosarcoma cell line (ISOS-1). Cells have been cultured for more than 2 years with up to 100 passages. The cells retained endothelial-cell properties, such as a characteristic cobblestone appearance at confluency, contact-inhibited growth, active uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein labeled with 1,1- dioctadecyl 1,3,3,3,3-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI-Ac- LDL) and CD31 expression. However, they were weakly positive for von- Willebrand-factor (vWf) antigen and for binding of Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I) lectin, and lacked tube-formation activity. These findings indicate that ISO-HAS is a poorly differentiated endothelial cell line. ISO-HAS cells showed accumulation of p53 protein in the nuclei, and a new-typed p53-gene point mutation was found in exon 7 at codon 240. When inoculated s.c. into severe-combined-immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, the cells showed solid-tumor growth that caused death. These properties suggest that ISO-HAS is a malignant endothelial cell line with high tumorigenicity",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: We examined whether p53 gene mutations were predictive of clinical behavior in laryngeal cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of 45 patients with laryngeal cancer from 1985 to 1997. METHODS: DNA was extracted from tumor tissue and subject to polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) as well as DNA sequencing. The clinical outcome was correlated to the presence or absence of a p53 mutation. RESULTS: The p53 gene was analyzed by direct DNA sequencing and was found to be mutated in 33% (15/45) of patients. The presence of a p53 mutation was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival (80% vs. 43%, P < .03) and a trend toward improved disease-free survival (87% vs. 60%, P = .08). When other prognostic factors were adjusted, multivariate analysis revealed a trend toward improvement in overall survival as well as disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: Depending on the location of a p53 mutation, the suppressive functions or clinical outcome may or may not be affected. Fifty-three percent of mutations were detected in nonconserved regions as opposed to 17% as reported in colon cancer. In colon cancer, mutations in conserved regions of the p53 gene predicted a poorer survival, whereas nonconserved gene mutations were not predictive. In our group of patients. p53 mutations predicted a better prognosis, which may be due to a large proportion of mutations that lie within nonconserved areas. The predictive power of p53 gene mutations may depend on functional loss and inactivation of highly conserved areas and must be tested in a prospective trial",

STUDY DESIGN: In vitro culture of six squamous cell carcinoma cell lines derived from primary tumors of the larynx. Description of the cell line phenotypes and determination of molecular characteristics. METHODS: Six laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were cultured. The cell phenotypes, including the histopathology of the primary tumors and in vitro growth characteristics, were determined. Molecular characterization was also performed, including DNA fingerprinting analysis and abnormalities of p15, p16, p53, and TGF- betaRII genes by polymerase chain reaction-based single strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analysis. RESULTS: All cell lines grew as adherent cells; five lines grew as monolayers and one other line grew as stratifying colonies. All lines showed 1) high viability (75%-92%) with various doubling times (36-96 h); 2) absence of Mycoplasma and other bacteria; and 3) genetic heterogeneity by DNA profile analysis. p53 Mutations were found in three lines and p16 mutations were observed in five cell lines. TGF-betaRII mutations were found in two lines: one line had frameshift mutation and another line had a missense mutation at the kinase domain. CONCLUSIONS: These newly established and characterized laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines will be useful for investigating the biologic characteristics of laryngeal cancer",

    "Abstract": "To clarify the genetic background of cancer patients, microsatellite instability (MSI) and mutations of transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor (RII), p53 and k-ras gene were investigated. MSI were detected in 33.3% of esophageal, 15.8% of gastric, 21.4% of colorectal, 4.5% of bile duct, 0% of gallbladder, 13.3% of pancreatic, 11.6% of breast and 10.5% of thyroid cancers. Mutations of RII gene were detected in only 2 of 9 MSI-positive colorectal cancers. k-ras gene mutations were investigated in colorectal, bile duct, gallbladder, breast and thyroid cancer and were detected in 11.9%, 36.4%, 64.3%, 0%, 0% of each. p53 gene mutations were investigated in colorectal and breast cancer and were detected in 9.5% and 9.3%, respectively. In addition, 4 colorectal cancer cases exhibited more than two kinds of genetic alteration, while breast cancer cases showed only single kind. From these findings, it is suggested that 1) the incidence of each genetic alteration differed among the cancers investigated and organ specificity may exist; 2) the genetic alterations investigated here contributed to a minor part of cancer development, which requires the identification of more unknown genes related to carcinogenesis; 3) to clarify the molecular mechanism of cancer development, the genetic alterations including genomic instability and mutations of several kinds of genes related to cancer development in each case should also be determined along with their genetic molecular profile",

    "Title": "The need for microdissectional tumor cell preparation during the molecular genetic analysis of prostate cancer",
    "Abstract": "For clinically localized prostate cancer, recent studies strongly indicate that the determination of p53 inactivation allows the identification of a highly aggressive subgroup of prostatic tumors associated with decreased recurrence-free and long-term survival following radical prostatectomy. However, several questions regarding the determination of p53 alterations in prostate cancer, such as the poor correlation between immunohistochemistry and molecular genetic analysis, remain to be clarified. On the DNA level, p53 gene alterations have been identified in only up to 64% of tumors exhibiting immunohistochemically detected overexpression of the p53 oncoprotein. This discrepancy can be explained either by the genetic microheterogeneity of prostate cancer or by stabilization of the wild- type protein due to posttranslational events. In the present study we tried to determine the concordance between an immunohistochemically detected p53 overexpression and the result of molecular genetic analysis. Therefore, tumor tissue obtained by microdissection from 40 prostate cancer specimens was subjected to DNA-sequence analysis. Microdissection was based either only on histopathologic criteria or on the result of the immunohistochemical staining reaction. In 8 of 14 (57%) tumors a positive immunohistochemical reaction could be confirmed by DNA sequencing, which revealed a missense point mutation at the p53 gene locus, mainly in the form of G-->A transversion in exon 5 of the p53 gene. Following the micropreparation of tumor cells exhibiting p53 oncoprotein overexpression, missense point mutation could be detected in an additional 4 cases. Following a microscopically guided tumor cell dissection according to the result of immunohistochemistry, DNA sequencing confirmed an immunohistochemically detected p53 overexpression in 86% of cases investigated. This result indicates that a microdissectional tumor cell preparation is recommended for molecular genetic analysis of histologically heterogeneous tissue specimens such as prostate cancer and should be performed according to and in addition to the result of immunohistochemistry when an immunohistochemical approach is available",

    "Abstract": "Relapse is a major cause of treatment failure in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and is usually accompanied by resistance to chemotherapy. To study whether relapse is accompanied by genetic alterations, we compared N-ras, p53 and FLT3 gene mutations in paired samples obtained at initial diagnosis and first relapse. 28 patients with relapsed AML were studied, and their duration of complete remission ranged from 133 to 989 d (mean 318 d). Karyotype changes were observed at relapse in 11 patients. Point mutations of the N-ras gene were positive at both stages (+/+) in three patients, positive at initial diagnosis and negative at relapse (+/-) in three patients, and negative at initial diagnosis and positive at relapse (-/+) in two patients. Internal tandem duplications of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD) were +/+ in five patients, +/- in one patient, and -/+ in six patients. The p53 gene mutations were +/+ in two patients, +/- in one patient, and -/- in 25 patients. FLT3/ITD and mutant p53 at relapse were associated with short survival after relapse. These results indicate that relapse is frequently accompanied by molecular alterations that include the loss and/or acquisition of mutations. Thus relapse can be understood as clonal shift or collateral succession rather than clonal progression",

    "Abstract": "Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) shows chromosome 9p anomalies in 50% of cases. Based on reports that p16INK4A gene, located on this chromosomal arm, is frequently altered in aggressive lymphomas, we analysed for alterations of this gene in 27 cases of PMBL, which were part of a series of 32 PMBL cases that have been characterized for alterations in c-myc, p53, N-ras, bcl-1, bcl-2, bcl-6 and for Epstein- Barr virus (EBV) infection. Four cases showed p16INK4A gene anomalies, including three with promoter methylation and one homozygous deletion. Eight PMBLs showed c-myc rearrangements. Three additional cases showed sequence variations in the c-myc P2 promoter, two of which consisted of the same germline variation involving a novel polymorphic XhoI site. Four tumours contained p53 gene mutations and three had clonal EBV infection. One case had a bcl-6 rearrangement. In conclusion, our study shows that p16INK4, c-myc and p53 alterations occur in 15%, 25% and 13% of PMBLs, respectively. EBV monoclonality was found in 9% of cases, whereas no abnormality was detected in bcl-1, bcl-2 and N-ras. Thus, none of the common genetic aberrations seen in other types of non- Hodgkin's lymphomas appears to be stringently involved in the pathogenesis of this unique lymphoma type",

Five out of eight pleural fluids containing adenocarcinoma showed p53 immunostaining and two of these also showed polymorphisms on SSCP and a mutation on sequencing. None of the 10 benign pleural fluids showed immunostaining for p53 or polymorphisms on SSCP. We believe that the poor sensitivity of p53 gene mutation by SSCP is mainly due to DNA from the background reactive cells 'swamping' the mutant DNA. We do not advocate its use as a diagnostic aid",

    "Abstract": "Objective. We studied the molecular abnormalities involved in the pathogenesis of endocrine tumors of the uterine cervix. Methods. We obtained DNA from precisely microdissected archival tissue from 15 endocrine tumors of the uterine cervix, consisting of 5 carcinoids (1 typical, 4 atypical), 2 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, and 8 small cell carcinomas. We investigated the presence of high-risk (types 16 and 18) and intermediate-risk (types 31 and 33) human papilloma virus (HPV) sequences, TP53 and K-ras gene mutations, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 9 genes/chromosomal regions, including 3p14.2/FHIT, 3p14-p21, 3p21, 3p22-p24, 5q21-q22/APC-MCC region, 9p21/CDKN2, 11q23/MEN1, 13q/RB, and 17p/TP53. Results. HPV sequences were detected in 8 (53%) tumors, HPV 16 in 2 cases, and HPV 18 in 2 cases. LOH at 9p21 (43%) and localized 3p deletions (47%) were the most frequent allelic losses found. Allelic losses at 5q21-q22/APC-MCC region, 11q23/MEN1, and 13q/RB were infrequent. TP53 gene mutations were detected in 7 (47%) tumors (1 atypical carcinoid and 6 carcinomas). HPV sequences were demonstrated in 4 of the 7 cases with TP53 gene mutations. No K-ras mutations were detected. Conclusion. The molecular changes present in endocrine tumors of the uterine cervix have distinct features. They incorporate those present in the neuroendocrine tumors of the lung (high frequency of TP53 gene abnormalities and 9p21 deletions) with those detected in squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix (high-risk HPV sequences and localized 3p deletions).

    "Abstract": "P53 mutations are currently recognized as the most common genetic alteration in human tumors. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the significance and reliability of p53 genotyping in head and neck cancer as a possible marker permitting the prediction of tumor behavior and clinical outcome. P53 genotyping in our study refers to highly sensitive molecular screening in order to detect structural alterations in the nucleic acid sequence of the gene. Exons 2-11 and adjacent intronic regions were screened for mutations by direct genomic sequencing or by bi-directional dideoxyfingerprinting in 66 primary tumors of the larynx, pharynx and oral cavity. Alterations in the <hot spot region> of the p53 gene were detected in 36% (24 of 66) of the analyzed tumors, no mutation was found in our cohort outside exons 5-8. The frequency of p53 mutation had no correlation to the tumor stage or tumor site. The recurrence rate in patients with a p53 alteration was not significantly higher compared to patients without a p53 mutation in their primary tumors. Summarizing the results of our study only limited reliability of p53 genotyping as an effective concept for molecular testing of head and neck cancer was found",

    "Abstract": "AIM: To examine mesotheliomas for a possible relation between p53 immunostaining, p53 gene mutation, simian virus 40 (SV40), and asbestos exposure. METHODS: Paraffin sections from 11 mesotheliomas were used for p53 immunostaining and also to extract DNA. This was analysed for the presence of mutations in exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene using a 'cold' single strand conformational polymorphism method, together with sequencing. The DNA from the paraffin sections was also used to search for SV40 sequences. A 105 base pair segment at the 3' of the SV40 large T antigen (Tag) was targeted and any PCR amplification products were sequenced to confirm that they were of SV40 origin. EDAX electron microscopic differential mineral fibre counts were performed on dried lung tissue at a specialist referral centre. RESULTS: The fibre counts showed that seven of the mesotheliomas were associated with abnormally high asbestos exposure. Of these, two showed p53 immunostaining, none showed p53 gene mutation, and five showed SV40. Of the four other mesotheliomas, three showed p53 immunostaining, one showed a (silent) p53 mutation, and none showed SV40. The difference in frequency of SV40 detection was significant at the p < 0.05 level. CONCLUSIONS: Immunostaining for the p53 gene was relatively common but p53 mutations were rare in this series. SV40 virus sequence was detected in five of seven asbestos associated mesotheliomas but in none of the non-asbestos- associated mesotheliomas. This suggests there may be a synergistic interaction between asbestos and SV40 in human mesotheliomas. A study with a larger number of cases is needed to investigate these observations further",

    "Abstract": "Alterations to p53 seem to be of prognostic significance in soft tissue sarcomas, but their significance for synovial sarcomas has not been studied. We analysed 34 synovial sarcomas in 19 patients for p53 alterations (p53 gene mutations + p53 immunopositivity) and examined this factor for its prognostic value in a group of 15 primary tumours. DNA was prepared from paraffin-embedded tumour material by a modified proteinase K/phenol/chloroform extraction. p53 gene mutations of exons 5-8 were analysed by the PCR-SSCP-sequencing method. p53 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using the murine monoclonal antibody DO1. We found two missense mutations (5.9%) and ten p53 immunopositive cases (29.4%). Both tumours with p53 mutations showed p53 protein expression. There was no significant correlation between p53 alteration and histological subtype, age, sex, or tumour size. The 5-year survival rate was 24.1%. Overall survival was significantly reduced in patients having synovial sarcomas with p53 alterations (P<0.001). In the multivariate Cox's analysis, only p53 alterations (P=0.032) and tumour size (P=0.023) emerged as independent prognostic factors. We suggest that p53 alterations may be a useful prognostic indicator in synovial sarcomas, allowing rational clinical treatment and follow-up",

    "Abstract": "TP53 and MDM2 genes and their protein expression were evaluated in frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue from 27 patients with malignant fibrous histiocytoma to elucidate the relationship between them, their implication in tumor progression mechanisms and their possible diagnostic-prognostic value in malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA were used to establish two TP53 mutations (7.4%): a point mutation and a 63-bp duplication. Amplification of the MDM2 gene was observed in two tumors (7.4%) by means of Southern-blot analysis, one of them also carrying the TP53 point mutation. Immunohistochemical and Western-blot techniques were used to study nuclear accumulation of p53 and mdm2 proteins: 11 cases (40.7%) with p53 protein expression and thirteen cases (48.1%) with mdm2 protein expression were detected. We confirmed overexpression of mdm2 protein in eight of ten cases (80%) with p53 protein expression without TP53 gene mutation. Statistical analysis shows that simultaneous co-expression of p53 and mdm2 in malignant fibrous histiocytoma is significantly correlated with survival in absence of gene alteration in contrast to the lack of statistical correlation with survival of p53 protein expression alone",

    "Title": "Are There Low-Penetrance TP53 Alleles? Evidence from Childhood Adrenocortical Tumors",
    "Abstract": "We have analyzed a panel of 14 cases of childhood adrenocortical tumors unselected for family history and have identified germline TP53 mutations in >80%, making this the highest known incidence of a germline mutation in a tumor-suppressor gene in any cancer. The spectrum of germline TP53 mutations detected is remarkably limited. Analysis of tumor tissue for loss of constitutional heterozygosity, with respect to the germline mutant allele and the occurrence of other somatic TP53 mutations, indicates complex sequences of genetic events in a number of tumors. None of the families had cancer histories that conformed to the criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome, but, in some families, we were able to demonstrate that the mutation had been inherited. In these families there were gene carriers unaffected in their 40s and 50s, and there were others with relatively late-onset cancers. These data provide evidence that certain TP53 alleles confer relatively low penetrance for predisposition to the development of cancer, and they imply that deleterious TP53 mutations may be more frequent in the population than has been estimated previously. Our findings have considerable implications for the clinical management of children with andrenocortical tumors and their parents, in terms of both genetic testing and the early detection and treatment of tumors",

    "Title": "Immunofluorometric assay of p53 protein versus sequencing of p53 exons 5 to 9 for the detection of p53 abnormalities in ovarian carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "p53 alteration, detected as mutation of the p53 gene or as accumulation of mutant p53 protein, is a common feature of most malignancies, including ovarian carcinoma, and may identify patients with unfavorable prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Tumor tissues from 55 patients with well or poorly differentiated (grades 1 or 3) primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma were assessed both for p53 protein overexpression by a sensitive time-resolved immunofluorometric assay employing DO-1 and CM-1 antibodies, and for genetic p53 abnormalities by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified exons 5 to 9. Sixteen p53 mutations (29%), including 3 deletions causing frameshifts as well as one nonsense and 12 missense point mutations were found in all exons except exon 9. Overexpression of p53 protein, defined as a concentration exceeding the 75th percentile, was found in 15 cases (27%), 10 of which had missense mutations (P < 0.01). Tumors with nonsense and frameshift mutations were p53-negative by immunoassay. Both p53 mutation (P = 0.04) and p53 protein accumulation (P < 0.01) were associated with stage III-IV disease, while p53 mutation was more closely related to grade 3 lesions (P = 0.04) and serous histotype (P = 0.01). These results indicate that p53 protein accumulation correlates well with missense point mutation in carcinoma of the ovary and, together with other evidence that p53 abnormality may be prognostic of outcome in this disease, suggest that the immunoassay of p53 protein may have clinical value",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous reports indicate that the p53 yeast functional assay is a highly sensitive method of detection of p53 mutations in clinical specimens. Our earlier report (1) showed a 35.4% p53 mutation frequency in Hong Kong colorectal carcinoma (CRC) patients, when conventional molecular screening techniques were utilized to assess the mutation rate in the hot spots in exons 5-8. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The yeast functional assay was used to determine if the previous mutation frequency determined by PCR-SSCP techniques was under-estimated, and if so, to see if other hot spots for mutations explain this difference. RESULTS: The p53 functional yeast assay results showed an increased mutation frequency. However, sequencing showed the mutations were confined to common hot spots for mutations in exons 6 and 7. CONCLUSIONS: The mutation frequency in CRC patients observed with the yeast assay is higher than previously reported. Forty-five percent of 20 SSCP-negative specimens were positive by the yeast assay, which this study shows is superior for detection of p53 mutations directly in clinical specimens containing varying amounts of normal tissue contamination",

    "Title": "Prevalence of human papilloma virus DNA in head and neck cancers carrying wild-type or mutant p53 tumor suppressor genes",
    "Abstract": "The normal function of the p53 tumor suppressor protein can be perturbed by non-mutational mechanisms. The E6 protein encoded by high risk strains of human papilloma virus (HPV) targets the p53 protein resulting in enhanced degradation via the ubiquitin pathway. We have used nested PCR for detecting the presence of HPV DNA in 58 primary head and neck tumors and 15 metastatic lymph nodes, which had been prescreened for p53 mutations in exons 5 to 8. HPV DNA sequences were detected in 12 tumors (20.6%) and 4 metastatic lymph nodes (21%). HPV type 16 DNA was predominantly found in tumors (n = 11) and lymph nodes (n = 4), one tumor was positive for HPV type 18 sequences. Five of 12 HPV-positive tumors (41%) carried a p53 mutation. Of 46 HPV-negative tumors, 16 (34.8%) carried a p53 mutation. Thus, HPV positivity and p53 mutations were not mutually exclusive in head-and-neck cancer. Three of 6 normal tissues adjacent to the tumor were positive for HPV type 16, while no viral DNA was found in the corresponding tumors. Thus, the presence of HPV type 16 DNA did not directly confer a growth advantage on the population of emerging tumor cells. Instead, these tumors lack normal p53 function due to mutation",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: p53 and bax gene mutations were investigated by means of PCR/SSCP and direct DNA sequencing, and bax, bcl-2 and p53 protein expression by means of immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We identified p53 gene mutations in 17/50 cases (34%); p53 expression in 26 of the 50 cases (52%); bcl-2 expression in 5/50 cases (10%); bax expression in 32/47 cases (68%). 18/33 cases with a wild type p53 gene overexpressed p53 protein: 12 cases (approximately 66%) were bax+/bcl-2-. Of the remaining cases without p53 protein expression, seven cases (approximately 47%) were bax+/bcl-2-. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that the overexpression of p53 may contribute to the repression of bcl-2 and the induction of bax expression in LSCCs. However, the fact that a number of cases not expressing p53 did not present any clear up-regulation of bax or down-regulation of bcl-2 suggests that bcl-2 and bax may be regulated by various mechanisms other than p53",

    "Title": "TP53 mutations do not correlate with locoregional recurrence in stage I tongue carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The abrogation of the TP53 gene is considered to play a central role in the development of human cancers. Exons 5-8 harbor mutations most frequently, mainly of the missense type, resulting in accumulation of the p53 protein. The importance of these alterations as prognostic factors, are issues of controversy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients suffering from stage I tongue carcinoma had been treated with a local surgical excision of the tumor. Seventeen patients had developed a local recurrence in the tongue or cervical (regional) metastases while 17 patients, matched for age and gender to the former group, had no recurring disease within follow-up. Protein p53 was detected through immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis using antibody CM1. Exons 5-8 of the TP53 gene were amplified through the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The presence of mutations analyzed by CDGE (Constant Denaturant Gel Electrophoresis) and detected mutations were subjected to sequencing. RESULTS: 20 out of 34 tumors (59%) showed mutated TP53, 18 tumors were IHC p53 positive, but the correlation between CDGE and IHC was only 56%. Sequencing of the gene was possible in 8 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Neither the presence of mutations nor immunostaining had any impact on the risk of recurrence expressed as life-table analysis of time to recurrence",

In esophageal cancer cell lines, expression of GML mRNA, which was found to be significantly correlated with in vitro anti-cancer drug sensitivity, was observed only in the presence of wild-type p53. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The relationship between expression of GML mRNA and p53 gene status in 24 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines was examined using RT-PCR and PCR-SSCP followed by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Expression of GML mRNA was observed in only 3 of 24 cell lines. In contrast to previous studies showing p53-dependent GML expression, of the 3 cell lines expressing GML mRNA, one had a p53 gene mutation (codon 245: Gly to Cys). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the expression of GML mRNA is infrequent and regulated in a p53-independent manner in NSCLC",

    "Abstract": "In order to characterize p53 alterations in esophageal cancer and to study their roles in carcinogenesis, we performed gene mutation and immunohistochemical analysis on 43 surgically resected human esophageal specimens, which contain squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adjacent non- cancerous lesions, from a high-incidence area of Linzhou in Henan, China. A newly developed immunohisto-selective sequencing (IHSS) method was used to enrich the p53 immunostain-positive cells for mutation analysis. p53 gene mutations were detected in 30 out of 43 (70%) SCC cases. Among 29 SCC cases that were stained positive for p53 protein, 25 (86%) were found to contain p53 mutations. In five cases of SCC with homogeneous p53 staining, the same mutation was observed in samples taken from four different positions of each tumor. In a well differentiated cancer nest, p53 mutation was detected in only the peripheral p53-positive cells. In tumor areas with heterogeneous p53 staining, either the area stained positive for p53 had an additional mutation to the negatively stained area or both areas lacked any detectable p53 mutation. In the p53-positive non-cancerous lesions adjacent to cancer, p53 mutations were detected in seven out of 16 (47%) samples with basal cell hyperplasia (BCH), eight out of 12 (67%) samples with dysplasia (DYS), and six out of seven (86%) samples with carcinoma in situ (CIS). All mutations found in lesions with DYS and CIS were the same as those in the nearby SCC. In seven cases of BCH containing mutations, only three had the same mutations as the nearby SCC. The results suggest that p53 mutation is an early event in esophageal carcinogenesis occurring in most of the DYS and CIS lesions, and cells with such mutations will progress to carcinoma, whereas the role of p53 mutations in BCH is less clear",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in tumor and non-tumor tissues of thorotrast recipients: a model for cellular selection during radiation carcinogenesis in the liver",
    "Abstract": "Concerns over cancer development from exposure to environmental sources of densely ionizing, high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, such as alpha-particles from radon, is a current public health issue. The study of tumors attributable to high LET irradiation would greatly augment our insights into the biological mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Chronic low-dose-rate internal exposure to alpha-radiation from thorium dioxide deposits following intravascular administration of the radiographic contrast agent Thorotrast is known to markedly increase the risk of cancer development, especially that of hepatic angiosarcomas and cholangiocarcinomas. Although the mechanism is hypothesized to be via cellular damage, DNA being a major target, wrought by the high LET alpha-particles, the specific genes and the actual sequence of events involved in the process of transforming a normal cell into a malignant one are largely unknown. To shed some light on the molecular mechanisms of cancer development during a lifetime exposure to alpha-radiation, we analyzed the most commonly affected tumor suppressor gene in humans, p53, in 20 Thorotrast recipients who developed cancer, mostly of hepatic bile duct and blood vessel origin. Of the 20 cases, 19 were found to harbor p53 point mutations. Moreover, the accompanying non-tumor tissues from these patients also had p53 mutations, albeit at lower frequency. The distribution pattern of the point mutations was significantly different between the non-tumor and tumor tissues, with most mutations in malignant tissues located in the highly conserved domains of the p53 gene. Our results support the idea that p53 mutations are important in the genesis of Thorotrast-induced tumors but that these point mutations are a secondary outcome of genomic instability induced by the irradiation. Additionally, non-tumor cells harboring p53 mutations may gain some survival advantage in situ but mutations in the domains responsible for the formation of structural elements critical in binding DNA may be necessary for a cell to reach full malignancy",

    "Abstract": "AIMS: Oligodendroglial tumours follow genetic pathways different from but overlapping with those of astrocytic tumours. The aim of this study was to examine whether major genetic events such as loss of chromosome 10 and p53 mutation found in astrocytic gliomas are also involved in the development and anaplastic transformation of non-astrocytic gliomas and to correlate the findings with histopathological subtypes of these tumours. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-one formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded oligodendroglial and ependymal tumours (16 oligodendrogliomas, 12 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, seven oligoastrocytomas, 24 ependymomas and two anaplastic ependymomas) were examined for allelic deletions on chromosome 10q23 and 10q25-26 regions, mutations of PTEN/MMAC1 and p53, MDM2 gene amplification and apoptosis. The frequencies of allelic deletions at marker D10S2491 (which mapped within PTEN/MMAC1) and between markers D10S209 and D10S587 (where DMBT1 was located) were found to be < 30% in both types of non-astrocytic gliomas. High frequency of allelic deletions was detected at marker D10S215 (80%) at the proximal 10q23 region in both oligodendroglial and ependymal tumours and between markers D10S216 (42%) and D10S169 (67%) at distal 10q25-26 region in oligodendroglial tumours. No mutations of PTEN/MMAC1 were found. p53 mutations were detected in three oligoastrocytomas and one ependymoma; three out of five mutations were found in exon 4. MDM2 gene amplification was found in one ependymoma harbouring wild-type p53. The apoptotic index was lower in p53-mutated tumours than in tumours with wild-type p53. CONCLUSION: The telomeric end of chromosome 10q could be involved in the development and anaplastic transformation of oligodendroglial tumours. Mutations of PTEN/MMAC1 and p53, amplification of the MDM2 gene and allelic loss on chromosome 10q do not play a major part in the pathogenesis or anaplastic transformation of oligodendrogliomas and ependymal tumours",

    "Abstract": "AIMS: The significance of molecular and genetic alterations of p53 and ras in the development and progression as well as the histological differentiation of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) was evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined immunohistochemically ras p21 protein and p53-related products (p53 protein, WAF-1 and mdm-2) in 43 cases of ICC. In addition, point mutations of ras and p53 were examined genetically in selected ICC cases by polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and direct sequence analysis. Point mutation of K-ras gene codon 12 was detected in three of 14 cases and one of 15 cases by PCR-RFLP and direct sequence analysis, respectively. Immunoreactivity of ras p21 protein was not detected. Point mutation of p53 was detected in three of 15 cases. p53 protein was immunohistochemically detectable in 33 of 43 cases. Immunoreactivity of p53 was more frequent in well-differentiated and less frequent in poorly differentiated cases. Immunoreactivity of WAF-1 and mdm-2 was seen in 16 and eight of 43 cases, respectively. Both proteins were frequently detected in the cases positive for p53 protein. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that dysregulation of ras is involved in at least 20% of ICC and expression of p53 protein is more significantly involved in ICC, particularly in the well and moderately differentiated cases. While some cases of p53 expression may be explainable by point mutation of p53, there may be some epigenetic phenomena that stabilize p53 protein in ICC. That is, wild type p53 may be stabilized and then detectable by forming complexes with other molecules of p53 downstream effector genes, such as WAF-1 and mdm-2",

    "Abstract": "The transformation of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (t-CTCL) is an uncommon phenomenon that is associated with histopathologic changes and follows an aggressive course. The factors contributing to this transformation are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to analyze the p53 status in t-CTCL and to correlate it with disease outcome. The p53 status was investigated by immunohistochemistry, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing in 12 patients with t-CTCL. Eight mutations were detected; including four in exon 5, one in exon 6 and three in exon 7. Five were point mutations and three were deletions. Paired samples from nontransformed patch and plaque lesions showed no p53 over-expression. Eight disease-related deaths were reported, six to 23 months after transformation, all of which had p53 mutations. Three other patients with wild phenotype (WT-p53) were last reported alive with the disease 19-33 months after transformation (p < 0.0002). One other case had a p53 mutation but a short period of follow- up. Our results suggest that phenotypic changes of t-CTCL are frequently associated with genotype alterations in the p53 gene. Because 70% of the mutations detected were either G to C transversions or deletions, nucleotide-pairing mismatch and not DNA damage by UVB represents a likely mechanism for mutagenesis. Furthermore, the data may help in the design of gene transfer therapies that target the p53 molecule",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 may contribute to the transformed-appearing phenotype of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts. METHODS: We performed p53 gene mutation analysis using different molecular approaches. Synovial fibroblasts of 10 patients with RA were cultured and RNA and DNA were harvested after 3-5 passages in cell culture. Sequence analysis of all exons of the p53 gene was performed using 3 different techniques: 1) single-strand conformational polymorphism, 2) nonisotopic RNase cleavage assay, and 3) base excision sequence scanning T-scan, followed by sequence analysis of specific gene segments. RESULTS: Although p53 antigen could be detected by immunocytochemistry in numerous cultured fibroblasts, gel electrophoresis analysis of products obtained using all 3 methods and subsequent sequence analysis showed no specific mutation pattern in the genome of the synovial fibroblasts from patients in Germany, including the known 'hot spots' within the p53 genome. However, p53 mutations were identified in different clones of 3 additional RA synovial fibroblast populations from the United States. Sequence analysis of the p53 promoter did not reveal mutational base changes. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study support the hypothesis that the majority of the mutations of the p53 gene observed in RA synovium are not derived from the genome of RA synovial fibroblasts, and that the variability of the mutation pattern reflects, in part, the heterogeneity of the disease",

    "Abstract": "Although human lung tumor-derived cell lines play an important role in the investigation of lung cancer biology and genetics, there is no comprehensive study comparing the genotypic and phenotypic properties of lung cancer cell lines with those of the individual tumors from which they were derived. We compared a variety of properties of 12 human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines (cultured for a median period of 39 months; range, 12-69) and their corresponding archival tumor tissues. There was, in general, an excellent concordance between the lung tumor cell lines and their corresponding tumor tissues for morphology (100%), the presence of aneuploidy (100%), immunohistochemical expression of HER2/neu (100%) and p53 proteins (100%), loss of heterozygosity at 13 chromosomal regions analyzed (97%) using 37 microsatellite markers, microsatellite alterations (MAs, 75%), TP53 (67%), and K-ras (100%) gene mutations. In addition, there was 100% concordance for the parental allele lost in all 115 comparisons of allelic losses. Some discrepancies were found; more aneuploid subpopulations of cells were detected in the cell lines as well as higher incidences of TP53 mutations (4 of 10 mutations not found in the tumors) and microsatellite alterations (two cell lines with MAs not detected in the tumors). Similar loss of heterozygosity frequencies by chromosomal regions and mean fractional allelic loss index were detected between successfully cultured and 40 uncultured lung tumors (0.45 and 0.49, respectively), indicating that both groups were similar. Our findings indicate that the NSCLC cell lines in the large majority of instances retain the properties of their parental tumors for lengthy culture periods. NSCLC cell lines appear very representative of the lung cancer tumor from which they were derived and thus provide suitable model systems for biomedical studies of this important neoplasm",

    "Abstract": "Because of the difficulty in obtaining biopsy specimens from pancreatic cancer patients, K-ras mutation analysis in pancreatic juice has been used for specific diagnosis. But recently, false positives have been obtained with this method. To improve the genetic diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, detection of p53 gene mutation in pancreatic juice was studied. Pancreatic juice was sampled endoscopically. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis was used for p53 mutation analysis. Furthermore, K-ras mutations at codon 12 were also studied in the same pancreatic cancer patients. Of 26 cases of pancreatic cancer, p53 mutations were detected in 11 (42.3%). No mutations were seen in the cases with mucin-producing adenoma nor with chronic pancreatitis. K-ras mutations were detected in 84.0% of cases by RFLP analysis, which has high sensitivity, and in 65.3% by hybridization protection assay, which has high specificity. Using a combination assay with both genes, genetic abnormalities were detected in 92.0% by RFLP and 73.1% by hybridization protection assay including two cases in which p53 alone was positive by both methods. The specificity of p53 mutation for pancreatic cancer is very high. Therefore, simultaneous analysis of p53 and K-ras mutation is suggested to enhance the genetic diagnosis of pancreatic cancer",

    "Title": "Distant metastases in ovarian cancer: association with p53 mutations",
    "Abstract": "Distant metastases are unusual occurrences at presentation and during the progression of epithelial ovarian cancer. There are no good clinical predictors of this phenomenon. Because p53 dysfunction is common in ovarian cancer, we chose to investigate whether specific types of mutations predicted a predisposition to distant metastasis. We hypothesized that the complete absence of intact p53 protein as seen with p53 null mutations may be associated with an enhanced tendency to develop distant metastatic disease. The complete coding sequence of 130 tumor DNA samples was screened for p53 mutations by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis. Abnormal single-strand conformational polymorphism findings were correlated with the specific DNA sequence abnormalities and outcome. Ninety-four (72%) tumors carried p53 mutations. Sixty-two were missense mutations, and 32 were null mutations (6 nonsense mutations, 23 frameshift mutations, and 3 splice-site mutations). Twenty-eight patients were found to have distant metastases (pericardium, brain, parenchymal liver, spleen, or lung) either at presentation or during the course of their treatment. Distant metastases were nearly 8-fold more common in patients whose tumors carried a null mutation (66%) than in those with either missense mutations (8%) or wild-type p53 (8%; P<0.001). When a null mutation was present, 25% of the tumors were associated with distant metastases at initial diagnosis. No individual with wild-type p53 or a missense mutation in the tumor presented with distant metastasis. Tumors with null mutations were more likely to be associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.003), advanced stage (stage III/IV; P<0.001) and high grade (grade II/III; P<0.001), at presentation. These tumors progressed with distant metastases more swiftly than did tumors with either missense mutations (mean, 1.18 versus 2.71 years; P = 0.04) or wild- type p53 (3.57 years; P = 0.015). In contrast to the popular dogma, distant metastases in ovarian cancer do not necessarily result from prolonged treatment of disease. They may be predicted to occur early in the disease course due to a specific molecular genetic abnormality: null mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. These findings need to be carefully considered when choosing between regional versus systemic treatment modalities",

    "Title": "Patterns of p53 gene mutations in head and neck cancer: full-length gene sequencing and results of primary radiotherapy",
    "Abstract": "p53 gene alterations are common in head and neck cancers, but their prognostic value has not been clearly established. Despite evidence in other cancers that sequencing of the entire p53 coding region provides prognostic information, full-length p53 gene sequencing has rarely been performed in head and neck cancers. In this study, p53 was assessed in a series of 42 pretreatment biopsies from patients with laryngeal carcinomas by full-length gene sequencing and by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Associations among p53 genotype, protein expression, and local recurrence were assessed in 35 irradiated patients followed for a minimum of 5 years. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded biopsies, and exons 2-11 of the p53 gene were individually amplified by PCR and then directly sequenced. IHC was performed to detect mutant and wild-type p53 protein using the DO7 monoclonal antibody. p21 protein expression was assessed using the EA1 monoclonal antibody. Twenty genetic alterations were observed in 42 tumors (48%). Four of these alterations (20%) occurred outside exons 5-8. There was a significant association between p53 gene and protein status (chi2 = 4.18, P = 0.04), although the correlation was weak (phi coefficient = - 0.327). Although local relapse following radiation was significantly associated with nodal status, no correlations were observed between p53 status (gene or IHC) and local recurrence following radiation therapy, based on the Kaplan-Meier method. These results show that p53 mutations are common in laryngeal carcinomas and that a proportion occur outside traditionally examined regions. The lack of correlation between p53 status and local control suggests that this marker is not as powerful as traditional prognostic factors, such as lymph node status",

    "Title": "Molecular detection of neoplastic cells in lymph nodes of metastatic colorectal cancer patients predicts recurrence",
    "Abstract": "Disseminated disease, especially to the liver, constitutes the major risk of recurrence for colorectal cancer patients. However, successful resection can still be achieved in 25-35% of colorectal cancer patients with isolated metastases. To evaluate the clinical value of occult micrometastatic disease detection in lymph nodes, we tested genetic (K- ras and p53 gene mutations) and epigenetic (p16 promoter hypermethylation) molecular markers in the perihepatic lymph nodes from colorectal cancer patients with isolated liver metastases. DNA was extracted from 21 paraffin-embedded liver metastases and 80 lymph nodes from 21 colorectal cancer patients. K-ras and p53 gene mutations were identified in DNA from liver metastases by PCR amplification followed by cycle sequencing. A sensitive oligonucleotide-mediated mismatch ligation assay was used to search for the presence of K-ras and p53 mutations to detect occult disease in 68 lymph nodes from tumors positive for these gene mutations. Promoter hypermethylation at the p16 tumor suppressor gene was examined in both liver lesions and lymph nodes by methylation-specific PCR. Sixteen of the 21 (76%) liver metastases harbored either gene point mutations or p16 promoter hypermethylation. Twelve of the 68 lymph nodes were positive for tumor cells by molecular evaluation and negative for tumor cells by histopathology and cytokeratin immunohistochemistry, whereas none were positive for tumor cells by histopathology or negative for tumor cells by molecular analysis (P = 0.0005, McNemar's test). Moreover, in three patients with lymph nodes that were histologically negative at all sites, molecular screening detected tumor DNA at one or more lymph nodes. Survival analysis showed a median survival of 1056 days for patients without evidence of lymph node involvement by molecular analysis and 165 days for patients with positive lymph nodes by this approach (P = 0.0005). These results indicate that lymph node metastasis screening in colorectal cancer patients by molecular-based techniques increases the sensitivity of tumor cell detection and can be a good predictor of recurrence in colorectal cancer patients with resectable liver metastases",

    "Title": "Characterization of p53 mutations in colorectal liver metastases and correlation with clinical parameters",
    "Abstract": "The presence and type of mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene were determined in 40 patients undergoing curative hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal carcinoma. This represents the largest series in the literature on the screening of p53 mutations for liver metastases. The analysis was performed in exons 5-9 by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis followed by direct sequencing. Forty-five percent of tumors showed mutation in p53, and this was observed only in exons 5-8. Mutations at codon positions 167, 196, 204, 213, 245, 281, 282, 286, and 306; deletion of codon 251 and of the first nucleotide of codon 252; and Leu residue (CTC) insertion downstream codon 252 are reported for the first time in colorectal liver metastasis. Mutations at codon positions 163, 248, and 273 have been reported previously. Correlation of p53 status with clinical parameters showed that patients with mutated p53 had a statistically higher number of lesions when compared with patients with wild-type p53 (P<0.050). In particular, of patients with mutated p53, 41% had three or more metastases compared with 14% of patients with wild-type p53. Synchronous metastases were present in 70% of the patients with p53 mutations and in only 29% of patients with wild-type p53 (P<0.025). In addition, patients with p53 mutations are more likely to develop recurrence (73%) compared with patients with wild-type p53 (33%; P<0.001). Other factors considered, including preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level, bilobar distribution, and size of the lesion(s), did not show significant correlation with p53 status. These results suggest that p53 status might be an important prognostic indicator to predict the pattern and likelihood of treatment failure after hepatic resection",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Japan, the relative risk for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in renal transplants was about 80-fold higher than that in the general population. Depressed immune surveillance due to the use of immunosuppressive agents was considered to cause cancer. Before renal transplantation, a vast majority of patients received hemodialysis, a known causative factor for acquired cystic disease of kidney (ACDK). Because ACDK is also considered to predispose to RCC, at least two risk factors for cancer accumulate in renal transplants. METHODS: In our study, clinicopathological features together with p53 gene mutations were analyzed in 218 patients with RCC: 22 received dialysis followed by renal transplantation, 39 received dialysis alone, and 157 sporadic RCC. P53 mutations were analyzed on DNA extracted from paraffin- embedded specimens with use of single strand conformation polymorphism, followed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: RCC in transplants shared several clinicopathological features with those in dialysis patients, which included small size and multiplicity of tumor, relatively high frequency of presence of ACDK, and papillary type of RCC. p53 gene mutations were infrequent in RCC of any clinical setting. CONCLUSIONS: Atrophic kidney at the end-stage of renal failure and under dialysis have lesions of ACDK that might predispose to RCC in dialysis and transplant patients",

H-ras, and N-ras genes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing and by immunohistochemistry for p53. Exon 1 of K-ras was mutated in two samples of low-grade AC and a metastasis from one of these tumors (GAT12 and AGT12, respectively). No mutations in N-ras or H-ras were found. Mutations in exons 5 and 8 of the p53 gene were identified in a high-grade AC and a LCNEC. Positive immunostaining for p53 was present in three samples, with only one genotypic mutation shown (LCNEC). In conclusion, point mutations of the p53 gene were infrequent in these pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors, did not correlate in all samples with immunostaining, and were associated with the higher-grade tumors. Second, the presence of K-ras mutations seems to be associated with the higher-grade carcinomas. Third, N-ras and H-ras mutations were not found with these pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors",

    "Abstract": "A comprehensive mutation detection assay is described for the entire coding region and all splice site junctions of TP53. The assay is based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, which follows either multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) applied to DNA extracted from fresh or frozen tissue samples or nested PCR applied to DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue samples. In both instances, the analysis can be performed under a single set of conditions. When testing the assay on DNA from cultured lung cancer cell lines and from paraffin- embedded Dukes C colorectal carcinomas, significant TP53 mutations were observed at high frequencies in 15 of 16 lung cancer cell lines (94%) and in 21 of 30 paraffin-embedded tissue samples of Dukes C colorectal carcinomas (70%). A substantial proportion of these significant mutations occurred outside the evolutionary conserved region of TP53 in 4 of 16 lung cancer cell lines (25%) and in 11 of 30 paraffin-embedded colorectal carcinomas (37%). This underscores the importance of a comprehensive TP53 mutation analysis in those instances that TP53 mutation is taken into account for diagnostic and prognostic purposes",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colon cancer of the microsatellite mutator phenotype (MMP) exhibits significant genotype differences from cancer without the MMP. Twenty-nine MMP-positive gastric cancers were analyzed to clarify if these genotype differences were also associated with distinctive clinicopathologic features. METHODS: Alterations of p53, beta2- microglobulin (beta2M ), hMLH1, and hMSH2 genes were analyzed by using polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformational polymorphism, sequencing, microallelotyping, hypermethylation assays, and immunostaining. The results were contrasted with mutations in BAX, hMSH3, and hMSH6, genes target for the MMP. RESULTS: Tumors with the MMP had a significantly lower incidence of p53 gene mutations than the other tumors and often contained beta2M gene somatic mutations. Many tumors contained concomitant genetic and epigenetic alterations in DNA mismatch repair genes, hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH3, and hMSH6. Gastric cancer of the MMP was associated with well/moderate differentiation, distal location, and better survival. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of somatic alterations in microsatellite sequences and in cancer genes target for the MMP is useful for the classification of groups of gastric cancers with different prognosis. The results further support the concept that (gastric) cancer of the MMP represents a distinctive oncogenic pathway because the mutated cancer genes are usually different from those found in tumors without the MMP",

Aflatoxin B1 causes a specific point mutation in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene in exposed individuals. In Western populations, mutations of this gene seem to be less frequent. We have investigated the role of p53 mutations in tumorigenesis in British patients with HCC. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and mutational spectrum of the p53 gene in HCCs from British patients. METHODS: DNA from 170 HCCs, of well-defined etiology, in British patients was analyzed by single-stranded conformational polymorphism using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Mutations were then characterized by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent of tumors had p53 mutations. Ten of 14 (71%) hemochromatotic cancers had mutations within the p53 gene, and clustering of these mutations at codon 220 (A-G) was found in 5 cases; 3 others had T-A mutations. No clustering was found in HCCs with other etiologies. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations are more common than was thought in Northern European HCCs. This is the first demonstration of p53 mutational clustering in HCCs from hemochromatotic subjects",

    "Title": "Frequent p53 gene mutations in soft tissue sarcomas arising in burn scar",
    "Abstract": "Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the commonest malignancy that arises in burn scars, which frequently contain p53 mutations. Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) also develops, though less frequently, in burn scars. p53 gene mutations were analyzed in paraffin-embedded specimens from 5 patients with STS (4 males and 1 female) that had arisen in a burn scar, by means of polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) followed by direct sequencing. Age at burn injury ranged from 2 to 10 (median 3) years, and STS developed with a latent period ranging from 29 to 79 (median 60) years. Histologically, all were malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The PCR-SSCP revealed aberrant bands in 4 (80%) of 5 cases. Direct sequencing revealed a total of 11 mutations in these 4 cases: 1 case had a single mutation, 1 had 2 mutations, and 2 had 4 mutations. Every tumor had at least 1 mutation that changed an amino acid, which may have provided the selection pressure for expansion. Thus, there is a high frequency of p53 gene mutations in STS appearing in burn scars. p53 mutations were also frequent in pyothorax-associated lymphoma (PAL), a lymphoma that develops in patients with long-standing pyothorax, so p53 mutations might be frequent in malignancies that develop in chronic inflammatory sites",

    "Abstract": "Glomus tumors are significantly rare tumors of carotid body. The great majority of these tumors are benign in character. Here we present two brothers with hereditary glomus jugulare tumor who had consanguineous parents. Radiotherapy was applied approximately 8 and 10 years ago for treatment in both cases. Eight years later, one of these cases came to our notice due to relapse. The mutation pattern of p53, p57KIP2, p16INK4A and p15NK4B genes which have roles in the cell cycle, was analyzed in tumor samples obtained from the two affected cases in the initial phase and from one of these cases at relapse. The DNA sample obtained from the case in initial diagnosis phase revealed no p53, p57KIP2, p16INK4A or p15INK4B mutation. He is still in remission phase. Despite the lack of p53, p57KIP2, p16INK4A and p15INK4B mutation at initial diagnosis the tumor DNA of the other case in relapse revealed p53 codon 243 (ATG-->ATC; met-->ile) and p16 codon 97 (GAC-->AAC; asp-- >asn) missense point mutations. No loss of heterozygosity in p53 and p16INK4A was observed by microsatellite analysis of tumoral tissues in these cases. P53 and p16INK4A mutations observed in relapse phase were in conserved regions of both genes. No previous reports have been published with these mutations in glomus tumor during progression. The mutation observed in this case may due to radiotherapy. In spite of this possibility, the missense point mutations in conserved region of p53 and p16INK4A genes may indicate the role of p53 and p16INK4A in tumor progression of glomus tumors",

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates the prevalence of p53 gene mutations in prostate cancer in salvage prostatectomies after radiation failure using single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product. Findings were correlated with immunohistochemically (IHC) detectable p53 expression in residual prostate cancer. The usefulness of p53 as a marker of clinical outcome was evaluated. Thirty-three cases were available for molecular and immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemical stains for p53 were performed with clone DO7. PCR-SSCP for mutations in the coding region of p53 DNA (exons 4-9) was performed on all immunopositive cases and 12 of 23 immunonegative cases. All samples with an SSCP shift were sequenced for the respective exon. Patients were evaluated for biochemical failure for 1-82 months (median 38 months) following surgery. Immunohistochemical p53 reactivity was noted in 10 of 33 (30%) patients. Among p53 immunopositive cases SSCP shifts were seen in 7 of 10 (70%) samples with 5 of the 7 (71%) showing p53 mutations. Univariate analysis revealed abnormal expression of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry to be a significant predictor of poorer outcome (p = 0.025, log rank), however this was not independent of pathologic stage, surgical margin status and Gleason score. The presence of p53 gene mutations by PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing did not predict for outcome. In our study 30% of prostate cancers at the time of salvage prostatectomy after radiation failure expressed immunohistochemically detectable p53. PCR-SSCP and sequencing shows that not all of these cases have detectable mutations in the most frequent mutation sites (exons 4-9). Clinical failure is more common in the group of prostate cancer patients with abnormal p53 immunoreactivity",

    "Abstract": "There is evidence that the incidence of primary cutaneous lymphoma, like other forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is increasing, yet little is known of the pathogenetic events involved in this group of disorders. In this study we examine the frequency and spectrum of P53 gene mutations in a large series of primary cutaneous lymphomas, with particular emphasis on tumor stage mycosis fungoides, as it is in these cases that p53 overexpression has previously been reported. Sixty-six samples from 55 patients with primary cutaneous B cell and T cell lymphomas were analyzed for mutations in exons 5-9 of the P53 gene using polymerase chain reaction/single strand conformational polymorphism, and subsequent cloning and sequencing of genomic DNA. Fourteen separate P53 mutations were identified in blood, skin, and lymph node samples in 13 patients (24%). Twelve of 14 mutations occurred at dipyrimidine sites, eight resulting in C-->T transitions and one in a CC-->TT tandem base transition, a mutation spectrum strikingly similar to that reported in nonmelanoma skin cancer and characteristic of DNA damage caused by ultraviolet B radiation. In the subset of patients with mycosis fungoides, P53 mutations were identified in six of 17 patients with tumor-stage but in none of 12 patients with plaque-stage disease (Fisher's exact test p = 0.027). These data suggest a role for ultraviolet radiation in the pathogenesis of primary cutaneous lymphomas and a possible ultraviolet B-related step in the progression of mycosis fungoides from plaque to tumor-stage disease",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in the conserved regions (exons 5-9) of the p53 gene were investigated in 37 untreated human primary oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing analyses. P53 mutations were detected in 2 of 37 (5.4%) oral SCC cases. One tumor sample (case 23) showed a mis-sense point mutation at codon 177, changing CCC to CTC, which resulted in a substitution of proline to leucine in the p53 protein. The other tumor (case 33) had a point mutation at codon 266, changing GGA to AGA and causing a substitution of glycine to arginine in the p53 protein. These two patients with p53 mutations did not have an areca quid chewing habit. These results suggest that mutations in the p53 gene may not play a role in the pathogenesis of human oral SCCs in Taiwan. Recently, we have shown that positive p53 staining was observed in 47 of 81 (58%) cases of oral SCC. The discrepancies between positive p53 protein staining and the low prevalence of p53 mutation in oral SCCs indicate that other mechanism(s) are involved in p53 overexpression",

    "Abstract": "Overexpression and mutation of p53 in 46 primary endometrial carcinomas were determined comparatively with the status for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). Immunohistochemically p53 overexpression was found in 9 of 46 cases (20%), while eight kinds of mutations in that gene were detected in 7 of 46 endometrial carcinomas (15%), using polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism and subsequently direct sequencing method. Six of nine cases with p53 overexpression showed p53 mutation. All eight mutations showed single substitutions, and three cases in exon 4, one in exon 5, two in exon 6, and two in exon 7 were found. The cases with the p53 overexpression were significantly inversely related to that of ER or PR staining. Most endometrial carcinoma with p53 overexpression and/or mutation had a relatively poor prognosis and showed no reactivities of ER or PR",

    "Title": "Expression and mutation analysis of the p53 gene in astrocytoma",
    "Abstract": "The role of p53 gene mutations in the formation or progression of human astrocytic tumors is controversial. We studied the distribution pattern of p53 immunoreactivity and analyzed p53 gene mutations to define the significance of p53 gene mutations in astrocytoma tumorigenesis or malignant progression. Twenty-three astrocytic tumors were evaluated with immunohistochemistry, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, and sequence analysis. We also searched MEDLINE to collect data on p53 gene mutation frequencies in astrocytic tumors in order to evaluate the association of p53 mutations and tumor grade. Strong immunoreactivity with a diffuse clustering pattern was found in three of five glioblastomas and seven of 12 anaplastic astrocytomas. Three of four low-grade astrocytomas were immunonegative. The p53 immunopositive cells in the only positively staining low-grade astrocytoma in our study appeared sparsely scattered. The results of immunostaining suggested that clonal expansion was associated with astrocytoma progression. Mutations of the p53 gene were detected in four of the 23 astrocytomas (one glioblastoma and three anaplastic astrocytomas). In the genetic data analysis, 76 of 367 astrocytomas had p53 gene mutations. A significantly greater p53 gene mutation frequency was found in anaplastic astrocytomas or glioblastomas than in the low- grade astrocytomas. The results of these immunohistochemical and genetic studies support the view that p53 gene mutation is associated with the malignant progression from low-grade to high-grade astrocytomas rather than with tumor initiation or promotion",

    "Title": "Frequency of p53 mutations in breast carcinomas from Ashkenazi Jewish carriers of BRCA1 mutations",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast carcinomas occurring in carriers of BRCA1 gene mutations may have a distinctly different pathway of molecular pathogenesis from those occurring in noncarriers. Data from murine models implicate loss of p53 (also known as TP53) gene function as a critical early event in the malignant transformation of cells with a BRCA1 mutation. Therefore, breast tumors from BRCA1 mutation carriers might be expected to exhibit a high frequency of p53 mutations. This study examined the frequency of p53 mutations in the breast tumors of Ashkenazi Jewish carriers and noncarriers of BRCA1 mutations. METHODS: Tumor DNA from carriers and noncarriers of BRCA1 mutations was screened for mutations in exons 4 through 10 of the p53 gene by use of the polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the amplified DNA. Direct sequencing was performed on gene fragments that showed altered mobility in SSCP analysis. RESULTS: Mutations in the p53 gene were detected in 10 of 13 tumors from BRCA1 mutation carriers versus 10 of 33 tumors from non-carriers (two-sided P = .007). The p53 mutations were distributed throughout exons 4 through 10 and included both protein-truncating and missense mutations in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: A statistically significantly higher frequency of p53 mutations was found in breast tumors from carriers of BRCA1 mutations than from noncarriers, which adds to the accumulating evidence that loss of p53 function is an important step in the molecular pathogenesis of BRCA1 mutation-associated breast tumors. This finding may have implications for understanding phenotypic differences and potential prognostic differences between BRCA1 mutation- associated hereditary breast cancers and sporadic cancers",

    "Title": "Molecular detection of tumor cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with early stage lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conventional cytologic analysis of sputum is an insensitive test for the diagnosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We have recently demonstrated that polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular methods are more sensitive than cytologic analysis in diagnosing bladder cancer. In this study, we examined whether molecular assays could identify cancer cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. METHODS: Tumor-specific oncogene mutations, CpG-island methylation status, and microsatellite alterations in the DNA of cells in BAL fluid from 50 consecutive patients with resectable (stages I through IIIa) NSCLC were assessed by use of four PCR-based techniques. RESULTS: Of 50 tumors, 28 contained a p53 mutation, and the identical mutation was detected with a plaque hybridization assay in the BAL fluid of 39% (11 of 28) of the corresponding patients. Eight of 19 adenocarcinomas contained a K-ras mutation, and the identical mutation was detected with a mutation ligation assay in the BAL fluid of 50% (four of eight) of the corresponding patients. The p16 gene was methylated in 19 of 50 tumors, and methylated p16 alleles were detected in the BAL fluid of 63% (12 of 19) of the corresponding patients. Microsatellite instability in at least one marker was detected with a panel of 15 markers frequently altered in NSCLC in 23 of 50 tumors; the identical alteration was detected in the BAL fluid of 14% (three of 22) of the corresponding patients. When all four techniques were used, mutations or microsatellite instability was detected in the paired BAL fluid of 23 (53%) of the 43 patients with tumors carrying a genetic alteration. CONCLUSION: Although still limited by sensitivity, molecular diagnostic strategies can detect the presence of neoplastic cells in the proximal airway of patients with surgically resectable NSCLC",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in basal cell carcinomas arising in routine users of sunscreens",
    "Abstract": "Sun exposure histories were obtained from a series of patients age 35 or younger following diagnosis and removal of a basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The DNA was extracted from tumor biopsy samples derived from BCC of 10 patients who reported that they did not use sunscreens during youth (age 18 or younger) and 10 patients who routinely employed sunscreens during this age period. Exons 5-9 of the p53 gene were then amplified in three fragments from these samples using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach and screened for mutations using an RNA heteroduplex assay. All PCR products displaying evidence of a mutation were sequenced. It was found that 6 of the 10 patients who were not routine sunscreen users displayed mutations in these p53 exons. All of the mutations were located at dipyrimidine sites, five of the six were C-->T transitions and one mutation was a tandem double mutation, consistent with a role for solar UVB in BCC formation. In contrast, only one p53 mutation was detected in the group of 10 patients who routinely employed sunscreens during childhood and adolescence. Hence, a significantly (P = 0.029) lower level of p53 mutations was detected in the BCC obtained from sunscreen users compared with tumors derived from nonusers. These findings suggest that the mechanisms involved in the etiology of skin carcinogenesis differ in sunscreen users compared with people who did not routinely employ sunscreens. These data are also indicative of a protective effect associated with sunscreen use against the formation of p53 mutations. It is possible that the patients who were diagnosed with BCC despite their use of sunscreens possessed a genetic susceptibility for skin cancer formation and developed BCC through a p53-independent pathway. Alternatively, solar UVA wavelengths, that were generally not blocked by the suncare products employed by the sunscreen users, may have played a significant role in BCC development through induction of a mutation(s) in an oncogene and/or a tumor suppressor gene, other than p53, for these patients",

    "Title": "p53 mutations and expression in ovarian cancers: correlation with overall survival",
    "Abstract": "The p53 gene is altered in approximately 50% of all human malignancies. p53 overexpression, identified by immunohistochemistry, and p53 mutations, identified by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing, have been described in ovarian cancers. p53 overexpression has been correlated with poor outcome for women with ovarian cancer in some studies. With only limited data, the assumption has been made that p53 overexpression corresponds to p53 mutations. The purpose of this investigation was to assess p53 alterations in ovarian cancer to determine if p53 overexpression corresponds with mutations in the p53 gene, and to assess whether either predicts clinical outcome in ovarian carcinoma. Frozen ovarian carcinoma tumor specimens from 105 patients were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining for p53 expression. SSCP was used to screen for mutations and DNA sequencing was used to confirm the specific mutation in exons 2 to 11, encompassing the entire p53 open reading frame. Those ovarian carcinomas identified as wild-type p53 by SSCP were subjected to automated DNA sequence analysis of the entire open reading frame. Relative to DNA sequence analysis, the sensitivity of SSCP was 85% and the specificity was 98%. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that 72 of the 105 (69%) cases had positive immunostaining. SSCP and DNA sequencing identified and confirmed mutations in 60 of the 105 carcinomas (57%). Although there was a statistically significant association between p53 immunostaining and p53 mutations (p = 0.0002), false-negative and -positive results were identified. Tumor grade (p = 0.03), stage (p = 0.08), and overall survival (p = 0.15) were moderately associated with positive p53 immunostaining. Patients with p53 mutations and overexpression had shorter overall patient survival (p = 0.02). The findings demonstrated that, individually, p53 mutations and p53 overexpression were each related to shorter patient survival, but the strongest predictor of outcome was a combination of both mutations and overexpression. Comparisons of overall survival for women with mutations in loop 2, loop 3, and the loop-sheet-helix domains together showed a statistically significant difference in survival compared to survival of women whose ovarian cancers had other mutations (p = 0.046)",

    "Title": "The relation of p53 gene mutations to gastric cancer subsite and phenotype",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We investigated p53 gene mutations in advanced gastric cancers by direct DNA sequencing, in order to determine the frequency of mutations in gastric cancers having different epidemiological backgrounds, tumors of the cardia were compared with those arising in the antrum or corpus. Intestinal type cancers were compared with diffuse or other histologic types. We have chosen to assess the frequency of mutations solely based on DNA sequencing. METHODS: Paraffin embedded tissues from 100 gastric cancers were evaluated. The mutational status of the p53 gene in exons 5 through 9 were determined by direct sequencing of PCR products. RESULTS: Mutations in exons 5, 6, 7 and 8 were found in 35 of 100(35%)stomach cancers. One tumor had mutations in both exons 5 and 8. No mutations were detected in exon 9. p53 gene mutations were significantly more frequent in cancers of the cardia (19/35; 54%) than the antrum and corpus (16/65 (25%)) (p < or = 0.005). p53 mutations were more frequent in intestinal type cancers (28/67; 42%) than diffuse cancers or other histologic types of cancer (7/33; 21%), but the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Cancers of the cardia more frequently contain p53 mutations than do antral and corpus cancers, suggesting that cancers in the proximal and distal stomach evolve through different molecular pathways",

    "Title": "A comparative study of P53/MDM2 genes alterations and P53/MDM2 proteins immunoreactivity in soft-tissue sarcomas",
    "Abstract": "In the present study, the expression of P53 and MDM2 proteins were examined in 94 soft-tissue sarcomas (35 malignant fibrohistiocytomas, 15 neurosarcomas, 14 liposarcomas, 13 leiomyosarcomas, 11 fibrosarcomas and 6 dermatofibrosarcomas) by immunohistochemistry. The immunohistochemical findings were correlated with P53 mutation analysis using PCR-SSCP, PCR-HDF and direct sequencing, and MDM2 amplification studies by differential PCR. P53 immunopositivity was found in 25 out of 94 (26.6%) cases. Alterations of the P53 gene were detected in 12 (12.8%) tumors; eight of these tumors revealed P53 immunoreactivity. A high number of P53 positive and P53 mutated tumors were histologically defined as poorly differentiated G3 (64.0% and 75.0%, respectively). MDM2 immunopositivity was revealed in 36 out of 94 (38.3%) cases. MDM2 amplification occurred in 17 tumors (18.1%); only nine of these tumors exhibited MDM2 immunoreactivity. Overall, MDM2 positivity was not associated with MDM2 amplification in 27 out of 94 tumors (28.7%). There was no significant correlation between MDM2 overexpression and histological grade. However, when the samples were stratified by immunophenotype, the majority of tumors (52.5%) with isolated MDM2 overexpression (dissociated from P53 positivity) were defined histologically as low grade (G1 + G2). These results support the notion that besides P53 alterations, MDM2 gene deregulation seems to be an important event in sarcomas evolution. Additionally, the mechanism of MDM2-mediated degradation of P53 protein, without involving stabilization and inactivation of P53 gene, should be considered for better understanding of all features of tumor progression processes",

    "Title": "Sporadic p53 mutations and absence of ras mutations in glioblastomas",
    "Abstract": "As concerns human adult brain neoplasms, the biological behaviour of glioblastoma, a high-grade neuro-ectodermal tumour, is among the most disadvantageous. Glioblastoma may develop either as a primary tumour without clinical and histological evidence of a prior precursor lesion, or as the final stage of malignant transformation of a low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma. There are conflicting reports in connection with the association of the p53 tumour suppressor gene mutation with the clinical and histological progression of gliomas. Previous studies likewise led to contradictory results concerning the significance of ras oncogenes in different histological malignancies, and especially in neuro-epithelial tumours. The possible roles of p53 and ras gene alterations in the development of 'primary' and 'transformed' glioblastomas were studied in this work. Eighteen tumours were investigated by means of immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction-assisted-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) sequence analysis in a search for molecular genetic differences between primary and transformed glioblastomas. An increased incidence of p53- immunopositive cells was observed in both types of glioblastomas but there was no significant difference between the transformed tumours and the primary form. All samples were screened for point mutation in codons 12 and 61 of the H-, K-, and N-ras oncogenes and exons 5-8 of the p53 gene. No aberrant band or mutation was found in the H-, K- and N-ras oncogenes. Aberrant bands were seen in only 2 (11%) of the 18 tumours in the SSCP analyses of exons 6 and 8. Sequence analysis of the 2 abnormal cases revealed G --> C transmission in the second nucleotide of codon 280 on exon 8, which resulted in a change in the encoded amino acid from arginine to threonine (case 15). A ttagtct --> ttggtct transmission on intron 5 (case 8) was also found. No genetic difference could be identified between the primary and the transformed glioblastoma forms as concerns their p53 and ras oncogenes. There are two possible explanations for these findings: (a) The p53 and ras gene mutations were not primary events in the morphological transformations. Alterations in these genes may therefore take place at an early stage in glioma progression. (b) The different genetic changes may accumulate during glioblastoma development. These specific genetic events may additionally play a role in multistep tumourigenesis",

    "Title": "Mutation analysis of BRCA1, TP53, and KRAS2 in ovarian and related pelvic tumors",
    "Abstract": "Cancer may be viewed as a genetic disease resulting from critical mutations that disrupt normal cell growth. To characterize the involvement of the BRCA1 and TP53 tumor suppressor genes and of the KRAS2 protooncogene in gynecologic cancer, mutation analysis of these genes was conducted in pelvic tumors of 85 patients that included 49 epithelial ovarian carcinoma cases. The 85 pelvic tumors contained 5 tumors with BRCA1 mutations, 33 with TP53 mutations, and 1 with a KRAS2 mutation. Each of the BRCA1 and KRAS2 mutations, and 25 of the TP53 mutations, were in ovarian carcinomas. Four of the BRCA1 mutations were germline and 1 was somatic. The 4 patients with germline BRCA1 mutations had an early age of disease onset (33-48 years) relative to the mean age of onset (58 years) of all 49 ovarian carcinoma patients, and 3 of these 4 patients had a family history of ovarian or breast cancer. None of the 4 tumors with germline BRCA1 mutations had a KRAS2 mutation or a TP53 mutation, despite a 51% frequency of TP53 mutations in the 49 ovarian carcinomas. Three of the 4 tumors with germline BRCA1 mutations retained a wild-type BRCA1 allele. The tumor with the somatic BRCA1 mutation contained a TP53 mutation and had no evidence for wild- type BRCA1 and TP53 alleles. These data suggest that both BRCA1 and TP53 were inactivated in 1 of 49 ovarian carcinomas. Moreover, mutational inactivation of both BRCA1 and TP53 did not occur in 4 tumors with a germline BRCA1 mutation. It has been proposed that tumorigenesis in cells with a heterozygous BRCA1 mutation requires inactivation of the wild-type BRCA1 and TP53 alleles, which results in genomic instability and acquisition of mutations in protooncogenes. Clearly, mutational inactivation of TP53 and the wild-type BRCA1 allele in ovarian tumors with a heterozygous, germline BRCA1 mutation is not an absolute requirement for tumor formation. It is possible that these alleles may be inactivated by nonmutational mechanisms or that other tumor formation pathways exist",

    "Title": "Cumulation of TP53 mutations and p16INK4A/p15INK4B homozygous deletions in human papilloma virus type 16 positive scrotal cancer",
    "Abstract": "Scrotal cancer is the first described occupational cancer. The frequency of occupation-related scrotal cancer is very rare because of better hygiene and protective clothing. Human papilloma viruses (oncogenic types 16 and 18) were reported as the causative agents in the pathogenesis of scrotal cancers. E5, E6, and E7 proteins, expressed by human papilloma virus type 16, affect the cell cycle at the G1 checkpoint. TP53, p16INK4A, and p15INK4B were reported as the transcription factors that regulate the cell cycle on the same pathway. Here, the mutation pattern of TP53, p16INK4A, and p15INK4B genes and the homo/hemizygous deletion patterns of p16INK4A/p15INK4B genes are presented in four scrotal carcinoma cases. The results were correlated with the findings of oncogenic human papilloma viruses (types 16 and 18) in this panel. In two of four case, human papilloma virus type 16 was observed. Homozygous deletion in p16INK4A/p15INK4B genes and a codon 259 missense point mutation (GAC-->TAC; Asp-->Tyr) in the TP53 gene were observed in one human papilloma positive scrotal carcinoma case. The homozygous deletion in p16INK4A/p15INK4B genes was observed in another human papilloma positive scrotal carcinoma case. The cumulation of TP53 mutations and p16INK4A/p15INK4B homozygous deletions in human papilloma virus type 16 positive scrotal carcinoma cases indicate that the alterations of TP53, p16INK4A, and p15INK4B genes have an important role in the progression of scrotal cancers, as well as other factors. The survival rate for the two human papilloma virus type 16 positive patients who had a TP53 mutation or p16INK4A/p15INK4B homozygous deletion or both was lower than that for the human papilloma virus type 16 negative cases who had no TP53, p16INK4A, and p15INK4B mutation. The molecular alteration of TP53, p16INK4A, and p15INK4B genes may be useful as a prognostic marker in scrotal cancer",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the cyclin D1 mRNA expression level in ovarian tumor samples as compared with normal ovaries and to determine the relationship between cyclin D1 overexpression and p53 mutation status in ovarian tumors. METHODS: mRNA was isolated and cDNA was prepared from 27 epithelial ovarian tumors (3 tumors of low malignant potential (LMP) and 24 cancers) and 6 normal ovaries. The cyclin D1 sequences were amplified by using a thermal cycler in parallel with the beta- tubulin gene as an internal control. The cyclin D1 mRNA expression level relative to beta-tubulin was determined by 32P phosphoimager analysis. To confirm the overexpression of the cyclin D1 protein in ovarian tumor cells, immunostaining was performed. The p53 gene mutation status was examined by direct cDNA sequencing. RESULTS: mRNA levels of cyclin D1 were significantly higher in 21 (78%) of the 27 ovarian tumors than in normal ovaries. Cyclin D1 overexpression was detected in ovarian LMP tumors as well as in ovarian cancer cases. Positive immunostaining of cyclin D1 protein was observed in 10 of 18 (56%) ovarian tumors examined. p53 mutations were found in 11 (61%) of 18 ovarian tumors. Of 11 ovarian tumor cases with p53 mutations, 5 showed overexpression of cyclin D1. All 7 ovarian tumor cases without p53 mutations showed significant cyclin D1 mRNA overexpression. CONCLUSION: Cyclin D1 overexpression seems to be an early genetic event in ovarian tumor development. Although p53 may be one of the proteins whose function regulates the expression of G1 cyclins, ovarian tumors with no p53 mutation consistently showed cyclin D1 overexpression. Cyclin D1 overexpression may play an important role in the tumorigenesis of epithelial ovarian tumors",

    "Title": "Genetic changes during the multistage pathogenesis of human papillomavirus positive and negative vulvar carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify the molecular alterations found in 30 human papillomavirus (HPV) positive (n = 15) and negative (n = 15) vulvar carcinomas (VC) and their associated preinvasive lesions (VIN [vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia]) and normal epithelium to determine a common molecular pathogenesis of HPV positive and negative VC. METHODS: Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at seven 3p chromosomal regions (3p12, 3p14.2, 3p14.3-21.1, 3p21.3, 3p22-24, 3p24.3, 3p25), 13q14 (RB) and 17p13.1 (p53) loci, and TP53 gene mutations in microdissected archival tissues were investigated. RESULTS: Fourteen of fifteen HPV positive VC had HPV 16 DNA sequences. The fractional regional loss index (FRL), an index of total allelic loss at all chromosomal regions analyzed, was greater in the HPV negative VCs than in the HPV positive tumors (FRL = 0.55 versus 0.32; P = .048) and was also greater in the HPV negative high-grade VINs as compared with the HPV positive lesions (0.29 versus 0.02; P = .002). Overall, LOH at any 3p region was frequent (80%) in both groups of cancers and in their associated VIN lesions. Although TP53 gene mutations were present in a minority of VCs (20%), allelic losses at the TP53 locus were frequently present, especially in HPV negative VCs, as compared with the HPV positive tumors (62% versus 15%; P = .02). CONCLUSION: A greater number of molecular alterations are found in HPV negative VCs compared with HPV positive tumors. Allelic losses at 3p are common early events in vulvar carcinogenesis in HPV negative cancers detected at a high rate in the corresponding high-grade precursor lesions (VIN II/III). TP53 gene mutations with associated 17p13.1 LOH are more common in HPV negative cancers",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: There is a high prevalence of G-->T transversions of p53 in lung cancers of smokers. One study has reported a special 'hotspot' mutation at codon 249 of p53 in lung cancers of former uranium miners. The aim of our study was to look for mutational spectra of p53 in former German uranium miners with lung cancers. METHODS: We investigated 16 patients with lung cancer who had worked as uranium miners in Germany and 13 lung cancer patients without a mining history of the same region. By means of the polymerase chain reaction and sequencing we looked for mutations in exons 5 7 of the p53 gene. RESULTS: We could not find any suggestion of hotspot mutations. The only G-->T mutation in former uranium miners was detected in the only nonsmoker. In 3 patients (19% of the total) we found a codon 213/3 polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that G-->T transversions do not seem to be very common mutations in p53 in lung cancers probably caused by radiation. Therefore, p53 may be mutated early in lung cancer development if radiation exposure is a critical factor in carcinogenesis. In accordance with studies of thyroid cancer patients in the Chernobyl region, our results may indicate an overrepresentation of codon 213/3 polymorphism in p53 in radiation- caused cancers",

    "Abstract": "Using different molecular techniques, DNA has been shown to be present in plasma of patients with several types of tumors. Mutations of TP53 are the most common genetic changes in human cancers. We investigated the presence of TP53 gene mutations in plasma DNA of breast and small cell lung cancer patients. Tumor and plasma DNA of 25 patients were studied by PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing, through exons 5, 6, 7, and 8, of TP53. Six cases of mutations in tumor DNA were observed that, in 3 cases (50%), were also identified in plasma of the same patients. Mutations of the TP53 gene are seen in plasma DNA of cancer patients, and may prove to be a useful new tool in the management of these patients",

    "Title": "Molecular analysis of microdissected de novo glioblastomas and paired astrocytic tumors",
    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) often displays morphological heterogeneity in that low-grade (LG) area with well-differentiated cells are commonly found adjacent to high-grade (HG) area with poorly- differentiated cells. This heterogeneity may cause difficulty in obtaining representative tumor samples. Nevertheless, the genetic composition of these cells has only been occasionally examined. In the present study, we examined 29 de novo glioblastomas in which distinct LG and HG areas of sufficient volumes could be identified. These areas were microdissected from paraffin-embedded tissues and analyzed for genetic alterations: p53 mutations and immunohistochemistry; allelic losses at 17p13.1, 9p21, and 10q23-25; and amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and immunohistochemistry. We also examined 14 paired astrocytic tumors, in which a primary Grade II astrocytoma progressed over a period of time to a Grade III or Grade IV tumor. Our findings showed that the LG areas of the de novo glioblastomas exhibited numerous genetic aberrations, the proportion of which was increased in the HG areas. Genetic abnormalities seen in the LG areas were conserved in the HG areas suggesting that these morphologically different cellular subsets were derived from a common transformed clone. Also, the LG areas were genetically different from Grade II astrocytomas of the paired tumor group, in spite of their morphological similarity. In particular, the LG areas had more deletions on 10q23-25 (75% vs 20%, p = 0.04), but fewer p53 mutations (24% vs 71%, p = 0.003) and less p53 protein labeling (45% vs 79%, p = 0.04). These differences suggest that LG and HG areas in de novo glioblastoma are genetically closer to each other compared with paired low- and high-grade tumors that have progressed over time. Moreover, only a small proportion (17%) of our de novo glioblastomas exhibited EGFR amplification while a high proportion (62%) showed either p53 mutations or allelic loss of 17p13.1. We speculate that some de novo GBMs with copious LG areas may constitute a separate group with rapid progression from Grade II astrocytomas",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The cytotoxic effects of cisplatin and anthracyclins have been attributed to apoptosis induction, which has been recognized as a major function of the TP53 gene. The TP53 gene appears to be mutated in about 50% of cases of non-small cell lung cancer. A possible dependence of chemotherapy response on TP53 genotype was evaluated retrospectively in a group of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and induction treatment. METHODS: Patients with complete or partial remission were compared with those with stable or progressive disease with respect to TP53 genotype and overall survival. Mutations in the TP53 gene were detected by complete direct sequencing (exons 2-11). RESULTS: A normal TP53 genotype proved to be significantly associated with major response to chemotherapy (P <.001). Overall, no association was found between p53 protein expression and TP53 genotype. A normal TP53 genotype was found to be highly sensitive in predicting response to treatment, whereas a mutant genotype was revealed to be specific in predicting lack of response. The difference in overall length of survival was significant between patients exhibiting a normal TP53 genotype (corresponding to those whose disease responded to chemotherapy) and patients showing mutant TP53 genotype (corresponding to those who had disease resistant to chemotherapy, P =.027). CONCLUSIONS: In a small cohort of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer we found a direct link between normal TP53 genotype and response to cisplatin-based induction treatment and also between mutant genotype and resistance to treatment, whereas p53 immunohistochemical result was predictive of neither",

    "Abstract": "We have studied 27 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) to identify possible relationships between microsatellite instability (MSI), p53 mutations, and HBV infection in hepatocarcinogenesis. MSI was assessed using 19 polymorphic markers and the poly(A) tract BAT-26. All coding regions of p53 were examined for mutations. Tumors were also examined for presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA sequences; 66.6% of the samples exhibit MSI in at least one microsatellite locus and 44% in two or three loci. None of the tumors examined showed alterations in BAT- 26. Moreover, 73.3% of samples with indication of HBV infection showed instability in at least one marker. No association between MSI and pathological profile was found. Five (18.5%) samples harbored mutations in p53, three missense, and two insertions, all in exons 5 and 8 not previously reported. No mutations were detected in codon 249, which has been linked with dietary intake of aflatoxins. Our results support the hypothesis that HCC is a 'low' MSI tumor. Only 1/5 samples with MSI in more than two markers harbored a mutation in p53. Although the number of samples is too small to support a statistical significance, this finding may indicate an inverse relationship between p53 mutations and MSI in HCC",

    "Abstract": "The p53 gene was sequenced in 100 primary human lung cancers by using direct dideoxynucleotide cycle sequencing and compared with sequence analysis by using the p53 GeneChip assay. Differences in sequence analysis between the two techniques were further evaluated to determine the accuracy and limitations of each method. p53 mutations were either detected by using both techniques or, if only detected by one technique, were confirmed by using mutation-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. Dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the conserved regions of the p53 gene (exons 5-9) detected 76% of the mutations within this region of the gene. The GeneChip p53 assay detected 81% of all (exons 2- 11) mutations, including 80% of the mutations within the conserved regions of the gene. The GeneChip assay detected 46 of 52 missense mutations (88%), but 0 of 5 frameshift mutations. The specificity of direct sequencing and of the p53 GeneChip assay at detecting p53 mutations were 100% and 98%, respectively. The GeneChip p53 assay is a rapid and reasonably accurate approach for detecting p53 mutations; however, neither direct sequencing nor the p53 GeneChip are infallible at p53 mutation detection",

    "Title": "Lung cancer and past occupational exposure to asbestos. Role of p53 and K-ras mutations",
    "Abstract": "Studies on somatic mutations in lung cancers associated with cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure are few. We investigated prevalence of mutations in the p53 and K-ras genes in lung tumors from smokers with and without asbestos exposure at work. For K-ras mutations, the study was an extension of an earlier analysis. Nearly all of the 105 consecutive patients examined were smokers and had non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung with squamous-cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma histology. Exposure to asbestos was estimated by pulmonary fiber counts and occupational histories. A pulmonary burden of >/= 1 x 10(6) asbestos fibers per gram of lung tissue, indicating work-related exposure, was found in 32% of the patients for whom fiber-analysis data were available (33 of 102 patients, all men). The statistical analysis showed pulmonary fiber count as the only significant predictor of adenocarcinoma histology, in contrast to squamous-cell carcinoma (smoking-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 8.5). The frequency of p53 mutations was 39% (13 of 33) among the asbestos-exposed cases, as compared with 54% (29 of 54) among the nonexposed cases; the difference was not significant, however. In male ever-smokers, a long duration of smoking was associated with p53 mutation (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 8.8). In adenocarcinoma, p53 mutations were less prevalent (10 of 30, 33%) as compared with squamous-cell carcinoma (28 of 46, 61%; P = 0.02), whereas a strong and significant association was found between adenocarcinoma and K-ras mutation (OR 37, 95% CI 5.8 to 232, adjusted for smoking and asbestos exposure). Asbestos exposure alone was not significantly associated with increased occurrence of K-ras mutations. In conclusion, the results may primarily reflect the observed excess of adenocarcinoma in the asbestos- exposed patients, and hence the decrease in p53 mutations and increase in K-ras mutations",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the correlation between p53 protein levels and mutations in the p53 gene of atypical bronchial epithelium (ABE). Protein levels were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, whereas mutations were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing. A total of 78 formalin- fixed, paraffin-embedded bronchial biopsy specimens that had been diagnosed to be ABE were retrieved from the archives and examined. p53 protein was expressed in 44 of the 78 (56%) specimens overall. However, when pathologically classified, 38% of hyperplasias, 58% of metaplasias, and 73% of dysplasias were positive, indicating that an increased frequency of p53 expression correlated with the severity of ABE (P = 0.042). Among the 44 specimens that expressed p53 protein, 40 (91%) did not reveal mutations by PCR-SSCP. In the four specimens with abnormal PCR-SSCP bands, p53 gene mutation was identified by direct sequencing and revealed the same point mutation at codon 248 (CGG-to- CTG transversion) of exon 7 in all four specimens. These four specimens were dysplasias derived from patients with lung cancer. p53 protein expression in ABE was associated with the wild-type gene in most cases; therefore, wild-type p53 protein expressed in ABE might have a protective function from lung carcinogenesis, and mutation of p53 gene may be a late event in the sequential steps of lung carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "[p53 tumor suppressor gene mutation and prognosis in 105 cases of bladder cancer--the relationship between mutation of the p53 gene with clinicopathological features and smoking]",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Alterations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most common genetic change detected in human cancers. The incidence of p53 gene mutation in bladder tumor patients were studied and were compared with clinicopathological findings, smoking history and prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) was used for analysis from exon 4 to 9 of p53 gene in 105 cases of primary bladder tumors. RESULT: p53 matations were detected in 38 or 105 patients (36.2%). Kaplan-Meier Survival curves fo groups wit or without p53 gene mutation show a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0098). The mutation of p53 gene in stages pT 1 pT 1. pT 2, pT 3, pT 4 was found in 2 of 12 (16.7%), 8 of 32 (25.0%), 10 of 25 (40.0%), 12 of 20 (60.0%), 6 of 16 (37.5%) and in grades I, II, III, was noted in 1 of 17 (5.9%), 16 of 49 (32.7%), 21 of 39 (53.8%) cases, respectively. Significant differences were found for groups with grade I and grade II-III (p = 0.0045) cancers and in cases of superficial (stage pTa-1) and muscle-invasive (pT 2-4) tumors (p = 0.0148). However, mutation of p53 was not related to either age or sex in 105 patients. Recurrence rates in stage pTa-1 superficial tumor group with or without p53 mutation showed a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0419). No statistically significant difference was noted between p53 mutation and habitual smoking as well as durations of smoking. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations occur more commonly in higher grades and later stages of bladder tumors. Our results suggest that the prognostic factor is linked to not only histological findings but also to the presence of p53 mutation. The mutations of the p53 gene may be involved in the late events of tumorigenesis and might be used as good molecular markers for prognosis in bladder tumor",

    "Title": "Comparison of mutations in the p53 and K-ras genes in lung carcinomas from smoking and nonsmoking women",
    "Abstract": "Lung cancer incidence is increasing in women with little or no tobacco exposure, and the cause of this trend is not known. One possibility is increased sensitivity to environmental tobacco smoke in women nonsmokers diagnosed with lung cancer. To determine whether mutations associated with tobacco exposure are found in the lung tumors of women who are lifetime nonsmokers or occasional smokers, we compared the p53 and K-ras mutational spectra in lung carcinomas from 23 female nonsmokers, 2 female occasional smokers (< 10 pack-years), and 30 female long-term smokers (20-100 pack-years). We also looked for p53 and K-ras mutations in three carcinoid lung tumors, two from female nonsmokers and one from a female occasional smoker. For the p53 gene, exons 4-8 were examined for mutations; for the K-ras gene, exon 1 was examined. No mutations were found in the carcinoid tumors. In lung carcinomas, p53 mutations were identified in six (26.1%) of the cases from lifetime nonsmokers and consisted of five transitions (including three C to T, one G to A, and one T to C) and one T to A transversion. In comparison, p53 mutations were identified in 10 (31.3%) of the 32 lung carcinomas from short-term and long-term smokers and consisted of six transversions (four G to T, one A to T, and one G to C), one A to G transition, one C to T transition, and two deletions of one to four bp. Mutations in the p53 gene found in nonsmokers also occurred in either different codons or different positions within a codon compared with those seen in long-term smokers. K-ras mutations in codon 12 were identified in two lung carcinomas (8.7%) from lifetime nonsmokers. The K-ras mutations found were a G to T transversion and a G to A transition. Eight (25%) of the 32 lung carcinomas from smokers contained K-ras mutations in codons 12 and 13 (four G to T transversions and four G to A transitions). In addition, six silent mutations that are most likely polymorphisms were found in both smokers and nonsmokers. These results confirm that K-ras mutations are more frequent in smokers than in nonsmokers, but that the same type of mutation in the K-ras gene is found in both groups. In contrast, although the frequency of mutation in the p53 gene was similar in lifetime nonsmokers compared with long-term smokers, the types and spectra of mutation are significantly different. Two of the C to T transitions found in nonsmokers, but none of those found in smokers, occur at the C of a CpG site. These results suggest the mutagen(s) and/or mechanisms of p53 mutations in women nonsmokers are different from those responsible for p53 mutations in women smokers, which are probably largely induced by tobacco mutagens",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in lung cancer associated with residential radon exposure",
    "Abstract": "Unusual mutation patterns in lung tumors among underground miners have been indicated, suggesting radon-specific alterations in the genome, but the data are not consistent.  To investigate the association between residential radon exposure and p53 mutations in lung tumors, we performed a study on cases from a nationwide population-based investigation in Sweden.  Our study included 83 nonsmoking lung cancer cases and 250 smoking lung cancer cases, diagnosed 1980-1984 with a time-weighted average radon exposure over 140 Bq/m3 or up to 50 Bq/m3.  Radon was measured in dwellings occupied by the study subjects at some time since 1947.  Information on smoking habits and on the risk factors was obtained from questionnaires.  After exclusions because of the initiation of treatment or insufficient material, the p53-status of 243 tumors was determined using PCR-single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing determination of exons 5-8. The overall mutation prevalence was 23.9%.  An increased mutation prevalence was suggested among those with high exposure to residential radon [odds ratio (OR), 1.4; 95% CI, 0.7-2.6], especially among nonsmokers (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 0.7-15.5), but no specific mutational pattern was indicated. Furthermore, the mutation prevalence seemed to be higher among smoking lung cancer cases than among nonsmoking cases (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 0.9-5.0), and particularly among those smoking less than 10 cigarettes per day.  It may be concluded that residential exposure to radon seems to contribute to a higher mutation prevalence of the p53 gene in lung tumors.",

    "Abstract": "GM1492 human diploid skin fibroblasts derived from a patient with Bloom's syndrome (BS), lack detectable p53 mRNA and protein as shown by Northern and Western blotting, and express an increased RecA-like activity. Here we demonstrate that the p53 gene is grossly intact in GM1492 cells according to Southern blotting. DNA sequencing did not reveal any mutations in the promoter region of p53. A highly sensitive RT-PCR produced a p53 cDNA fragment that was shorter than expected. DNA sequence analysis of p53 cDNA showed that exon 6 was missing, explaining the shorter PCR product. Furthermore, sequencing of genomic DNA revealed a base substitution at the nucleotide preceding the AG splice acceptor site of intron 5. The omission of exon 6 creates a frameshift at the junction of exons 5 and 7, and a premature stop codon in exon 7. The aberrant transcript is predicted to encode a truncated p53 protein containing 189 amino acid residues. Moreover, Western blotting demonstrated elevated HsRAD51 protein levels in GM1492 cells. The lack of sufficient levels of wild-type p53 and increased levels of HsRad51 protein may contribute to the elevated RecA-like activity in the GM1492 fibroblasts",

    "Title": "Extrapleural solitary fibrous tumor: clinicopathologic study of 17 cases and molecular analysis of the p53 pathway",
    "Abstract": "Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) occurring at various extrapleural sites is sometimes difficult to diagnose because of its histologic variability. Although a solitary fibrous tumor is usually a slow-growing tumor with favorable prognosis, a small number of malignant cases have been reported. In the present study, we examined the clinical behavior, histologic, immunohistochemical and molecular features of 17 cases of extrapleural SFT. Four tumors were located in the pelvic cavity, two in the nasal cavity, two were confined to the pulmonary parenchyma, and there was one each in the meninges, kidney, mediastinum, retroperitoneum, temporal region, neck, groin, buttock and thigh. Histologically, all the tumors were characterized by the presence of areas consisting of a proliferation of bland spindle cells with variable amounts of thick, often hyalinized or keloid-like intercellular collagen bundles. Highly cellular areas were observed in three tumors, frequent mitoses in two, and cellular pleomorphism and tumor necrosis in one each. All 17 tumors showed immunoreactivity to CD34 and 15 (88%) to bcl-2 protein. The labeling indices of p53, mdm2 protein and Ki-67 were generally low. PCR-SSCP and a subsequent sequence analysis of the p53 gene disclosed point mutation at codon 161 in exon 5 in one of the 13 cases analyzed. According to follow-up information, none of the patients had developed local recurrence or distant metastasis. Our results suggest that most extrapleural SFTs behave in a benign fashion even in a higher histologic grade group, and it is difficult to predict their clinical outcome. Complete surgical excision in order to obtain clear margins and long-term follow-up is advisable for patients with an extrapleural SFT",

    "Title": "The origins of multiple squamous cell carcinomas in the aerodigestive tract",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemoprevention and cessation of smoking and alcohol may prevent development of multiple tumors (MTs) in the aerodigestive tract if new MTs arise independently, but they are of no benefit if MTs are due to migration of an already transformed clone of tumor cells. This issue was addressed in this study by investigation of the clonality among MTs. METHODS: Mutation analysis of the entire coding region of p53 and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) pattern analysis of microsatellite markers on chromosome arms 3p, 9p, and 17p are promising for the investigation of clonality. In the first part of this study, the authors established the variability and stability of these clonal markers by comparing primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) with their metastases. In the second part of this study, the authors evaluated nine patients with multiple HNSCCs using these markers. In the final part, the authors illustrate the use of these clonal markers in 11 patients for whom there was diagnostic uncertainty as to whether their second squamous cell carcinoma was either a new primary tumor, a metastasis, or a recurrence. RESULTS: Both p53 gene mutations and LOH patterns were stable during tumor progression. Furthermore, the variability of p53 gene mutations was high. More than 90% of the tumors contained a p53 mutation. A particular mutation never occurred more than twice in a total of 69 primary HNSCCs. Five of 69 cases presented a common mutation. In contrast, LOH patterns showed less variability; they were identical in 5 of 16 cases. The metachronous HNSCCs from nine patients all showed different p53 mutations, and in the three cases that were subjected to LOH analysis different patterns were observed. All 11 patients for whom there was diagnostic uncertainty about the origin of their second squamous cell carcinoma could be categorized as having multiple primary tumors, disseminated disease, or recurrent disease. CONCLUSIONS: Metachronous HNSCCs at different locations are not clonally related and thus have not developed from the migration of tumor cells. Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society",

    "Title": "p53 mutation pattern in hepatocellular carcinoma in workers exposed to vinyl chloride",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vinyl chloride (VC) is a known animal and human carcinogen that is associated with liver angiosarcoma and most likely also with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in humans. METHODS: The authors examined the presence of p53 gene mutations in 18 HCC specimens from patients with known exposure to VC (median, 8883 parts per million-years; median duration, 245 months). In all cases, other risk factors for the development of HCC (hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections, alcohol consumption, and metabolic or autoimmune disorders) were excluded. Three patients had concomitant cirrhosis. The p53 gene was examined by direct sequencing of exons 5-9. RESULTS: Mutations of the p53 gene were found in 11 of 18 HCCs examined. The point mutations detected were comprised of five transversions and five transitions. Five of 11 mutations (codons 175, 245, 248, 273, and 282) occurred at CpG sites. Histopathologic liver alterations (mild sinusoidal dilatation, [portal] fibrosis, and centrilobular siderosis) in tumor surrounding nonneoplastic liver confirmed exposure to VC. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicated a relation between VC exposure and the development of HCC. The mutation pattern of p53 with a nearly equal rate of incidence of transitions and transversions and a high rate of incidence of mutations at CpG sites may reflect endogenous mechanisms (e.g., deamination of 5-methylcytosine) rather than exogenous carcinogens.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Specific mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been reported from several parts of the world, but to the authors' knowledge to date the status of this gene has not been studied in HCC patients in India, where HCC is one of the major cancers and the frequency of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) as well as hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and exposure to dietary aflatoxin B(1) is very high. The most frequent mutation of the p53 gene in HCC is an AGG(Arg) to AGT(Ser) missense mutation at codon 249 of exon 7. METHODS: Liver biopsy specimens from 21 HCC patients and 10 healthy controls were obtained through surgery or by needle biopsy technique. Phenol-chloroform-extracted DNA specimens were employed for the detection of HBV infection and p53 gene mutations. Nucleotide mutations of exons 4-9 of the p53 gene were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single strand confirmation polymorphism, and direct sequencing. Third-generation sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for the serologic detection of HBV and HCV infection. RESULTS: Analysis of exons 4-9 of the p53 gene revealed only 3 mutations (3 of 21 specimens, 14.28%; 95% confidence interval, -0.7-29.3), 2 mutations at codon 249 showing G-->T transversions, and 1 mutation (4.7%) at codon 250 with a C-->T transition. The base substitutions at the third base of codon 249 resulted in a missense mutation leading to a change in amino acid from arginine to serine whereas at codon 250 it caused a change from proline to serine. Dot blot hybridization and PCR for HBV DNA from HCCs revealed 58.8% (10 of 17 specimens) and 90. 47% (19 of 21 specimens), positivity, respectively. ELISA for hepatitis B virus surface antigen in serum showed a positivity of 71. 42% (15 of 21 specimens), but there was only 40% positivity (8 of 20 specimens) for hepatitis B virus envelope antigen whereas 6 of 17 patients (35.29%) showed the presence of antibodies against hepatitis B virus envelope protein. No patient was found to be positive for the HCV antibody. CONCLUSIONS: The very low frequency of p53 mutations and the extremely high frequency of HBV infection (> 90%) in HCC indicate that the mutations in the p53 gene frequently found in HCC reported from different endemic areas of the world may not play a direct role in the development of HCC in India. HBV infection and, possibly, exposure to the dietary aflatoxin B(1) appear to play major roles in the molecular pathogenesis of HCC in India. Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society",

    "Title": "p53 mutations do not predict response to paclitaxel in metastatic nonsmall cell lung carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In vitro data and animal studies suggest that paclitaxel may have a unique ability to activate tumor cell apoptosis in the absence of wild-type p53 function. The authors previously demonstrated that response to paclitaxel and concurrent radiation was not affected by p53 mutations in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We sought to determine whether p53 mutations affect response to paclitaxel alone in patients with metastatic NSCLC. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with metastatic NSCLC who participated in Brown University Oncology Group protocols utilizing single-agent weekly paclitaxel had tumor tissue that was adequate for p53 analysis. Tumor tissue was evaluated for p53 gene mutations in exons 5 through 8 by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing of altered mobility polymerase chain reaction products. RESULTS: Mutations in p53 were found in 8 of 25 patients (32%). The response rates of 75% for patients with tumors with p53 mutations and 47% for patients with wild-type p53 do not differ significantly (P = 0.12). The 1-year survival rates for patients with and without p53 mutation after treatment with weekly paclitaxel were 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 31-100%) and 53% (95% CI, 33-86%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutations do not adversely affect response to paclitaxel as a single agent in metastatic NSCLC. These results provide clinical support for in vitro observations that paclitaxel can bypass mutant p53 and lead to tumor cell death by alternate pathway(s). Paclitaxel should be considered as a component of treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC with tumors that have p53 mutations",

    "Title": "The frequency of p53, K-ras mutations, and microsatellite instability differs in uterine endometrioid and serous carcinoma: evidence of distinct molecular genetic pathways",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The two most common types of uterine endometrial carcinoma, endometrioid (UEC) and serous (USC), differ in their histopathologic appearance and biologic behavior. Recent studies suggest that these differences may be associated with distinct molecular genetic alterations. METHODS: In the current study, the authors compared the frequencies of K-ras and p53 mutations and microsatellite instability (MI) between UEC and USC by analyzing all 3 molecular genetic changes in one set of tumors. Furthermore, the distribution of these molecular genetic alterations was determined among UECs of different histopathologic grade. The authors analyzed 58 UECs with known MI status for K-ras and p53 mutations. The K-ras and p53 genes were analyzed in 45 and 6 cases of USC, respectively. These results were combined with previous data on p53 mutations (21 cases) and MI (34 cases) in USC. RESULTS: MI was present in 16 of 57 UECs (28%) but in none of 34 USCs. p53 mutations were found in 7 of 42 UECs (17%) and 25 of 27 USCs (93%) by direct sequencing of exons 5-8. UECs and USCs with p53 mutations showed strong immunoreactivity for p53 in about 85% of the cases, whereas about 15% of the cases were immunonegative. K-ras mutations at codon 12 were found in 15 of 58 UECs (26%) and in only 1 of 45 USC (2%) by dot blot oligohybridization after polymerase chain reaction amplification of exon 1. Notably, the frequency of both K-ras and p53 mutations and MI was significantly different between UEC and USC (P < 0.001). In UECs, MI and K-ras mutations occurred in low grade as well as in high grade tumors, whereas p53 mutations were present almost exclusively in high grade tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that different molecular genetic pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of UEC and USC and that low grade UEC may progress to high grade UEC. These findings support the hypothesis that UEC and USC are separate entities and suggest that different molecular genetic alterations may be responsible for their distinct morphology and biologic behavior",

    "Title": "Characterization of a newly established human pancreatic carcinoma cell line, UK Pan-1",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: A highly tumorigenic cell line designated as UK Pan-1 was established in a surgically removed human pancreatic adenocarcinoma and characterized as having many of the genotypic and phenotypic alterations commonly found in pancreatic tumors. METHODS: The cell line was characterized by its morphology, growth rate in monolayer culture and soft agar, tumorigenicity in nude mice, and chromosomal analysis. Furthermore, the status of p53, Ki-ras mutation and transforming growth factor (TGF)-/receptor expression were determined. The characteristics of UK Pan-1 were compared with those of other commonly used pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. RESULTS: Quiescent UK Pan-1 cells could be stimulated to proliferate in growth factor free nutrient media, indicating a growth factor independent phenotype. UK Pan- 1 cells grew in soft agar and rapidly formed tumors in nude mice. This cell line possesses a mutation at codon 12 of the c-Ki-ras-2 gene that is commonly found in pancreatic carcinoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that two alleles of p53 tumor suppressor gene were present in UK Pan-1. However, sequencing analysis revealed a mutation in one allele at exon 8, codon 273 (G to A; Arg to His). Additional growth assays indicated that the cell line was insensitive to negative growth regulation induced by exogenous TGF-beta. Molecular analysis of the TGF-beta signaling pathway showed that UK Pan-1 did not express appreciable levels of the TGF-beta receptor type I, II, or III mRNAs, but did express DPC4 mRNA. Karyotype analysis revealed an 18q21 deletion indicating a possible loss of heterozygosity for DPC4, as well as other chromosomal deletions and rearrangements. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that UK Pan-1 is a highly tumorigenic cell line possessing a molecularly complex pattern of mutations that may be used as a model to further the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the development of pancreatic carcinoma",

    "Title": "Establishment and characterization of seven human renal cell carcinoma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines, and to investigate the cell phenotypes and molecular characteristics of human RCC cell lines and their corresponding tumour tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven human RCC cell lines from pathologically proven RCCs were established. The histopathology of the primary tumours, in vitro growth characteristics and status of tumour suppressor genes, mismatch repair genes and microsatellite instability (MSI) were examined in cell lines and their corresponding tumour tissues. Five of the cell lines were derived from clear cells (SNU-228, -267, -328, -349, and -1272), one from granular cells (SNU-482), and one from mixed clear and granular cell types (SNU-333). The mutational status was compared for von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), p53, TGF-beta type II receptor (TGF-betaRII), hMSH2, and hMLH1 genes in the cell lines and their corresponding tumour tissues. The MSI status of the cell lines was determined by screening for adenine repeat sequences, e.g. BAT-25, BAT-26, and BAT-40. RESULTS: All lines showed different doubling times and were confirmed by DNA fingerprinting analysis to be unique. Contamination by mycoplasma or bacteria was excluded. In two cell lines (SNU-349 and -1272) and their tumour tissues, mutations in the VHL gene were found. The SNU-267 line had a frameshift mutation in the p53 gene. A missense mutation of the TGF-betaRII gene was detected in the SNU-1272 line and the corresponding tissue. Analysis of the repeat sequences showed one cell line (SNU-349) to have MSI and the other six to have microsatellite stability. As MSI is a hallmark of the inactivation of mismatch repair genes, the presence of hMSH2 and hMLH1 mutations was investigated in all seven cell lines. An inactivating homozygous single base-pair deletion of the hMLH1 gene was found only in the SNU-349 cell line and corresponding tissue. Moreover, a frameshift mutation within an 8-bp polyadenine repeat present in the hMSH3 coding region was found only in the MSI cell line and tumour tissue. CONCLUSION: These newly established RCC cell lines should provide a useful in vitro model for studies related to human RCC. The SNU-349 cell line should be especially useful for studies of MSI and mismatch repair-defective RCCs",

    "Title": "Clinical significance of p53 mutations in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and cardia",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the frequency and spectrum of p53 gene mutations in adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and cardia and to compare clinical and pathologic features in patients with p53 mutant and nonmutant cancers. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The p53 gene is commonly mutated in human cancers, and a p53 mutation is reported to be present in more than 50% of esophageal adenocarcinomas. Although many studies have investigated the frequency of p53 protein overexpression in adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction, few studies have assessed the frequency and clinical significance of p53 mutations in these tumors. In particular, the prognostic importance of p53 mutation is uncertain. Adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and cardia share many epidemiologic and pathologic features, but it is controversial whether they represent the same tumor. A comparison of the frequency and spectrum of mutations in adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and cardia would test whether these tumors are also similar at the molecular level. METHODS: DNA was isolated from microdissected paraffin-embedded tumor tissues of patients who underwent esophagogastrectomy for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (n = 19), cardia (esophagogastric junction, n = 12), or subcardia (n = 6). Exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were analyzed for the presence of mutations using the polymerase chain reaction with single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing of bands showing abnormal mobility. The presence of mutation was confirmed by selective hybridization of a mutant-specific oligonucleotide to DNA isolated from the tumor. RESULTS: p53 mutations were identified in 18 of 37 (48.6%) tumors. Patients with p53 mutant tumors were significantly younger and had a significantly poorer prognosis. There was a similar prevalence of p53 mutations in adenocarcinomas of the esophagus (53%) and cardia (58%). In contrast, mutations were relatively uncommon in subcardia adenocarcinomas (one mutant tumor [17%]). The types of mutations found in the esophageal and the cardia cancers were also similar. CONCLUSIONS: Adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and cardia have a similar frequency and spectrum of p53 gene mutations, suggesting that these tumors have a common pathogenesis. Patients with mutations are younger, have signs of more advanced disease, and have a poorer prognosis than patients without mutations",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in epithelial ovarian cancers: possible role in predicting chemoresistance",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The investigators undertook a retrospective study to determine (1) whether p53 mutations are predictors of survival in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, (2) whether p53 status by sequencing is associated with established prognostic indicators, and (3) the agreement of results between direct sequencing of p53 mutations and immunohistochemistry. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was retrospective review of 43 patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer treated with surgery and by paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. Clinical data were extracted from the charts. By use of paraffin- embedded blocks, p53 analysis was carried out by (1) direct sequencing and (2) immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for overall and disease-free survivals. To determine whether p53 mutation (sequencing) was related to prognosis and to determine the agreement between p53 abnormalities by sequencing and immunohistochemistry, risk ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 57.4 years. Surgical stages were as follows: 5% were stage IIC, 79% were stage III, and 16% were stage IV. Seventy-seven percent of tumors were serous, and 56% of tumors were grade 3. All patients received paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. Mean disease-free and overall survivals were 16.4 and 22.6 months, respectively. p53 abnormalities were detected by sequencing in 53% of cases and by immunohistochemistry in 70%. Agreement between both techniques was 68%. Patients with stages IIC/IV had a risk of 1.7 of having a p53 mutation by sequencing; grade, histology, disease-free survival and overall survival were not predictive of p53 mutation status. DISCUSSION: The 54% mutation rate may be underestimated by limiting our analysis to exons 5 to 9. p53 mutation status was not predictive of survival (disease free and overall) or of chemoresistance; this suggests that paclitaxel-based apoptosis is independent of the p53 gene. The concomitant use of cisplatin, an inducer of apoptosis that is dependent on the normal function of p53, makes the interpretation of these results difficult. Histopathologic factors were not statistically associated with p53 status, but more advanced surgical stage and tumor grade were suggestive of higher rates of p53 mutations, implying more aggressive behavior. Finally, the lack of agreement between results obtained by sequencing and immunohistochemistry highlights the limitation of the latter technique and the possibility of underestimating abnormal p53 function. In conclusion, because discrepancies exist between the two techniques, we recommend direct sequencing of exons 4 through 10 to determine the true prevalence of p53 mutation. Furthermore, larger randomized studies are required to elucidate the role of p53 in predicting chemoresponse in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer",

    "Title": "Genetic aberration in primary hepatocellular carcinoma: correlation between p53 gene mutation and loss-of-heterozygosity on chromosome 16q21-q23 and 9p21-p23",
    "Abstract": "To elucidate the molecular pathology underlying the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we used 41 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers to examine 55 HCC and corresponding non-tumor liver tissues on chromosome 9, 16 and 17. Loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) is observed with high frequency on chromosomal region 17p13 (36/55, 65%), 9p21-p23 (28/55, 51%), 16q21-q23 (27/55, 49%) in tumors. Meanwhile, microsatellite instability is rarely found in these microsatellite loci. Direct sequencing was performed to detect the tentative mutation of tumor suppressor genes in these regions: p53, MTS1/p16, and CDH1/E-cadherin. Within exon 5-9 of p53 gene, 14 out of 55 HCC specimens (24%) have somatic mutations, and nucleotide deletion of this gene is reported in HCC for the first time. Mutation in MTS1/p16 is found only in one tumor case. We do not find mutations in CDH1/E-cadherin. Furthermore, a statistically significant correlation is present between p53 gene mutation and loss of chromosome region 16q21-q23 and 9p21-p23, which indicates that synergism between p53 inactivation and deletion of 16q21-q23 and 9p21-p23 may play a role in the pathogenesis of HCC",

    "Title": "Genetic analysis of Tp53 from urine sediment as a tool for diagnosing recurrence and residual of bladder carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Longitudinal study of Tp53 mutation in urine sediments of 26 patients with mutated primary transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder at different time periods after transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB), i.e. before and after the first TURB, prior to the control resection and before treatment of a recurrence. METHODS: DNA of the critical Tp53 exons 5-8 was anaylzed by temperature gradients (TGGE) and sequence. RESULTS: (1) In 11 of 12 patients (91.7%) mutation reoccurred with the detection of recurrence of the disease. The mutation frequency in patients without any recurrence was 1 in 8 (12.5%) after a follow-up period of 4-16 months. (2) In 7 of 10 patients, the mutation was no longer detectable in the urine sediment after TURB. (3) The mutation frequency at the control resection 6 weeks after the first TURB was 5 in 7 (71.4%) in patients found to have residual and 1 in 7 (14.2%) in the tumor-free patients. (4) In 9 of 10 samples identical mutations were found by sequence in the recurrent tumor. These results show a significant correlation between the detection of a Tp53 mutation in the urine sediments and tumor recurrence or residual. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Tp53 mutations in the urine sediment could be a useful indicator of tumor recurrence or tumor residual in patients ( approximately 40%) with primary mutated bladder cancer tissue. (2) These results support the monoclonal seeding theory. (3) The finding of identical mutations at different times indicate that the tumor was never totally removed",

    "Title": "Staining patterns of p53 immunohistochemistry and their biological significance in colorectal cancer",
    "Abstract": "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a cheap and rapid method to detect p53 inactivation but the results are often discordant with gene mutation analysis. This study aimed to investigate whether there is a difference in the immunohistochemical staining patterns of p53-positive cells on comparing tumours with inactivating gene mutations with those without. Tissues of 142 colorectal cancers were investigated for p53 inactivation simultaneously by IHC and gene analysis using SSCP of exons 4-9 and sequencing. In addition, tumours were investigated immunohistochemically for the expression of mdm-2 protein, known to be transcriptionally transactivated by the wild-type (wt) p53 gene. p53- positive cells of tumours without detectable p53 gene mutations were microdissected using a PALM laser microscope system and subjected to p53 sequence analysis. Among the 142 cases of colorectal cancer (male/female=88/54; mean age 66a+/-11 years, range 24-90 years), 74% (n=105) of tumours were positive by p53 IHC and mutations in the p53 gene were found in 51% (73 patients). In 16% (12 patients) with mutations in the p53 gene, IHC for p53 was negative. In tumours with mutations in the p53 gene and positive p53 IHC, staining of all nuclei of the tumour was more frequently (57/61, 93%) found than in tumours without p53 gene mutations, where staining of scattered single cells was predominantly seen (29/44, 66%; p<0.0001). mdm-2 positivity (n=33) showed only staining of scattered single cells, predominantly (24/33, 82%; p<0.0001) in tumours without gene mutations. Single cell microdissection followed by mutation analysis of scattered p53-positive cells revealed no gene mutations. A scattered positive immunohistochemical reactivity of p53 in colorectal cancer cells might therefore represent a functionally active non-mutated p53 gene and should not be considered as a marker of gene mutation and inactivation.

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations in sequential oral epithelial dysplasias and squamous cell carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Previous studies of oral cancer have suggested that alterations of the p53 tumour suppressor gene occur early in the precancerous stage of development. However, these observations have been based on cross- sectional assessment of abnormal p53 protein staining by immunohistochemistry and may not necessarily reflect gene changes. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to examine the changes in the p53 gene in progressive, sequential epithelial dysplasias and carcinomas from the oral cavity. The study analysed 24 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue biopsies from ten patients with two or more temporally distinct lesions from the same site in the oral cavity with the diagnosis of hyperkeratosis, epithelial dysplasia, carcinoma in situ or squamous cell carcinoma. Exons 5-8 of the p53 gene were amplified from genomic DNA using intronic primers and directly sequenced using fluorescent-labelled primers. Standard immunohistochemistry with the DO7 monoclonal antibody was used to detect mutant and wild-type p53 protein. Mutations of the p53 gene were identified in 9 of 24 samples. Eight were missense mutations and one occurred at a splice site. In six patients, mutations of the p53 gene occurred late after the transformation of epithelial dysplasia to carcinoma. In two patients with progressive dysplasia, but who had yet to develop invasive carcinoma, p53 missense mutations occurred at the carcinoma in situ stage in one case and in a moderate dysplasia in the other. There was an inconsistent relationship between gene mutations and the level of p53 protein staining by immunohistochemistry. It is concluded that during oral carcinogenesis, p53 gene mutations seem to occur relatively late and are associated with transformation to the invasive phenotype.

    "Title": "Significantly different bcl-2 expression profiles in gastric and non- gastric primary extranodal high-grade B-cell lymphomas",
    "Abstract": "Fifty-five cases of primary extranodal high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were investigated for bcl-2 and p53 protein expression as well as for t(14;18) translocations and p53 mutations. Phenotypic and genotypic profiles were compared between tumours of gastric (27 cases) and non-gastric (28 cases) origin. bcl-2 protein expression was significantly lower in gastric (11/27) than in non-gastric (28/28) lymphomas (p<0.0001), while nuclear p53 protein expression did not differ significantly between these two groups. In the stomach, there were no significant differences in either bcl-2 or p53 expression profiles between high-grade lymphomas with (n=14) and without (n=13) evidence of a low-grade component of MALT type. However, secondary high- grade lymphomas showed a significant down-regulation of bcl-2 protein (p<0.0001) and, conversely, an up-regulation of p53 protein (p<0.0001) as compared with their low-grade tumour components. In extranodal high- grade B-cell lymphomas, bcl-2 protein expression was not associated with t(14;18) translocation. Only one gastric lymphoma had a p53 point mutation with potential alteration of the amino acid sequence. These findings indicate that primary gastric high-grade B-cell lymphomas are immunohistologically distinct from primary extranodal high-grade B-cell lymphomas of an origin other than in the stomach",

    "Title": "Cellular phenotypes of differentiated-type adenocarcinomas and precancerous lesions of the stomach are dependent on the genetic pathways",
    "Abstract": "To elucidate the relationship between genetic alterations and cellular phenotypes in differentiated-type carcinomas and precancerous lesions of the stomach, mutations of p53, APC and K-ras genes were examined, as well as microsatellite instability (MSI), in 52 tumours of the stomach. Tumours were selected with the following phenotypical features, using mucin histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses, in addition to their morphological features: (1) tumours with an extremely well- preserved gastric foveolar phenotype (foveolar-type); (2) tumours with an extremely well-preserved complete-type intestinal metaplastic phenotype (CIM-type); and (3) ordinary tumours without extreme phenotypes (ordinary-type). MSI occurred in 45% of foveolar-type, 24% of ordinary-type, and 0% of CIM-type tumours. p53 gene alterations occurred in 5% of foveolar-type, 18% of ordinary-type, and 31% of CIM- type. APC gene alterations were detected in 9% of foveolar-type, 6% of ordinary-type, and 0% of CIM-type. No K-ras gene mutation was detected in any of the three types. These results indicate that the genetic pathways are quite different among the phenotypes of tumours of the stomach. The 'mutator pathway', characterized by MSI, plays an important role in the tumourigenesis of foveolar-type, but not CIM-type tumours. The 'suppressor pathway', represented by p53 alteration, could participate in the tumourigenesis of the CIM-type, but is rare in foveolar-type tumours",

    "Abstract": "In vitro studies have shown that immunoprecipitation with conformation-specific antibodies allows discrimination between different forms of p53; however, the significance of this has not been determined for human tumours. This study therefore examined p53 conformation in colorectal tumours and correlated this with mutational status and evidence of in vivo p53 downstream activity. Moreover, it was shown that for in vitro cell lines, DNA-damaging agents induce wild-type p53 to form a mutant conformation (PAb240+), with a concomitant rise in p21(WAF-1) expression. Induction of p53-mediated apoptosis, on the other hand, is associated with a wild-type conformation (PAb1620+). These results were confirmed for wild-type p53 in colorectal tumours. A range of p53 point mutations were found in exons 5-8 in colorectal tumours. Mutants with a wild-type conformation gave weak immunohistochemical staining, whereas mutations with flexible conformation (240+/1620+) gave intense positivity. Interestingly, this latter group of flexible mutants was also associated with features of poor prognosis. These studies show that not all p53 mutants are equal; thus, knowledge of the p53 status of a tumour may be required for a more precise prediction of prognosis and response to treatment for cancer patients",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in hairy cell leukemia",
    "Abstract": "We have studied the frequency of p53 mutations in genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood or the spleen of 61 patients with hairy cell leukemia using PCR-SSCP and automated cycle sequencing. We identified exon 5-8 mutations in 17 cases, corresponding to a frequency of 28%. In four cases, mutations were localized in exon 5; one patient with atypical HCL had a mutation in exon 6 at the 3' boundary; five cases showed mutations in exon 7, while exon 8 was found to be mutated in seven cases. The mutations found could be divided into three major categories: structural (n=9), inactivating (n= 6), and neutral (n= 2) mutations. None of the three transitions found occurred at CpG dinucleotides. The rate of p53 mutations found in this large cohort of HCL patients is unexpectedly high as in other non-Hodgkin lymphomas p53 mutations predict for poor treatment outcome. The character of the mutations we have found is entirely different from that described in other hematologic malignancies",

    "Title": "A novel natural killer cell line (KHYG-1) from a patient with aggressive natural killer cell leukemia carrying a p53 point mutation",
    "Abstract": "We present the establishment of a natural killer (NK) leukemia cell line, designated KHYG-1, from the blood of a patient with aggressive NK leukemia, which both possessed the same p53 point mutation. The immunophenotype of the primary leukemia cells was CD2+, surface CD3-, cytoplasmic CD3epsilon+, CD7+, CD8alphaalpha+, CD16+, CD56+, CD57+ and HLA-DR+. A new cell line (KHYG-1) was established by culturing peripheral leukemia cells with 100 units of recombinant interleukin (IL)-2. The KHYG-1 cells showed LGL morphology with a large nucleus, coarse chromatin, conspicuous nucleoli, and abundant basophilic cytoplasm with many azurophilic granules. The immunophenotype of KHYG-1 cells was CD1-, CD2+, surface CD3-, cytoplasmic CD3epsilon+, CD7+, CD8alphaalpha+, CD16-, CD25-, CD33+, CD34-, CD56+, CD57-, CD122+, CD132+, and TdT-. Southern blot analysis of these cells revealed a normal germline configuration for the beta, delta, and gamma chains of the T cell receptor and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes. Moreover, the KHYG-1 cells displayed NK cell activity and IL-2-dependent proliferation in vitro, suggesting that they are of NK cell origin. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA was not detected in KHYG-1 cells by Southern blot analysis with a terminal repeat probe from an EBV genome. A point mutation in exon 7 of the p53 gene was detected in the KHYG-1 cells by PCR/SSCP analysis, and direct sequencing revealed the conversion of C to T at nucleotide 877 in codon 248. The primary leukemia cells also carried the same point mutation. Although the precise role of the p53 point mutation in leukemogenesis remains to be clarified, the establishment of an NK leukemia cell line with a p53 point mutation could be valuable in the study of leukemogenesis",

    "Title": "UV mutation signature in tumor suppressor genes involved in skin carcinogenesis in xeroderma pigmentosum patients",
    "Abstract": "Molecular analysis of p53 and patched (PTCH), two candidate tumor suppressor genes for non-melanocytic skin cancer, was performed in skin tumors from six patients affected by the cancer-prone disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). UV-specific p53 mutations were detected at a frequency of 38-50% in all the tumor types analysed, including melanomas. Additional analysis of PTCH mutations in the subset of eight basal call carcinomas (BCC) revealed a very high mutation frequency of this gene (90%) which exceeded that detected in the p53 gene in the same tumors (38%). PTCH mutations were predominantly UV-specific C>T transitions. This mutation pattern is different from that reported in BCC from normal donors where PTCH mutation frequency is 27% and mutations are frequently deletions and insertions. These findings suggest that PTCH mutations represent an earlier event in BCC development than p53 alterations and that the inability of XP patients to repair UV-induced PTCH mutations might significantly contribute to the early and frequent appearance of BCC observed in these patients",

    "Title": "A serine 37 mutation associated with two missense mutations at highly conserved regions of p53 affect pro-apoptotic genes expression in a T-lymphoblastoid drug resistant cell line",
    "Abstract": "The p53 protein accumulates rapidly through post-transcriptional mechanisms following cellular exposure to DNA damaging agents and is also activated as a transcription factor leading to growth arrest or apoptosis.  Phosphorylation of p53 occurs after DNA damage thereby modulating its activity and impeding the interaction of p53 with its negative regulator oncogene Mdm2. The serines 15 and 37 present in the amino terminal region of p53 are phosphorylated by the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) in response to DNA damage.  In order to verify if specific p53 mutations occur in the multi-drug resistance phenotype, we analysed the p53 gene in two T-lymphoblastoid cell lines, CCRF-CEM and its multi-drug-resistant clone CCRF-CEM VLB100, selected for resistance to vinblastine sulfate and cross-resistant to other cytotoxic drugs.  Both cell lines showed two heterozygous mutations in the DNA binding domain at codons 175 and 248.  The multi-drug resistant cell line, CCRF-CEM VLB100, showed an additional mutation that involves the serine 37 whose phosphorylation is important to modulate the protein activity in response to DNA damage.  The effects of these mutations on p53 transactivation capacity were evaluated.  The activity of p53 on pro-apoptotic genes expression in response to DNA damage induced by (-irradiation, was affected in the vinblastine (VLB) resistant cell line but not in CCRF-CEM sensitive cell line resulting in a much reduced apoptotic cell death of the multi-drug resistant cells.",

    "Title": "Chromosomal instability and p53 inactivation are required for genesis of glioblastoma but not for colorectal cancer in patients with germline mismatch repair gene mutation",
    "Abstract": "We have previously reported high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and germ-line mismatch repair gene mutation in patients with unusually young onset of high-grade glioma. Some of these patients developed metachronous MSI-H colorectal cancer and conformed to the diagnosis of Turcot's syndrome. Frameshift mutation of TGFbetaRII was present in all the colorectal carcinomas but not in brain tumours. We further characterized the genetic pathways of tumour evolution in these metachronous gliomas and colorectal carcinomas. All MSI-H glioblastomas had inactivation of both alleles of the p53 gene and showed over- expression of the p53 protein while none of the colorectal carcinomas had p53 mutation or protein over-expression. Flow cytometry and comparative genomic hybridization revealed that all glioblastomas were chromosomal unstable with aneuploid DNA content, and with a variable number of chromosomal arm aberrations. In contrast, the colorectal carcinomas had diploid or near-diploid DNA content with few chromosomal arm aberrations. The pattern of chromosomal aberrations in the two organs was different. Loss of 9p was consistently observed in all glioblastomas but not in colorectal carcinomas. Epidermal growth factor receptor amplification was absent in all glioblastomas and colorectal carcinomas. Our results suggest that both the frequency of p53 mutation and its effects differ greatly in the two organs. Following loss of mismatch repair function, p53 inactivation and chromosomal instability are not necessary for development of colorectal carcinoma, but are required for genesis of glioblastoma.

    "Title": "p53 gene mutation and ink4a-arf deletion appear to be two mutually exclusive events in human glioblastoma",
    "Abstract": "P16 and P14ARF are two tumor suppressors encoded by the locus ink4a-arf which is frequently deleted in human tumors. Recent experiments performed with mouse embryonic fibroblasts have shown that P14ARF is an upstream regulator of the P53 pathway. This raises the question as to whether in human tumors the loss of p14arf and mutation of p53 are mutually exclusive events which segregate with genetic alterations at other loci. To examine this question we performed a multigenic analysis on 29 gliomas. We analysed p53 and p14arf in relation with five other genetic loci encoding the most frequently mutated genes in human gliomas: cdkn2a, mdm2, egfr, pten and the chromosomal regions 10q23.3 and 10q25-26. Our study shows for the first time that p53 mutations and p14arf deletions appear mutually exclusive in human glioblastoma, suggesting that they may be functionally redundant in glioma tumorigenesis. The P53 pathway is, therefore, disrupted in 81.8% of malignant gliomas (WHO grades III and IV), either by mutation of the p53 gene (31.8%) or by p14arf deletion (54.5%). These tumors further showed MDM2 overexpression (9.1%), egfr oncogene amplification/egfr overexpression (50%), pten mutations (27.3%) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the chromosomal regions 10q23.3 (86.4%) and 10q25-26 (100%). These alterations did not segregate with p53 mutations or p14arf deletions, while p14arf and cdkn2a were always deleted",

    "Title": "Alteration of a p53 gene status affects outcome of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer",
    "Abstract": "The aim of this longitudinal study was to examine whether and how the p53 gene is altered in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer and to determine the significance of p53 mutation in recurrent tumors. The primary and recurrent tumors were examined in 15 patients who had recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, and whose primary tumor contained a wild-type p53 gene. The interval between cytoreductive surgery and the appearance of recurrence ranged from 5. 2 to 63.6 months (mean 23.4 months). Mutations in the p53 gene were screened by polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and determined by cycle sequencing. Mutation of the p53 gene in the recurrent tumor was found in 7 of the 15 patients (46.7%). Estimated 3- and 5-year survival rates were 57.1 and 0%, respectively, for patients with p53 gene mutation detected in the recurrence tumor, and 75.0% and 37.5% for patients without the mutation (p = 0.0155). The interval between cytoreductive surgery and the appearance of recurrence did not differ between those groups (549.7 +/- 102.2 vs. 832.9 +/- 283.8 days). Mean survival time after recurrence was significantly better in the patients without mutation (438.6 +/- 56.4 vs. 873.0 +/- 157.5 days, p = 0.0125). The present study suggests that p53 gene mutation frequently occurs in recurrent ovarian cancer and that alteration of p53 gene status affects salvage chemotherapy. This phenomenon affects the prognosis of recurrent disease and may predict outcome. Copyright 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel",

    "Title": "Multiple primary tumors as an indicator for p16INK4a germline mutations in pancreatic cancer patients?",
    "Abstract": "Multiple primary tumors in pancreatic cancer patients might indicate a genetic predisposition to the development of malignancies. In this study we evaluated whether the mutation rate of the TP53 and p16INK4a genes of pancreatic cancers differs in pancreatic cancer patients with and without multiple primaries. Furthermore, we investigated whether pancreatic cancer patients with multiple primaries carry germline mutations in either p16INK4a, TP53, or BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes to detect a genetic alteration that predisposes to the development of different primaries. Fourteen (23%) of 60 pancreatic cancer patients developed histologically verified additional primaries during their lifetimes. Normal constitutional and tumor DNA of the 14 patients with a positive cancer history, but negative family history, were analyzed for p16INK4a, TP53, and BRCA2 mutations by single-strand conformational variant (SSCV) analysis and direct sequencing. Hypermethylation of the p16INK4a promoter region in pancreatic cancers was identified by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR; MSP). Four of 14 pancreatic carcinomas carried somatic intragenic p16INK4a mutations, and another four tumors revealed hypermethylation of the p16INK4a promoter region. Somatic intragenic TP53 mutations were identified in six of 14 tumors. None of the pancreatic cancer patients carried TP53 or BRCA2 germline mutations. In contrast, one of 14 pancreatic cancer patients with multiple primaries carried the p16INK4a mutation A68V in his germline. This mutation was localized in the conserved second ankyrin repeat of p16INK4a and did not occur in 100 control patients. The frequency of somatic TP53 and p16INK4a mutations in pancreatic cancer is similar in patients with and without multiple primaries. TP53 and BRCA2 germline mutations seem not to be significantly associated with the occurrence of multiple primaries in pancreatic cancer patients. However, p16INK4a germline mutations might be causative for tumor development in some pancreatic cancer patients with multiple primaries. The genetic investigation of patients with accumulation of different cancers even without a positive family history may be a new approach for the understanding of the relation of different cancers",

    "Title": "Primary node negative breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers has a poor outcome",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The association between BRCA1 germ-line mutations and breast cancer prognosis is controversial. A historical cohort study was designed to determine the prognosis for women with axillary lymph node negative hereditary breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We tested pathology blocks from 118 Ashkenazi Jewish women with axillary lymph node negative breast cancer for the presence of the two common BRCA1 founder mutations, 185delAG and 5382insC. Patients were followed up for a median of 76 months. Somatic TP53 mutations were screened for by immunohistochemistry, and direct sequencing was performed in the BRCA1- positive tumours. RESULTS: Sixteen breast cancer blocks (13.6%) carried a BRCA1 mutation. Young age of onset, high nuclear grade, negative estrogen receptor status and over-expression of p53 were highly associated with BRCA1-positive status (P-values all <0.01). BRCA1 mutation carriers had a higher mortality than non-carriers (five-year overall survival, 50% and 89.6%, respectively, P = 0.0001). Young age of onset, estrogen receptor negative status, nuclear grade 3, and over- expression of p53 also predicted a poor outcome. Cox multivariate analyses showed that only germ-line BRCA1 mutation status was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P = 0.01). Among nuclear grade 3 tumours, the BRCA1 mutation carrier status was a significant prognostic factor of death (risk ratio 5.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.5-22, P = 0.009). Sequencing of BRCA1-related breast cancers revealed one TP53 missense mutation not previously reported in breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Using a historical cohort approach, we have identified BRCA1 mutation status as an independent prognostic factor for node negative breast cancer among the Ashkenazi Jewish women. Those managing women carrying a BRCA1 mutation may need take these findings into consideration. Additionally, our preliminary results, taken together with the work of others suggest a different carcinogenic pathway in BRCA1-related breast cancer, compared to non-hereditary cases",

    "Title": "Identification of p53 gene mutations in breast cancers and their effects on transcriptional activation function",
    "Abstract": "Somatic mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most common genetic alterations found in human malignancies. In the present study, we studied 36 primary human breast carcinomas, using a polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and sequencing analysis of exons 2 through 9 for the presence of p53 gene mutations. Six of 36 (17%) breast cancers contained mutations within the core domain of the p53 protein responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding (codons 102-292); all 5 missense mutations clustered between codons 240 and 291 (codons 240, 243, 250, 285, and 291), whereas one nonsense mutation occurred at codon 199. By using recombinant PCR in vitro mutagenesis, we introduced point mutations at codons 199 from Gly to stop (gly199stop), 240 from Ser to Ile (ser240Ile), 250 from Pro to Ala (pro250ala), 285 from Glu to Lys (glu285lys), and 291 from Lys to Asn (lys291asn), and all the p53 sequences were subcloned into the CMVneoBam vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. To test whether the mutants p53 were functionally wild-type (wt) or mutant, we transfected them to p53- null Saos-2 cells with a reporter plasmid containing a p53-responsive element, and performed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay. Transient CAT assay for transcriptional activation revealed that one group, including gly199stop, ser240ile, glu285lys, and lys291asn, abolished the transcriptional activity, whereas the other group, including pro250ala, retained stronger transcriptional transactivation activity than that of wt p53",

    "Title": "A common polymorphism acts as an intragenic modifier of mutant p53 behaviour",
    "Abstract": "The p73 protein, a homologue of the tumour-suppressor protein p53, can activate p53-responsive promoters and induce apoptosis in p53-deficient cells. Here we report that some tumour-derived p53 mutants can bind to and inactivate p73. The binding of such mutants is influenced by whether TP53 (encoding p53) codon 72, by virtue of a common polymorphism in the human population, encodes Arg or Pro. The ability of mutant p53 to bind p73, neutralize p73-induced apoptosis and transform cells in cooperation with EJ-Ras was enhanced when codon 72 encoded Arg. We found that the Arg-containing allele was preferentially mutated and retained in squamous cell tumours arising in Arg/Pro germline heterozygotes. Thus, inactivation of p53 family members may contribute to the biological properties of a subset of p53 mutants, and a polymorphic residue within p53 affects mutant behaviour",

    "Title": "Prognostic significance of mutations in the p53 gene in superficial bladder cancer",
    "Abstract": "Bladder tumors as the most common urologic malignancy present mostly as superficial transitional cell carcinoma. Many patients with superficial bladder cancer have a good prognosis, however, may develop recurrences or progress to muscle invasive or metastatic disease. It is therefore important to find new markers associated with the biological behaviour of an individual tumor for identifying patients at risk for disease progression. Previous reports on the prognostic significance of p53 alterations in bladder tumors revealed conflicting results. The aim of our study was to evaluate p53 mutation analysis as an effective concept for the characterization of subsets of superficial bladder tumors differing in biological aggressiveness. Screening 66 amplified DNA from micro-dissected tumor cells by direct genomic sequencing p53 alterations were detected in 12%. We found no association between p53 status and tumor stage but a tendency to a higher mutation rate in more malignant tumors (G2 and G3) compared to G1 tumors and a higher recurrence rate in patients with a p53 mutation in the primary tumor after 24 months follow-up. We conclude a general low incidence of p53 mutations in superficial bladder cancer. Detectable p53 damage might be related to a more aggressive phenotype and a higher recurrence risk. Our results are discussed in the context of other studies reviewed from 1995-2000",

    "Title": "Radiation-induced cell cycle delays and p53 status of early passage melanoma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Cell cultures exposed to DNA-damaging agents such as gamma radiation respond by arresting at cell cycle checkpoints, and the p53 tumor suppressor protein is strongly implicated in this behavior. We have investigated the TP53 status and cell cycle response to ionizing radiation of a series of early passage cell lines (designated NZM1 to NZM15) previously developed from patients with metastatic melanoma. The TP53 status of each of the cell lines was determined by single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence analysis. The majority of the lines appeared to have a wild-type TP53 gene sequence, consistent with published studies. Two lines (NZM4 and NZM7.2) were found to have an identical T--&gt;C transition mutation in nucleotide 721 (exon 7) of the coding region. NZM7.2 (mutant) and NZM7.4 (wild-type) were clonally derived from the same line (NZM7). The existence of radiation-induced cell cycle arrest in G and/or G2M phase was determined 16 h after irradiation (6.3 Gy) by DNA staining and flow cytometric analysis. The mitotic inhibitor paclitaxel was used as a reference compound, with or without irradiation, to assess the efficiency of radiation-induced cell cycle arrest. G1 phase arrest was associated only with the presence of the wild-type TP53 gene, but the efficiency of induced arrest varied among the cell lines and the period of G phase arrest appeared to be short. A significant difference (P &lt; 0.002) was also found between the efficiency of induction of G2 phase arrest and the presence of wild-type TP53 gene. The results provide evidence that although the melanoma cell lines generally had an intact TP53 gene, the efficiency of p53-mediated cycle arrest might be deficient and contribute to the resistance of this tumor to treatment",

    "Title": "BRCA1-related papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum has a unique molecular pathogenesis",
    "Abstract": "Papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum (PSCP) is believed to develop de novo from the peritoneal lining of the pelvis and abdomen. Although it is histologically indistinguishable from serous ovarian carcinoma, PSCP exhibits minimal or absent ovarian involvement and may even develop in a woman years after prophylactic oophorectomy. We have shown previously that patients with germ-line BRCA1 mutations who develop PSCP are more likely to have disease originating from multiple peritoneal sites compared with patients with wild-type BRCA1. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that BRCA1-related PSCP has a unique molecular pathogenesis. DNA was extracted from normal tissue and multiple tumor sites in patients with PSCP. BRCA1 and p53 gene mutations were screened for using single-strand conformation polymorphism. Loss of heterozygosity was determined at the BRCA1 and p53 loci. Immunohistochemical analyses of p53, epidermal growth factor receptor, erbB-2, erbB-3, erbB-4, and Bcl-2 expression were performed. We detected germ-line BRCA1 mutations in 11 (26%) of 43 PSCP patients. BRCA1 mutation carriers had a higher overall incidence of p53 mutations (89% versus 47%; P = 0.052), were more likely to exhibit multifocal or null p53 mutations (63% versus 7%; P = 0.014), and were less likely to exhibit erbB-2 overexpression (P = 0.013) than wild-type BRCA1 case subjects. We propose that the unique molecular pathogenesis of BRCA1- related PSCP may affect the ability of current methods to reliably prevent or detect this disease prior to metastasis",

    "Title": "Detection of plasma tumor DNA in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma by microsatellite typing and p53 mutation analysis",
    "Abstract": "Recent arguments have suggested that tumor DNA in cancer patients could be found in plasma, but different points remain unclear. Using a series of 117 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors, our goals for this study were: (a) to quantify the amount of plasma DNA; (b) to evaluate the presence of plasma tumor DNA; and (c) to analyze the clinical relevance of tests based on plasma DNA analyses. Low levels of plasma DNA were found in most samples, but all were successfully amplified. Two different methods were used to detect tumor-specific genetic alterations: (a) microsatellite instability at UT5085 with an established sensitivity of 1:500; and (b) p53 mutation screening. Of the 117 tumors typed at UT5085, 65 demonstrated bandshifts (55%). Plasma and tumor DNA a showed similar alteration in only one case among these samples, and the prevalence of tumor DNA in plasma was estimated to be <2% using microsatellite analysis. Tumor DNA was detected in plasma at a higher prevalence (2 of 11 cases) when using p53 mutant allele-specific amplification. These results showed that in plasma, tumor DNA is largely diluted by normal DNA. By comparison with previously published studies, the prevalence of microsatellite alterations in plasma in this series of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas is very low, despite the fact that a large series of tumors was analyzed. To explain this discrepancy, we analyzed the possibility of PCR artifacts as suspected by the presence of loss of heterozygosity in two plasma DNA samples without a similar tumor DNA alteration. When DNA concentrations were under the threshold of detection (<100 ng/ml), we demonstrated that PCR artifacts could occur at random, and, if misinterpreted, these false genetic alterations could artificially enhance the frequency of plasma DNA alterations. This may have been suspected in previously published series, but it has never been discussed before. Microsatellite analysis on plasma DNA is difficult to interpret and can frequently be misleading. Plasma DNA should be analyzed with very sensitive and specific methods such as mutant allele- specific amplification, which excludes artifacts but requires specific optimization that is probably not compatible with routine and clinical use",

    "Title": "Deregulation of the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 pathway is a prerequisite for human astrocytic gliomas with G1-S transition control gene abnormalities",
    "Abstract": "Deregulation of G1-S transition control in cell cycle is one of the important mechanisms in the development of human tumors including astrocytic gliomas. We have previously reported that approximately two- thirds of glioblastomas (GBs) had abnormalities of G1-S transition control either by mutation/homozygous deletion of RB1 or CDKN2A p16INK4A), or amplification of CDK4 (K. Ichimura et al., Oncogene, 13: 1065-1072, 1996). However, abnormalities of G1-S transition control genes may induce p53-dependent apoptosis in cells. Recent investigations suggest that p14ARF is induced in response to abnormal cell cycle entry and results in p53 accumulation by inhibiting MDM2- mediated transactivational silencing and degradation of p53. To investigate the roles of the G1-S transition control system and the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 pathway in the development of astrocytic gliomas, we examined abnormalities of genes involved in these regulatory pathways in a total of 190 primary human astrocytic gliomas of different malignancy grades [136 GBs, 39 anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs) and 15 astrocytomas (As)]. Sixty-seven percent of GBs (91/136) and 21% of AAs (8/39) had abnormalities of the G1-S control system either by mutation/homozygous deletion of RB1, CDKN2A or CDKN2B, or amplification of CDK4. Seventy-six percent of GBs (103 of 136), 72% of AAs (28 of 39), and 67% of As (10 of 15) had deregulated p53 pathway either by mutation of TP53, amplification of MDM2, or homozygous deletion/mutation of p14ARF. When all of the data were combined and compared, 96% of GBs (87 of 91) and 88% of AAs (7 of 8) with abnormal G1-S transition control also had deregulated p53 pathway. Thus, we demonstrate that deregulation of the G1-S transition control system was almost always accompanied by inactivation of the p53 pathway, clearly illustrating the cooperative roles of these two systems in the development/progression of primary human astrocytic gliomas",

    "Title": "p53 Mutations and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in a multicenter study on lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "Biomarker data may provide a way to strengthen the link between environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and lung cancer shown in epidemiological studies. We conducted a multicenter case-control study to investigate the association between ETS exposure and lung cancer in never-smokers using p53 mutations as a biomarker of tobaccoo-related carcinogenesis. Paraffin-embedded tissue or fresh tissue samples from 91 never-smokers and 66 smokers with histologically confirmed lung cancer and interview data about smoking habits and ETS exposure were analyzed for mutations in the p53 gene.  Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate logistic regression.  Among the lifelong nonsmokers, the overall mutation prevalence was 10% (nine cases).  Among 48 never-smokers ever exposed to spousal ETS, 13% (six cases) showed mutations.  Smokers exhibited 17 (26 %) mutations.  A 3-fold [odds ratio, 2,9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-7.2] increased risk of p53 was observed for smokers as compared with all never-smokers combined (i.e., irrespective of ETS exposure).  The increase was 4.4-fold (95% CI, 1.2-16.2) when compared with never-smokers without ETS exposure.  Among never-smokers, the risk of mutation was doubled (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.5-8.7) for exposure to spousal ETS only, based on 6 exposed cases with mutation and 42 exposed cases without mutation.  The risk was 1.5 (95% CI, 0.2-8.8) for those ever exposed to spousal or workplace ETS as compared with those never exposed to spousal or workplace ETs.  For smokers, the most common mutation type was G:C to T:A transversion (31%), whereas G:C to A:T transitions were predominant among never smokers (57%).  In conclusion, our study indicates a significant 3-4 fold increased risk of p53 mutation in smoking lung cancer cases, and it suggests that mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis in ETS-exposed never-smokers include mutations in the p53 gene, similar to that seen in smokers.  However, the mutation patterns observed also suggest a difference between smokers and never-smokers.  clearly, additional investigations of the role of p53 mutation as a biomarker for tobacco-related carcinogenesis, including that related to ETS, are indicated.",

    "Title": "Somatic mutations of LKB1 and beta-catenin genes in gastrointestinal polyps from patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome",
    "Abstract": "Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is characterized by multiple gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps, mucocutaneous melanin deposition, and increased risk of cancer, mainly in the gastrointestinal tract. We examined mutations of the LKB1, beta- catenin, APC, K-ras, and p53 genes in 27 gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps from 10 patients in nine PJS families. Of these hamartomatous polyps, one intestinal polyp had an adenomatous lesion, and one gastric polyp contained adenomatous and carcinomatous lesions. Germ-line mutations of the LKB1 gene were detected in six PJS families. Somatic mutations of the LKB1 gene were found in 5 polyps, whereas loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the LKB1 locus at 19p was seen in 14 other polyps. In adenomatous lesions microdissected from hamartomatous polyps, both beta-catenin mutation and 19p LOH were detected. Furthermore, a carcinomatous lesion in a gastric hamartomatous polyp was found to contain a mutation of the p53 gene and LOH at the p53 locus in addition to LOH at the LKB1 locus and a beta-catenin mutation. K-ras mutations were detected in a few polyps, whereas no APC mutation or 5q LOH was detected in hamartomatous polyps. These results suggest that gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps in PJS patients develop through inactivation of the LKB1 gene by germ-line mutation plus somatic mutation or LOH of the unaffected LKB1 allele, and that additional mutations of the beta-catenin gene and p53 gene convert hamartomatous polyps into adenomatous and carcinomatous lesions",

    "Title": "Comparison of TP53 mutations identified by oligonucleotide microarray and conventional DNA sequence analysis",
    "Abstract": "As the rate of gene discovery accelerates, more efficient methods are needed to analyze genes in human tissues. To assess the efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity of different methods, alterations of TP53 were independently evaluated in 108 ovarian tumors by conventional DNA sequence analysis and oligonucleotide microarray (p53 GeneChip). All mutations identified by oligonucleotide microarray and all disagreements with conventional gel-based DNA sequence analysis were confirmed by re-analysis with manual and automated dideoxy DNA sequencing. A total of 77 ovarian cancers were identified as having TP53 mutations by one of the two approaches, 71 by microarray and 63 by gel-based DNA sequence analysis. The same mutation was identified in 57 ovarian cancers, and the same wild type TP53 sequence was observed in 31 ovarian cancers by both methods, for a concordance rate of 81%. Among the mutation analyses discordant by these methods for TP53 sequence were 14 cases identified as mutated by microarray but not by conventional DNA sequence analysis and 6 cases identified as mutated by conventional DNA sequence analysis but not by microarray. Overall, the oligonucleotide microarray demonstrated a 94% accuracy rate, a 92% sensitivity, and an 100% specificity. Conventional DNA sequence analysis demonstrated an 87% accuracy rate, 82% sensitivity, and a 100% specificity. Patients with TP53 mutations had significantly shorter overall survival than those with no mutation (P = 0.02). Women with mutations in loop2, loop3, or the loop-sheet-helix domain had shorter survival than women with other mutations or women with no mutations (P = 0.01). Although further refinement would be helpful to improve the detection of certain types of TPS3 alterations, oligonucleotide microarrays were shown to be a powerful and effective tool for TP53 mutation detection",

    "Title": "Alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking increase the frequency of p53 mutations in non-small cell lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a strong association between tobacco use and lung cancer; however, the genetic targets of these carcinogens and the role of other environmental agents in this process have yet to be defined. We examined the contribution of alcohol use and cigarette smoking top53 gene mutations in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Mutations of the p53 gene were detected by sequence analysis in 105 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Patient characteristics significantly associated with p53 gene mutations were determined using logistic regression. Mutations in the p53 gene were present in 53% of the patients (56 of 105). p53 mutations were more common in patients who used alcohol than in patients who consumed less than one drink per day (72 versus 39%; P = 0.003), and were detected more often smokers than nonsmokers (58% versus 10%, P = 0.02). Mutations in the p53 gene were present more often (P = 0.01) in alcohol drinkers who smoked cigarettes [76% (31 of 41)], than in nondrinkers (<1 drink per day) who smoked cigarettes [42% (20 of 48)] or in nondrinkers who did not smoke [14% (1 of 7)]. In conclusion, alcohol consumption and tobacco use are both associated with p53 mutations in non-small cell lung cancer. The link between exposure to both alcohol and tobacco and p53 mutations raises the possibility that alcohol may enhance the mutagenic effects of cigarette smoke in the lung",

    "Title": "Relating genotype and phenotype in breast cancer: an analysis of the prognostic significance of amplification at eight different genes or loci and of p53 mutations",
    "Abstract": "Breast cancer heterogeneity can be related directly to its variability at the genetic level. Thus, tumor genotyping could be a valuable approach to define breast tumor subtypes. It has been shown that it is possible to delineate subgroups of breast tumors according to specific sets of DNA amplifications. The aim of the present work was to study the prognostic significance of these DNA amplifications. We studied DNA amplification at eight genes or loci (AIB1, CCND1, EMS1, ERBB2, FGFR1, MDM2, MYC, and RMC20C001) as well as p53 mutations in a series of 640 breast cancer patients who had not received presurgical therapy and analyzed the correlations with survival DNA amplification was assessed by Southern blotting and was scored positive when exceeding three to five copies. Mutations in the p53 gene were searched by four-color fluorescent single. strand conformational polymorphism, using an automated sequencer. Of the nine genetic alterations tested, four (CCND1, EMS1, FGFR1, and p53 mutations) showed a significant association with reduced disease-free (DFS) and/or overall survival (OVS) in the unselected set of patients by univariate test. Correlations for p53 were found only when selecting mutations in exons 5 or 7. Analysis of node-negative and -positive subgroups of patients showed that MDM2 amplification and p53 mutations bore prognostic significance in node-negative patients, whereas amplification of CCND1, EMS1, and FGFR1 correlated with poor outcome in node-positive patients. Multivariate analysis on an unselected set of patients retained significance for the amplification of EMS1, FGFR1, and MDM2 with DFS, of CCND1 with OVS, and of RMC20C001 with both DFS and OVS. Interestingly, stratified analysis according to nodal status confirmed results obtained in the univariate tests: significance of MDM2 amplification and p53 mutations in node-negative and that of CCND1, EMS1, and FGFR1 in node-positive patients. We also observed an association between the number of genetic alterations observed in a tumor and poor prognosis. Patients with two or more amplified loci had a worsened outcome. Strongly correlating coamplifications such as CCND1 and FGFR1, as well as ERBB2 and MYC, were associated with a significant reduction of patient survival, thus indicating cooperative effects. Our data support the idea that genetic alterations in breast cancer are not only helpful for phenotyping purposes, but can also represent powerful prognostic indicators in the clinical practice",

The risk of developing multiple tumors in this compartment of the body is well established. We studied 6 distinct tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract of a single patient for loss of heterozygosity (LOH), microsatellite instability (MSI), p53 mutations, and K-ras codon 12 point mutations. We detected a unique pattern of LOH and p53 mutations in all 6 tumors.  No tumor showed a K-ras mutation or MSI. The results support the mechanism of 'field cancerization' and illustrate the potential power of molecular techniques to elucidate pathogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are reported in various kinds of malignancies including lymphomas. However, p53 gene mutations in nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma have not been reported because most parts of tumors are necrotic and a small amount of living tumor tissues is available for the molecular study. Expression and mutations of the p53 gene were examined in the paraffin-embedded specimens of the nasal lesions from 42 Chinese (Beijing and Chengdu) and Japanese (Okinawa and Osaka) patients with nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma by the immunohistochemistry and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified products followed by direct sequencing. Thirty single-nucleotide substitution mutations were observed in 20 of 42 cases (47.6%). Among the 30 mutations, 18 were missense (mainly G:C to A:T transitions), 9 were silent, and 1 was a nonsense mutation. The remaining 2 mutations involved intron 5 and exon 5 terminal points. Abnormal expression of the p53 protein was also observed in 19 of 42 (45.2%) cases. The incidence was significantly (4- fold) higher in the cases of Osaka than those in other areas, although the incidence of p53 mutations in the cases of Osaka was one-half to one-third of those in the other three areas. The results may suggest some racial, environmental, or lifestyle differences in the cause of nasal tumorigenesis",

    "Title": "Discordance of p53 mutations of synchronous colorectal carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "It is unclear whether synchronous multiple tumors arise from multicentric or monoclonal origins. To verify the multicentric origin of synchronous colorectal carcinomas at a genetic level, immunohistochemical and molecular techniques were used to determine the p53 alterations in individual lesions of synchronous colorectal carcinomas. This study was based on a total of 32 colorectal tumors from 16 patients. Twenty-one of the 32 (66%) advanced tumors examined had positive staining for p53. Single-strand conformation polymorphism and polymerase chain reaction direct sequencing were carried out for exons 5 to 8 of p53. All cases had p53 mutations in one or more tumors of synchronous lesions. In nine patients in this series, individual lesions were found to carry a different mutated codon of the p53 gene. In the other seven patients, a p53 mutation was found in one tumor but not in another. These results indicate discordance of the mutation pattern of p53 in individual lesions of multiple colorectal carcinomas and support the idea that most synchronous colorectal carcinomas are genetically distinguishable and are multicentric in origin. We also confirmed the high frequency of p53 mutations in left-sided (71%) and rectal (91%) carcinomas, rather than right-sided (43%; P = .04) carcinomas, suggesting that the molecular mechanism of synchronous colorectal carcinomas might differ between right- and left-sided tumors in the same patient",

    "Title": "Molecular abnormalities of p53, MDM2, and H-ras in synovial sarcoma",
    "Abstract": "Forty-nine cases of synovial sarcoma were evaluated for mutation of the p53 gene, amplification of the MDM2 gene and mutation of the H-ras gene, and for the relation of these factors to overall survival and clinicopathologic parameters. All investigations were carried out on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded materials. Furthermore, we evaluated the expression of p53 protein, MDM2, and p21(WAF1/CIP1) immunohistochemically in these cases, together with an assessment of proliferative activities using monoclonal antibody MIB-1. Nine of the 49 cases (18.4%) had p53 gene alteration detected by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing. Eleven cases (24%) showed nuclear accumulation of p53 protein in more than 10% of the tumor cells. Among them, only three cases contained gene mutations. There was no correlation between p53 nuclear accumulation and p53 gene alteration. MDM2 gene amplification, as shown by differential PCR, was observed in 19 out of 47 cases (40%). Nineteen out of 49 cases (38.8%) showed immunoreactivity for MDM2. MDM2 gene amplification and the expression of MDM2 protein showed a significant positive relationship (P = 0.0004). Moreover, MDM2 immunoreaction was significantly correlated with nuclear accumulation of p53 protein (P = 0.023). Positive immunoreaction for p21(WAF1/CIP1) was observed in 21 out of 48 cases (43.8%). p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression was correlated with p53 protein expression. H-ras gene mutations were seen in only three cases (6.1%). All mutations were in codon 12 (one GGC-to-AGC [Gly-to-Ser] mutation and two GGC-to-GAC [Gly-to-Ap] mutations). The gene alteration of p53, MDM2, and H-ras did not affect the patients' prognosis. Although the cases with positive immunoreaction for p53 tended to have a worse prognosis, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.13). No correlation was observed between MIB-1 LI and the immunohistochemical expression of p53, MDM2, and p21(WAF1/CIP1) or the mutation status of p53 and H-ras. On the other hand, high MIB-1 LI (more than 10) significantly correlated with poor prognosis (P < 0.0001). Our results suggest that p53 gene mutation does not appear to be a major prognostic factor and H- ras mutations are infrequent in synovial sarcoma",

    "Title": "Mdm2 gene amplification in gastric cancer correlation with expression of Mdm2 protein and p53 alterations",
    "Abstract": "Mdm2, localized on chromosome 12, is considered a negative regulator of p53 function and seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of a variety of tumors. The mdm2 amplification in advanced-stage gastric carcinoma has not yet been investigated. Mdm2 amplification was determined in 43 gastric carcinomas, and the genetic results were correlated with mdm2 protein expression, p53 alterations, and clinicopathologic data. The tumors were classified according to Lauren: 20 intestinal-type tumors, 19 tumors of diffuse growth inclusive of a primary small cell carcinoma, and 4 carcinomas with mixed differentiation. Staging was based on the pTNM classification system. Mdm2 and p53 were demonstrated by immunohistology on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. The mdm2 oncogene was amplified by nonradioactive hybridization of tumor DNA with an mdm2 cDNA probe. The Southern blots were evaluated densitometrically. For p53 mutation screening, we analyzed the highly conservative regions of the p53 gene (exons 4 to 8) with the use of the polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. Polymerase chain reaction products with band shifting were directly sequenced. Mdm2 amplification was demonstrated in 18 tumors (41.8%). The mdm2 gene was amplified more frequently in carcinomas with a diffuse growth pattern. Gastric carcinomas of the intestinal type, however, showed a higher frequency of p53 alterations. There was no statistical significance of the molecular genetic and immunohistologic results of the mdm2/p53 status to staging as well as to age and sex of the patients. The mdm2/p53 pathway is a part of the carcinogenesis of gastric carcinoma. Only approximately 20% of gastric carcinomas failed to show mdm2 and/or p53 alterations. The upregulation of the mdm2 oncogene and the accompanying inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene 53 seem to play a role above all in carcinomas of the diffuse type",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 gene are one of the most common genetic changes found in cancer; their presence may be prognostic and even influence treatment for breast cancer. In this study, we investigated whether DNA could be extracted from the residual cells left in ThinPrep-processed breast fine-needle aspirates and whether p53 gene changes could be detected in the DNA. The results were then correlated with DNA extracted from the matched formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, surgically resected breast cancer when available. DNA was successfully extracted from 54 of 62 aspirates and all 31 surgical specimens. p53 gene mutations were detected in 10 of the 54 cytology specimens (18.5%) and consisted of base pair substitutions or deletions. Silent or intronic p53 changes were found in five additional aspirates. One of the aspirates had two gene alterations, resulting in a total of six gene changes. Five of these changes were located in introns 6 or 9 and the sixth was a silent (no amino acid change) change in exon 6. p53 Polymorphisms were detected in nine aspirates (16.3%) and were located in codon 47 (one aspirate), codon 72 (six aspirates), and codon 213 (two aspirates). All cases with surgical material available showed identical p53 mutations, alterations, and polymorphisms in the resected tumors compared with those detected in the corresponding aspirates. The results of this study show that DNA suitable for analysis of p53 gene sequence changes can be successfully extracted from ThinPrep-processed breast fine-needle aspirates, and that identical alterations are detected in both the cytology and surgical specimens",

A significantly higher prevalence of p53 mutations was associated with the cardiac location (odds ratio, 7.09; confidence interval, 1.56 to 32.11). In all but one case, p53 mutations were associated with a stage higher than I. All eight mutations were located at CpG sites, where G : C to A : T transitions have been associated with frequent methylation at the C5 position of cytosine. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that, unlike what has been consistently demonstrated in the general population, p53 mutations are uncommon in gastric cancer occurring in young patients, and in such patients, p53 alterations are significantly associated with the cardiac location",

    "Title": "p53 and K-ras gene mutations in carcinoma of the rectum among Finnish women",
    "Abstract": "AIMS/BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify p53 and K-ras gene mutations in carcinoma of the rectum among Finnish women. Mutation patterns might give clues to aetiological factors when comparisons are made with other human tumours. METHODS: Of 134 women with carcinoma of the rectum, paraffin wax embedded specimens of the tumour tissue were obtained from 118 patients. Genomic DNA was extracted, and exons 4-8 of the p53 gene and codons 12/13 and 61 of the K-ras gene were amplified, and analysed for mutations by single strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. The production of p53 and K-ras proteins was studied by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The overall crude frequency for mutations in the p53 gene was 35% but the true frequency appears to be higher (up to 56%). In the K-ras gene, the mutation frequency (15%) was significantly lower than that reported for colon cancer. In the p53 gene, the mutation frequency increased significantly with patient age. In a high proportion of patients (14%) the rectal tumours contained small subclones of tumour cells that displayed extremely rare mutations at codons 110 and 232 of the p53 gene. Hot spot codon 175 mutations were significantly less common in rectal cancer than in cancer of the colon. CONCLUSIONS: Rectal cancer among Finnish women has characteristics in the mutations of the p53 and K-ras genes that are uncommon in other human tumours, including cancer of the colon. A biological explanation of these findings is not clear at present, but might be associated with an unidentified genetic factor in Finland",

    "Abstract": "This report details a rapid method for screening the entire p53 coding region (exons 2-11). This method, based on the non-isotopic RNase cleavage assay, uses novel primer sequences and an adaptation of the MutationScreener method. A mutation in 20% of the sample was easily detectable by this method, whereas mutations below 50% were undetectable using the original method. Alterations to the wild-type p53 mRNA sequence were found in nine of the 130 patients with low grade lymphoproliferative disorders screened, and this was confirmed by DNA sequencing in eight of eight samples. The method is a simple and reliable technique for screening for p53 mutations",

    "Title": "Mutation of p53 gene codon 63 in saliva as a molecular marker for oral squamous cell carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "The inactivation of tumor suppressor gene (TSG) is important during multistage carcinogenesis. The p53 TSG is frequently mutated in oral squamous cell carcinomas. These mutations can serve as very specific markers for the presence of tumor cells in a background of normal cells. In this study, 10 oral squamous cell carcinoma patients and 27 normal dental students were collected from Chung Shan Medical and Dental College Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. Extractions of DNA from saliva were obtained. Exon 4 and intron 6 within the p53 gene were amplified with polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) followed by DNA sequence analysis. DNA sequence analysis of PCR products revealed that five of eight (62.5%) tumor saliva samples and five of 27 (18. 52%) healthy saliva samples contained p53 exon 4 codon 63 mutations. These results were significantly different by using Chi-square test (P<0.05). The majority of the base substitutions were C deletions. Probable hot spots for the mutation were identified at exon 4 codon 63, which has not been observed before in head and neck cancers. Our study indicated that mutation of p53 codon 63 in saliva might be a molecular marker for oral squamous cell carcinomas. In addition, the amount of DNA recovered from saliva in most cases is sufficiently large and its quality suitable to enable PCR amplification which could be used in the search for mutations. The protocol described is rapid, cheap, and easy to perform, and may be useful for epidemiological studies for oral carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Correlation between morphological heterogeneity and genetic alteration within one tumor in adenocarcinomas of the lung",
    "Abstract": "In some human cancers, multistep carcinogenesis has been advocated on the basis of morphological and genetic analysis. In adenocarcinoma of the lung, a carcinogenetic process from atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) to bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma (BAC) and/or more malignant adenocarcinoma has been recently suggested. In the present study, we selected 13 lung tumors which had AAH-like or BAC-like areas at the periphery, and poorly differentiated areas at other sites, and examined their loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 3p, 9p and 17p and point mutation of the p53 gene. A heterogeneous pattern of LOH and/or point mutation of the p53 gene was detected in five of 13 cases, and genetic alterations were frequent in the areas of poorer differentiation. These findings suggest that some adenocarcinomas of the lung occur through multistep carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Correlation between genetic alterations and histopathological subtypes in bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia of the lung",
    "Abstract": "Bronchio-alveolar carcinoma (BAC) is a type of lung adenocarcinoma characterized by growth alongthe alveolar wall.  It is divided into two subtypes: sclerosing BAC (SBAC), which has central fibrosis, and non-sclerosing BAC (NSBAC), which lacks central fibrosis.  We compared the genetic alterations in these two types of BAC with those in atypical adnomatous hyperplasia (AAH). Tehre were 39 cases of SBAC, 19 of NSBAC and 20 of AAH.  To detect the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) we used the microsatellite markers D3S1234 and D3S1300 on chromosome 3p, IFNA and D9S144 on 9p, and TP53 on 17p.  We also used polymerase chain reaction-SSCP analysis and direct sequencing to examine a point mutation of the p53 gene at exons 5-8. At the TP53 locus, the frequencies of LOH showed a statistical rank-difference correlation among AAH, NSBAC and SBAC. On chromosomes 3p and 9p there were no statistical differences of LOH among AAH, NSBAC and SBAC. We detected a signficant statistical rank-difference correlation in the p53 mutation among AAH, NSBAC and SBAC. These findings suggest that a process of multistep carcinogenesis from AAH through NSBAC to SBAC might occur in some cases of adenocarcinoma, and LOH of 3p and 9p might be an early event of carcinogenesis, while the p53 mutation might be a later event.",

    "Title": "Transition from squamous cell carcinoma to adenocarcinoma in adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung",
    "Abstract": "The heterogeneity of tumor cells is frequently observed in lung cancer, but the clonality of these cells has not yet been established. The distinct components of 12 lung adenosquamous carcinomas were compared by genetic alterations of p53 and K-ras, chromosomal abnormalities at 9p21 and 9q31-32, and immunohistochemical reactions. The immunoreactivity of p53 was consistent in both adenocarcinomatous and squamous cell carcinomatous components as well as in the transitional areas, retaining the morphological characteristics of the distinct components. The same p53 mutation was found in both components of each tumor with p53 overexpression. No K-ras mutations were detected in any of the tumors examined. Three of the four tumors with chromosomal abnormalities detected, one at 9p21 and two at 9q31-32, had coincident abnormalities between the distinct components, whereas one tumor deleted homozygously at 9p21 (D9S259) in the adenocarcinomatous component with loss of heterozygosity in the other component. The expression of squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen in adenocarcinomatous components was significantly higher than that of lung adenocarcinomas (57 +/- 5.8% vs. 1.0 +/- 0.5%, P < 0.0001), whereas Mucin 1 expression is less in these components (9.0 +/- 4.9% vs. 55 +/- 8.2%, P = 0.003). These results suggest monoclonal transition from squamous cell carcinoma to adenocarcinoma in lung adenosquamous carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Bcl-2 and p53 gene products have been both linked to cell death by apoptosis. In the present study, we examined the relationship of Bcl-2 and p53 protein expression, p53 mutation and apoptosis in normal human ovaries and different types of human ovarian epithelial tumors by immunohistochemical localization, in situ terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism. It was found that Bcl-2 expressed strongly in the surface epithelium of normal ovaries and benign and borderline ovarian tumors but weakly in the malignant tumors. On the contrary, strong protein expression of p53 was found in 54% (25/46) of the malignant epithelial tumors examined but similar expression of p53 was not observed in borderline and benign tumors and normal ovarian surface epithelium. A significant inverse correlation between Bcl-2 and p53 expression was found in the malignant ovarian tumors examined. p53 gene mutation at exons 5-11 was however not a pre-requisite for p53 expression in both borderline and malignant tumors. Apoptotic activities, as reflected by apoptotic indices, were low in normal ovarian surface epithelium and benign tumors but were increased in borderline and malignant tumors, with the highest average apoptotic index found in grade III malignant tumors. Statistical analyses showed a positive correlation between apoptosis and p53 expression, but similar correlation was not found between apoptosis and Bcl-2 expression. Our results also indicate that although expression of Bcl-2 is important during ovarian carcinogenesis, the Bcl-2 protein may have other roles to play apart from being a modulator of apoptosis in human ovarian epithelial cancers",

    "Title": "Genetic profile of gliosarcomas",
    "Abstract": "There are distinct genetic pathways leading to the glioblastoma, the most malignant astrocytic brain tumor. Primary (de novo) glioblastomas develop in older patients and are characterized by epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor amplification/overexpression, p16 deletion, and PTEN mutations, whereas secondary glioblastomas that progressed from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma develop in younger patients and frequently contain p53 mutations. In this study, we assessed the genetic profile of gliosarcoma, a rare glioblastoma variant characterized by a biphasic tissue pattern with alternating areas displaying glial and mesenchymal differentiation. Single-strand conformation polymorphism followed by direct DNA sequencing revealed p53 mutations in five of 19 gliosarcomas (26%) and PTEN mutations in seven cases (37%). Homozygous p16 deletion was detected by differential polymerase chain reaction in seven (37%) gliosarcomas. The overall incidence of alterations in the Rb pathway (p16 deletion, CDK4 amplification, or loss of pRb immunoreactivity) was 53%, and these changes were mutually exclusive. Coamplification of CDK4 and MDM2 was detected in one gliosarcoma. None of the gliosarcomas showed amplification or overexpression of the EGF receptor. Thus gliosarcomas exhibit a genetic profile similar to that of primary (de novo) glioblastomas, except for the absence of EGFR amplification/overexpression. Identical PTEN mutations in the gliomatous and sarcomatous tumor components were found in two cases. Other biopsies contained p16 deletions, an identical p53 mutation, or coamplification of MDM2 and CDK4 in both tumor areas. This strongly supports the concept of a monoclonal origin of gliosarcomas and an evolution of the sarcomatous component due to aberrant mesenchymal differentiation in a highly malignant astrocytic neoplasm",

    "Title": "INK4a/ARF locus alterations in human non-Hodgkin's lymphomas mainly occur in tumors with wild-type p53 gene",
    "Abstract": "INK4a/ARF locus codes for two different proteins, p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), involved in cell cycle regulation. p14(ARF) is considered an upstream regulator of p53 function. To determine the role of these genes in the pathogenesis of human non-Hodgkin's lymphomas we have analyzed exon 1beta, 1alpha, and 2 of the INK4a/ARF locus and p53 gene aberrations in 97 tumors previously characterized for p16(INK4a) alterations. p53 alterations were detected in four of 51 (8%) indolent lymphomas but in 15 of 46 (33%) aggressive tumors. Inactivation of p14(ARF) was always associated with p16(INK4a) alterations. Exon 1beta was concomitantly deleted with exon 1alpha and 2 in eight tumors. One additional lymphoblastic lymphoma showed deletion of exon 1alpha and 2 but retained exon 1beta. No mutations were detected in exon 1alpha and 1beta in any case. Two of the three mutations detected in exon 2 caused a nonsense mutation in the p16(INK4a) reading frame and a missense mutation in the ARF reading frame involving the nucleolar transport domain of the protein. The third mutation was a missense mutation in the p16(INK4a) reading frame, but it was outside the coding region of p14(ARF). Aggressive lymphomas with p14(ARF) inactivation and p53 wild type showed a significantly lower p53 protein expression than tumors with no alteration in any of these genes. In this series of tumors, inactivation of the INK4a/ARF locus mainly occurred in tumors with a wild-type p53 gene because only two lymphomas showed simultaneous aberrations in these genes. Tumors with concomitant alterations of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF)/p53 genes seem to exhibit a worse clinical behavior than lymphomas with no alterations or isolated inactivation of any of these genes. These findings indicate that p14(ARF) genetic alterations occur in a subset of aggressive NHLs, but they are always associated with p16(INK4a) aberrations. Concomitant disruption of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF)/p53 regulatory pathways may have a cooperative effect in the progression of these tumors",

    "Title": "p53 mutations and expression in breast carcinoma in situ",
    "Abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor gene is altered in approximately half of human cancers. Although p53 mutations are common in invasive breast carcinoma, few have been identified in breast carcinoma in situ (intraductal breast carcinomas). Most studies of p53 in breast carcinoma in situ are immunohistochemical studies of p53 staining in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Few studies have isolated the tumor cells and subjected them to DNA sequence analysis. The current study was undertaken to characterize p53 in a cohort of breast carcinoma in situ cases, both with and without invasive disease. Fifty-eight frozen breast biopsy samples were used for these investigations. Twenty-seven cases had only ductal carcinoma in situ (CIS) and 31 cases had evidence of both invasive and in situ carcinoma. DNA sequence alterations in exons 2 through 11 of p53 were screened by the single-strand conformational polymorphism technique. Exons with altered mobility were sequenced. Among breast CIS cases without invasive disease, 22% had p53 mutations and 7% had DNA sequence alterations of unknown significance. Analysis of breast CIS with concurrent invasive disease demonstrated p53 mutations in 19% of cases and one (3%) DNA alteration of unknown significance. Each carcinoma having a p53 mutation in the breast CIS component had the identical mutation in the invasive component of the same tumor indicating a clonal relationship between the two tumor components. p53 protein overexpression was identified in 22% of pure intraductal breast carcinomas and in 35% of breast CIS with invasive disease. Comparison of immunostaining and DNA sequence alterations showed a significant association between overexpression and mutations (P = 0. 0037) in cases of CIS without invasion, and similarly between overexpression and mutations in cases of CIS with invasion (P = 0. 007). p53 mutations and p53 overexpression were relatively common in intraductal breast carcinomas but were not observed in adjacent normal breast lobules or ducts in 9 cases available for DNA analysis. The frequency of p53 alterations when comparing breast CIS with and without an invasive component indicated that p53 mutations usually occur before invasion during the progression of breast cancer, as is observed for a number of other adult solid tumors",

    "Title": "Different subtypes of human lung adenocarcinoma caused by different etiological factors. Evidence from p53 mutational spectra",
    "Abstract": "Human lung adenocarcinomas are only relatively weakly associated with tobacco smoke, and other etiological factors need to be clarified. These may also vary with the histopathology. Because the p53 mutation status (frequency and spectrum) of a carcinoma can provide clues to causative agents, we subclassified 113 adenocarcinomas into five cell types: hobnail, columnar/cuboidal, mixed, polygonal, and goblet (54, 23, 18, 13, and 5, respectively) and investigated relationships with p53 mutations and smoking history. In the hobnail cell type, a low mutational frequency (37%) and a high proportion of transitions (65%), especially G:C to A:T transitions at CpG dinucleotides (45%) associated with spontaneous mutations, were found with a weak relation to tobacco smoke. In contrast, a high mutation frequency (70%) with a higher proportion of transversions (50%), especially G:C to T:A (44%) on the nontranscribed DNA strand, caused by exogenous carcinogenic agents like tobacco smoke, were observed for the columnar cell type, as with squamous cell carcinomas. These results indicate that two major subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma exist, one probably caused by tobacco smoke, and the other possibly due to spontaneous mutations. For the prevention of lung adenocarcinomas, in addition to stopping tobacco smoking, the elucidation of endogenous mechanisms is important",

    "Title": "p53 alterations in recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck refractory to radiotherapy",
    "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of p53 alterations by mutation, deletion or inactivation by mdm2 or human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN) refractory to radiotherapy. Twenty-two tumours were studied. The p53 status of each tumour was analysed by sequencing of exons 4-9 and by immunohistochemistry. Mdm2 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and HPV infection was assessed by polymerase chain reaction of tumour DNA for HPV 16, 18 and 33. Fifteen (68%) of the 22 tumours studied had p53 mutations, while seven had wild-type p53 sequence. p53 immunohistochemistry correlated with the type of mutation. HPV DNA was detected in 8 (36%) tumours and all were of serotype HPV 16. Of these, five were in tumours with mutant p53 and three were in tumours with wild-type p53. Mdm2 overexpression was detected in 11 (50%) tumours. Of these, seven were in tumours with mutant p53 and four were in tumours with wild-type p53. Overall, 21 of the 22 tumours had p53 alterations either by mutation, deletion or inactivation by mdm2 or HPV. In this study, the overall incidence of p53 inactivation in recurrent head and neck cancer was very high at 95%. The main mechanism of inactivation was gene mutation or deletion which occurred in 15 of the 22 tumours studied. In addition, six of the seven tumours with wild-type p53 sequence had either HPV 16 DNA, overexpression of mdm2 or both which suggested that these tumours had p53 inactivation by these mechanisms. This high incidence of p53 dysfunction is one factor which could account for the poor response of these tumours to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Therefore, new therapies for recurrent SCCHN which either act in a p53 independent pathway, or which restore p53 function may be beneficial in this disease",

    "Title": "Spontaneous apoptosis in ovarian carcinomas: a positive association with p53 gene mutation is dependent on growth fraction",
    "Abstract": "Changes in cell survival contribute to tumour development, influence tumour biology and its response to chemotherapy. p53 gene alterations should negatively affect apoptosis by impaired p53-dependent apoptotic response. We looked for associations between spontaneous apoptosis, p53 gene mutation, p53 protein accumulation, growth fraction, bcl-2 expression and histological parameters in 64 ovarian, four tubal and three peritoneal carcinomas. Apoptotic cells were detected with the TUNEL method. p53 gene variants were detected by the single-strand conformation polymorphism and were sequenced directly. P53, Ki-67 and bcl-2 protein expressions were detected immunohistochemically. A weighed multiple logistic regression model was applied. Apoptotic index (AI) ranged 0.02-0.18 (mean 0.11); proliferation index (PI) ranged 3- 90% (mean 54%). p53 gene mutations were present in 51, p53 protein accumulation in 46, and diffuse bcl-2 expression in 29 of 71 tumours. The AI was positively associated with the presence of p53 gene mutation (P = 0.011). However, the PI included into the analysis did positively influence the AI (P = 0.02) and diminished the association with p53 gene mutation (P = 0.082). The AI was negatively associated with good histological differentiation (P = 0.0006), the serous tumour type (P = 0.002), and diffuse bcl-2 expression (P = 0.025). Strong bcl-2 expression was associated with endometrioid tumour type (P = 0.002). FIGO stage and p53 protein accumulation were the only parameters that influenced overall survival time. Thus, our results suggest that histological tumour type and grade are major determinants of spontaneous apoptosis in ovarian carcinomas; p53 alterations do not adversely but rather positively affect spontaneous apoptosis by increasing growth fraction. This, in turn, suggests p53-independency of spontaneous apoptosis in ovarian carcinomas",

The p73 protein shows structural and functional homology to p53. For these reasons, p73 was considered as a positional and functional candidate tumour suppressor gene. Thus far, mutation analysis has provided no evidence for involvement of p73 in oligodendrogliomas, lung carcinoma, oesophageal carcinoma, prostatic carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. In neuroblastoma, two mutations have been observed in a series of 140 tumours. In view of the occurrence of 1p deletions in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and the location of p73 we decided to search for mutations in the p73 gene in five MCC cell lines and ten MCC tumours to test potential tumour suppressor function for this gene in MCC. In view of the possible complementary functions of p73 and TP53 we also examined the status of the TP53 gene. Sequence analysis of the entire coding region of the p73 gene revealed previously reported polymorphisms in four MCCs. In one MCC tumour, a mis-sense mutation located in the NH2-terminal transactivation region of the p73 gene was found. These results show that p73, analogous to neuroblastoma, is infrequently mutated in MCC. This is also the first report in which the role of TP53 in MCC has been investigated by sequencing the entire coding region of TP53. TP53 mis- sense mutations and one non-sense mutation were detected in three of 15 examined MCCs, suggesting that TP53 mutations may play a role in the pathogenesis or progression of a subset of MCCs. Moreover, typical UVB induced C to T mutations were found in one MCC cell line thus providing further evidence for sun-exposure in the aetiology of this rare skin cancer",

    "Title": "Combined RAF1 protein expression and p53 mutational status provides a strong predictor of cellular radiosensitivity",
    "Abstract": "The tumour suppressor gene, p53, and genes coding for positive signal transduction factors can influence transit through cell-cycle checkpoints and modulate radiosensitivity. Here we examine the effects of RAF1 protein on the rate of exit from a G2/M block induced by gamma- irradiation in relation to intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity in human cell lines expressing wild-type p53 (wtp53) protein as compared to mutant p53 (mutp53) protein. Cell lines which expressed mutp53 protein were all relatively radioresistant and exhibited no relationship between RAF1 protein and cellular radiosensitivity. Cell lines expressing wtp53 protein, however, showed a strong relationship between RAF1 protein levels and the radiosensitivity parameter SF2. In addition, when post-irradiation perturbation of G2/M transit was compared using the parameter T50 (time after the peak of G2/M delay at which 50% of the cells had exited from a block induced by 2 Gy of irradiation), RAF1 was related to T50 in wtp53, but not mutp53, cell lines. Cell lines which expressed wtp53 protein and high levels of RAF1 had shorter T50s and were also more radiosensitive. These results suggest a cooperative role for wtp53 and RAF1 protein in determining cellular radiosensitivity in human cells, which involves control of the G2/M checkpoint",

    "Title": "Co-expression of p53 and bcl-2 may correlate to the presence of epstein- barr virus genome and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in nasopharyngeal carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been well documented in the aetiology of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), although its role as well as the genetic basis in the genesis of NPC have not been elucidated. The p53 gene mutations are infrequently found in NPC, but the expression of p53 protein, as well as bcl-2 oncoprotein, has been reported in a high percentage of cases, and also in association with EBV. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) has also been shown to be increased in NPC, suggesting its association among the overexpression of p53 and bcl-2 oncoprotein. We undertook this study to evaluate the correlation among these abnormalities in the development of NPC. The expression of p53 protein, bcl-2 oncoprotein, and the level of PCNA were investigated by immunohistochemistry in 53 patients with NPC. Twenty tissue samples from these patients were studied for p53 gene mutations by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing as well as EBV genomes by polymerase chain reaction. Among the 53 specimens, 42 (79%) showed expression of p53 protein and 40 (75%) gave positive result for bcl-2 oncoprotein. A significant association was found between p53 expression and bcl-2 oncoprotein (P=0.002; Fisher's exact test) with 68% of the patients showing coexpression of both markers. The PCNA labelling index in the 53 patients varied from 5% to 80%. High PCNA labelling index was frequently found in the patients with overexpression of p53 protein and bcl-2 oncoprotein. The PCNA index in patients with p53 expression was significant higher than in those without p53 expression (P=0.002). Of the 20 patients, p53 mutations were found in four cases. EBV genomes were detected in 14 cases of which 12 cases showed overexpression of both p53 and bcl-2 and one case with only p53 expression and one case with bcl-2 expression. EBV genomes were detected in two cases with p53 mutations. We conclude that EBV is the important etiologic factor in NPC which may be involved in p53 and bcl-2 overexpression. The mutant p53 protein is correlated to deregulation of PCNA. p53 mutations participate in a small proportion of the tumorigenesis",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations in Bowen's disease in Koreans: clustering in exon 5 and multiple mutations",
    "Abstract": "We analyzed the p53 protein expression and gene mutations to evaluate the role of ultraviolet radiation or other carcinogens, and possible racial differences in 17 samples from 12 Korean patients with Bowen's disease. A simple microdissection technique was used to collect the tumor cells selectively. p53 protein expression was found in eight of 17 (47%) samples. Abnormalities in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis were observed in 16 (94%) samples. A total of 14 missense mutations were detected in eight (47%) samples; 11 were clustered in exon 5 and the remaining three were located in exon 8. UV-like mutations were seen in five of 14 (36%) mutations, but no CC to TT transitions, UV-fingerprint mutations were observed. Multiple mutations were present in two cases and double mutation in a single case. Each lesion in multiple Bowen's disease showed different mutations and was suggested to be of different clonal origins. TP53-loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was detected in four out of 15 (27%) informative samples. Clustering of mutations in exon 5 suggests the role of another carcinogen in Koreans or Asians other than the UVR. Microdissection would increase the detection rate of the p53 gene mutations and LOH not only in skin cancer but also in precancerous lesions",

    "Title": "Mutations of p53 tumor suppressor gene, apoptosis, and proliferation in intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma of the liver",
    "Abstract": "This study was performed to examine the correlation between mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, the occurrence of apoptosis, and proliferation in cholangiocellular carcinoma of the liver. The results obtained were compared with pathohistological stage (according to UICC) and grade and with disease related survival rate. In 41 curatively (R0- ) resected intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinomas, the status of the p53 gene was determined by direct sequencing of exons 4-9 and immunohistochemically. Apoptosis was assessed using the in situ end labeling (ISEL) technique in combination with morphological criteria. Proliferation was analyzed by immunohistochemistry of MIB-1 (Ki-67), Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and silver-stained nucleolar organizer regions (AgNOR). The results obtained were compared with pathohistological stage (according to UICC), grade, several other histopathological factors, and survival rate. Mutations of p53 were detected in 15/41 carcinomas examined (37%). The most common change was a G-->C and C-->T transition, changing the hot spot amino acid determined by exons 4-8. Of these 15 tumors, 14 were also p53-positive by immunohistochemistry. In each carcinoma examined, we could demonstrate MIB-1, PCNA, and AgNOR dots and also apoptotic cells in variable proportions. The proliferation markers showed a significant correlation among themselves. In univariate survival analysis, the extent of the primary tumor, lymph node status, grade, and p53 were significant factors influencing patient survival. Performing multivariate Cox regression survival analysis, however, only the extent of primary tumor and lymph node status had an independent prognostic impact. Apoptosis was not related to patient prognosis or to other parameters examined. In conclusion, these results indicated that p53 could serve as an additional prognostic parameter that could provide auxiliary information for patient outcome. However, tumor stage and lymph node involvement were the strongest prognostic factors. We failed to establish apoptosis or other pathological parameters as factors predicting the prognosis of patients with cholangiocellular carcinoma",

In contrast, none of the 68 benign pleomorphic adenomas had nuclear staining exceeding 10%. SSCP and nucleotide sequence analysis of exons 4 to 9 of p53 in 19 malignant tumors revealed 9 mutations in 7 tumors.

    "Abstract": "Functional defects in DNA mismatch repair genes have been shown to be associated mainly with hereditary human malignancies. We examined genomic DNA from 88 sporadic transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) of the urinary tract for mutations in hMSH6 gene by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing analysis. Mutational status of p53 gene was also studied as a potential target of genetic instability secondary to hMSH6 dysfunction. A total of 5 cases (5.7%: 5/88) displayed hMSH6 mutations all consisted of transition and located in exon 4, including three cases with missense mutation and two without change of corresponding amino acid. These three tumors with hMSH6 missense mutation had no microsatellite instability with five microsatellite markers tested. p53 gene mutations were detected in 22 cases (25.0%: 22/88). No tumors with p53 mutation had any hMSH6 missense mutations. Compared to the cases without hMSH6 alterations, the three patients with hMSH6 alterations had more frequent additional primary cancer (P<0.05). These findings provide the first in vivo evidence for the type of alterations and frequency of possible involvement of the hMSH6 mutations in sporadic type urothelial TCCs",

    "Title": "Mutation profile of the p53, fhit, p16INK4a/p19ARF and H-ras genes in Indian breast carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the second most prevalent cancer affecting Indian women. Genetic alterations of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were attributed to the development of breast carcinomas. In the present study, human breast tumor DNAs from untreated, non-familial, Indian patients were analysed for the presence of mutations in p53, fhit, p16INK4a/p19ARF and H-ras genes. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analysis were used to detect point mutations. Exons 5-8 of p53, exons 1-2 of p16INK4a, exon 2 of p19ARF, exons 5-9 of fhit gene and exons 1-2 of H-ras genes were amplified and analysed individually using exon-flanking primers. Only 12% of the tumors had mutation in p53, 8% had mutation in fhit gene and none of the tumors showed evidence for mutation in p16INK4a/p19ARF and H-ras genes. Tumor B18 exhibited two novel mutations in the p53 gene, ATGright curved arrow GTG (Metright curved arrow Val) at codon 237 and AATright curved arrow GAT (Asnright curved arrow Asp) at codon 263. Both of these mutations are hitherto unreported in breast carcinomas. Tumor B20 had a non-sense mutation CGAright curved arrow TGA (Argright curved arrow Stop) at codon 306 of p53 gene. In fhit gene, tumor B1 exhibited TTCTright curved arrow TACT mutation at intron 8 and tumor B15 had a silent mutation GAGright curved arrow GAA (Gluright curved arrow Glu) at codon 123. Our results indicate that, among the genes analysed, the p53 gene was more frequently mutated than fhit, p16INK4a/p19ARF and H-ras genes in Indian mammary tumors. Transcribable point mutations of fhit gene were found to be extremely uncommon in these tumors. Mutations in the above genes are mutually exclusive and are infrequent in fhit, p16INK4a/p19ARF and H-ras genes suggesting that these genes may not play a major role in Indian breast carcinomas. However, the significant frequency of mutations in the p53 gene suggest that p53 could be one of the genes involved in the genesis of sporadic breast carcinomas in Indian women",

    "Abstract": "Only a few human malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST)-cell lines have been reported, and their characteristics have not been fully established. In this study, we established a new human cell line, HS-Sch-2, from an MPNST of the ordinary type which arose in a 54-year-old woman without von Recklinghausen's disease. This cell line was characterized by chromosome analysis, immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural examination, and direct sequencing of the p53 gene. The HS-Sch-2 cells have grown for more than 48 months in vitro, and exhibited hypotriploid karyotypes with complex chromosome abnormalities lacking a specific pattern. Histological features of the heterotranplanted nude mouse tumours were essentially the same as those of the original MPNST, with positive reactions for S-100 protein and neuron-specific enolase but not for epithelial membrane antigen, fibronectin or CD34. Ultrastructural examination in vivo revealed intricate interdigitation of long cytoplasmic processes and basal lamina-like structures. In addition, direct sequencing of the p53 gene detected a point mutation from CGT to CAT at codon 273 in exon 8. This HS-Sch-2 cell line, which exhibits distinctive morphological characteristics of MPNST and a p53 point mutation, will be useful for biological and pathological investigations of MPNST",

    "Title": "Long survival and therapeutic responses in patients with histologically disparate high-grade gliomas demonstrating chromosome 1p loss",
    "Abstract": "OBJECT: Allelic loss of chromosome 1p is a powerful predictor of tumor chemosensitivity and prolonged survival in patients with anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Chromosome 1p loss also occurs in astrocytic and oligoastrocytic gliomas, although less commonly than in pure oligodendroglial tumors. This observation raises the possibility investigated in this study that chromosome 1p loss might also provide prognostic information for patients with high-grade gliomas with astrocytic components. METHODS: The authors report on seven patients with high-grade gliomas composed of either pure astrocytic or mixed astrocytic-oligodendroglial phenotypes, who had remarkable neuroradiological responses to therapy or unexpectedly long survivals. All of the tumors from these seven patients demonstrated chromosome 1p loss, whereas other genetic alterations characteristic of high-grade gliomas (p53 gene mutations, EGFR gene amplification, chromosome 10 loss, chromosome 19q loss, or CDKN2A/p16 deletions) were only found in occasional cases. The authors also assessed the frequency of chromosome 1p loss in a series of anonymous high-grade astrocytoma samples obtained from a tumor bank and demonstrate that this genetic change is uncommon, occurring in only 10% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Although any prognostic importance of chromosome 1p loss in astrocytic or mixed astrocytic-oligodendroglial gliomas can only be determined in larger and prospective series, these findings raise the possibility that some high-grade gliomas with chromosome 1p loss, in addition to pure anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, may follow a more favorable clinical course",

    "Abstract": "Classification of high grade astrocytomas of children into genetic subtypes similar to the adult remains to be defined. Here we report an extensive characterization of 29 high grade pediatric astrocytomas, 7 WHO grade III and 22 WHO grade IV, for genetic alterations frequently observed in high grade adult astrocytomas occurring in either the p53/MDM2/p14ARF or Rb/CDK4/p16INK4a tumor suppressor pathways. In addition, we have assessed the contribution of EGFR overexpression and amplification and LOH for chromosome 10, two genetic alterations commonly associated with the development of de novo adult glioblastoma for their roles in the development of de novo astrocytomas of childhood. Our results suggest two major differences in the genetic pathway(s) leading to the formation of de novo high grade astrocytomas in children compared with those of the adult. Our findings show preferential inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway in &gt;95% of pediatric astrocytomas versus inactivation of the Rb tumor suppressor pathway in &lt;25% of the same tumors. In addition, de novo high grade pediatric astrocytomas lack amplification of the EGFR gene compared with EGFR amplification in one-third of adult glioblastomas. Since drug treatments and gene therapy strategies exploit specific genetic alterations in tumor cells, our findings have important implications for the future development of treatments for high grade pediatric astrocytomas",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutation, tumor p53 protein overexpression, and serum p53 autoantibody generation in patients with breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Autoantibodies against the p53 tumor suppressor protein have been detected in the serum of a proportion of patients with various cancers. The generation of such antibodies has been proposed to be due to either tumor p53 protein accumulation or to the type of p53 gene mutation. These hypotheses are examined in the present study. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using immunofluorometric assays, we studied 195 patients with primary breast cancer for the presence of p53 antibodies in serum and p53 protein accumulation in the corresponding tumor. Seventeen patients (9%) were p53 antibody-positive and 77 (40%) overexpressed p53. Ten of the 17 p53 antibody-positive patients had tumor p53 accumulation and 7 were negative for p53. Statistical analysis revealed a weak association between the presence of p53 antibodies and p53 protein accumulation (p = 0.05). Direct DNA sequencing of exons 1-11 of the p53 gene was performed for 16 p53 antibody-positive and 16 p53 antibody-negative patients. RESULTS: Five of the seropositive and eight of the seronegative patients had a p53 gene mutation. Four of the five mutations in the p53 antibody-positive patients affected a Tyr residue, whereas none of the gene abnormalities in the seronegative patients had such an effect. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that p53 antibodies tend to develop in patients with tumor p53 accumulation, but p53 accumulation is neither sufficient nor necessary for the generation of the immune response. Further, p53 antibody- positive patients do not have higher frequency of p53 gene mutations than p53 antibody-negative patients, but the former patient group is associated with a Tyr substitution in the protein product",

    "Abstract": "Previous studies on the prognostic significance of TP53 gene alterations in colorectal cancer (CRC) have led to conflicting results. The present study investigated the prognostic significance of TP53 gene mutation in a very large series of 995 Dukes' B and C CRC patients, the majority of whom did not receive chemotherapy. Mutations were found in 385 (39%) cases and were not associated with tumour stage, histological grade, patient age or sex. Significantly more mutations were found in tumours from the left-sided colon compared with those from the right side (43% versus 34%, P=0.006). TP53 gene mutation had no prognostic value in the overall series or in different site or stage subgroups. None of the different types of TP53 gene mutation showed prognostic value. A trend for association with worse survival was observed in the patient subgroup that received adjuvant chemotherapy (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89-2.21, P=0.15). These results indicate that mutation of the TP53 gene is not a useful prognostic marker for CRC patients who do not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Further study is required to determine whether different types of TP53 mutation might be of value in predicting the response of CRC patients to chemotherapy",

    "Title": "Distinct prognostic values of p53 mutations and loss of estrogen receptor and their cumulative effect in primary breast cancers",
    "Abstract": "A total of 76 primary breast cancers were screened for p53 mutations using the yeast p53 functional assay, and the mutations were determined by DNA sequencing. Clonal mutations of p53 were detected in 30 tumors (39%). Immunohistochemical staining for nuclear p53 accumulation performed on the yeast assay-positive cases clearly differentiated missense mutations in the DNA binding domain (contact mutant; 17 cases) as positive stain and nonsense-type mutations or missense mutations that may affect 3D-structure of p53 protein (structural mutant; 13 cases) as negative stain. Enzyme immunoassay revealed loss of estrogen receptor in 36 tumors (50%). Prognostic values of p53 mutation and loss of estrogen receptor were evaluated after a median follow-up period of 44 months. p53 mutations were associated with a short overall survival (log rank test, p = 0.0319), whereas it was not related to disease-free (recurrence-free) survival. Contact mutants were associated with slightly shorter survival compared with structural mutants. Inversely, loss of estrogen receptor was associated with early recurrence (p = 0.0461) but not with short overall survival. The patients with tumors harboring both p53 mutation and loss of estrogen receptor had the poorest outcome (p = 0.0019 and 0.0075 for overall and disease-free survivals, respectively), suggesting independent and additive effects of the 2 factors. The independent role of the 2 factors was confirmed by a multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model stratified according to clinical tumor stages. Although preliminary, due to the small number of patients studied and the relatively short follow-up time, our results suggest that p53 mutations and loss of estrogen receptor cooperatively affect the prognosis of primary breast cancer patients",

    "Title": "Clinical significance of p53 functional loss in squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx",
    "Abstract": "We examined the frequency of p53 mutations in 38 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), using both a yeast functional assay and a conventional immunohistochemical staining method (IHC) to detect p53 mutations.We also explored the clinical importance of p53 mutations in oropharyngeal SCC. An accumulation of p53 protein was detected in 17 of the 38 (45%) tumors by IHC, whereas the yeast-based assay detected 6 additional p53 mutations, for a total of 23 tumors (61%) with p53 mutations. The cDNA sequencing analysis revealed that the 6 mutations undetected by IHC consisted of 3 frameshift, 1 nonsense and 2 missense mutations. Thus, the yeast functional assay was more sensitive than conventional IHC for detecting p53 mutations. Subsequently, the relationship between p53 mutations and the clinico-pathological parameters in oropharyngeal SCC was evaluated using the results of the functional assay. Mutation of p53 was not associated with the patient age, sex, tumor stage or degree of tumor cell differentiation. Interestingly, heavy drinking had a significant positive correlation with the p53 mutation, but heavy smoking did not, suggesting that prolonged exposure to alcohol is more related to p53 mutation in oropharyngeal SCC than to tobacco consumption. Radiation sensitivity was examined by comparing tumor size on magnetic resonance images before and after completion of therapy with 45 Gy radiation, in the 18 cases of T2 oropharyngeal SCC that were initially treated by radiotherapy. The results showed that tumors with wild-type p53 decreased in size significantly compared to those with mutant p53. In 33 patients treated with curative intent, the overall survival after the completion of therapy was better in patients with a wild-type p53 tumor than in patients with a mutant p53 tumor. We conclude that p53 mutation is associated with radiation resistance and a decreased probability of survival in oropharyngeal SCC. Copyright 2000 Wiley- Liss, Inc",

Mutations of TP53 are frequent in SCCE, and there is evidence that both the frequency and type of these mutations may differ from one geographic area to the other. Although SCCE is relatively rare in most parts of Thailand, the province of Songkhla (south Thailand) has been described as a high-risk area for SCCE. We have analyzed 56 SCCE cases from this area for TP53 mutations by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE, exons 5-8) and direct DNA sequencing. The same tumors were also analyzed for MDM2 gene amplification by differential PCR. TP53 mutations were detected in 23 cases (41%). In contrast, clear amplification of MDM2 was detected in only 2 cases (4%), both of which contained wild-type TP53. Comparison with published results from other geographic areas of high SCCE incidence revealed that the spectrum of TP53 mutations in south Thailand is similar to that observed in central China (Henan Province) but clearly differs from that of SCCE from western Europe (Normandy, France; northern Italy), with more G:T transversions and fewer mutations affecting A and T base pairs. These results suggest that SCCE from south Thailand and from central China may involve similar risk factors",

    "Title": "p53 mutational spectra are different between squamous-cell carcinomas of the lip and the oral cavity",
    "Abstract": "We studied the p53 mutational spectra of 34 lip and 60 intra-oral squamous-cell carcinomas and examined possible etiological and prognostic correlations for these tumor sites. For the p53 analysis of exons 5-8, we used PCR/TGGE screening followed by DNA sequencing. Mutations were found in 18/34 (53%) lip and 22/60 (38%) intra-oral carcinomas. The p53 mutational spectrum of the intra-oral carcinomas comprised transitions and transversions in nearly equal frequency (11 to 10). In comparison, transitions were 3.5 times more frequent than transversions (14 to 4) in carcinomas of the lip. The predominant types of base change found in intra-oral tumors were G:C-to-T:A transversions and G:C-to-A:T transitions (32% each), while in lip tumors G:C-to-A:T transitions (70%) were the most frequent. The rate of lip tumors with mutations was higher in non-smokers (8/13) than in smokers (9/20). In contrast, p53 mutations in intra-oral tumors clustered in smokers (18/47 vs. 2/10). G:C-to-T:A transversions, regarded as tobacco smoke- associated in lung cancer, were found in 2 moderate and 4 heavy smokers with intra-oral cancer. This base substitution was found in none of our lip cancers. In lip tumors, a high rate of mutations occurred at dipyridine sites (13/18); among these were 8 C-to-T transitions and 1 CC-to-TT tandem base transition. These changes are characteristic of DNA damage caused by UV light. The presence of mutational events at the DNA-binding surface of the p53 protein may correlate with poor clinical outcome. However, we could not find any statistically significant correlations between p53 status and survival. Only the recurrence-free interval was significantly shortened in cases with mutations affecting residues of the DNA-binding surface of the p53 protein",

    "Title": "Detection of tumor cells in blood using CD45 magnetic cell separation followed by nested mutant allele-specific amplification of p53 and K- ras genes in patients with colorectal cancer",
    "Abstract": "A new method for detecting circulating tumor cells that is based on magnetic-activated cell separation (MACS) and nested mutant allele- specific amplification (nested MASA) was evaluated in patients with colorectal cancer using the p53 and K-ras genes as genetic markers. By negative selection with anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody-conjugated supermagnetic microbeads, the proportion of tumor cells was enriched 9- fold. By the combination of MACS and nested MASA, 10 tumor cells in 10(7) normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells could be detected without false-positives. Using this method, we examined blood taken from the tumor drainage veins of 23 patients with colorectal cancer. Eighty-seven percent (20/23) of primary tumor tissues showed p53 and/or K-ras gene mutations. Forty-five percent (9/20) of patients with p53 and/or K-ras mutations in the primary tumor showed the same mutated genes in the blood samples. There was a significant association between the presence of p53 and K-ras gene mutation in the blood and tumor size, depth of invasion, and venous invasion. Blood gene mutation was detected in 80% (4/5) of samples from patients with synchronous liver metastases. Sixty percent (3/5) of patients with mutant genes in the blood developed asynchronous liver metastases after surgery. The overall survival of patients with p53 and/or K-ras gene mutation- positive findings in blood was significantly shorter than that of patients testing negative on Kaplan-Meier analysis. Our results suggest that the method may be useful for reliable detection of tumor cells circulating in the blood and may help to identify patients at high risk for relapse",

    "Title": "Oncogenic aberrations in the p53 pathway are associated with a high S phase fraction and poor patient survival in B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "The implications of aberrations in the p53 pathway for induction of apoptosis and regulation of S phase entry, and for patient survival, were investigated in 83 B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Eight cases had missense mutations in exons 5, 7, 8 and 9 as revealed by constant denaturant gel electrophoresis and sequencing. Fifteen cases had lost 1 TP53 allele as revealed by fluorescent in situ hybridization and comparative genomic hybridization. Ten cases expressed high levels of p53 as assessed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. S phase fractions were higher, apoptotic fractions were the same and survival times were shorter in all aberration groups compared with the cases with no TP53/p53 aberrations. Since many tumors had more than one TP53/p53 aberration, the tumors were divided into groups with the following characteristics: no TP53/p53 aberrations; loss of one TP53 allele only (9 cases), TP53 point mutation (8 cases), high-level p53 expression and no TP53 mutation (3 cases). Tumors from the 3 latter groups had higher median S phase fractions (5%, 7.6%, and 5%, respectively, p<0.02) than the cases without any aberrations (1.1%), and survival time for these patients was much shorter (relative risks of 5.9, 8.9, and 6.6, respectively, p<0.003). Apoptotic fractions were similar in all these groups (p=0.09). Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of TP53/p53 aberrations is a strong and independent prognostic parameter in B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma",

    "Title": "p53 protein accumulation and mutations in normal and benign breast tissue",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 gene are amongst the most common molecular changes detected in breast cancer, and there are several reports suggesting that changes in p53 may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. In a previous case-control study, we demonstrated that p53 protein accumulation detected by immunohistochemistry in normal or benign breast tissue was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in the risk of subsequent breast cancer. In this study, we investigated whether p53 gene mutations were present in the 29 p53 immunopositive normal or benign breast tissue samples and in 15 p53 immunonegative normal or benign breast tissue samples selected randomly from the original study. DNA was extracted from paraffin sections and underwent PCR-SSCP analysis for exons 4 to 10. PCR products that showed abnormal mobility were excised and sequenced. Sixteen (59.2%) of the 27 immunopositive breast tissue samples and 4 (26.7%) of the 15 immunonegative samples had p53 sequence changes. There was no obvious association between the occurrence of these alterations and any specific histopathologic features. Ten cases showed p53 mutations, and they were all missense base substitutions of the transition type. Thirteen other gene changes occurred in 11 breast tissue samples and consisted of 8 silent (no amino acid change), 4 intronic alterations, and 1 indeterminate alteration. One individual had both a mutation and a silent change. In summary, p53 gene alterations can occur in normal or benign breast tissue, but resolution of their role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer will require long-term follow-up studies involving comparisons of breast cancer occurrence in patients with and without p53 mutations as well as functional assays to determine their significance",

    "Title": "Mutation analysis of replicative genes encoding the large subunits of DNA polymerase alpha and replication factors A and C in human sporadic colorectal cancers",
    "Abstract": "We examined cDNAs of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase alpha (185 kDa), the 70 kDa subunit of replication protein A (single-stranded DNA- binding protein) and the 140 kDa subunit of replication factor C for mutations. Surgical specimens from 12 patients with sporadic colon cancer and normal mucosae from the same patients were investigated. In addition, we analyzed 3 human colon cancer cell lines that exhibited defects in mismatch repair (DLD-1, HCT116, SW48) and 3 colon cancer cell lines without such a defect (HT29, SW480 and SW620). For detection of mutations, we used reverse transcription of mRNA, amplification of cDNAs by PCR, analysis of single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing. Eleven colon cancers and 6 colon cancer cell lines were analyzed for DNA polymerase alpha. Only 2 silent point mutations were detected, in 1 colon carcinoma and in cell line HCT116. Two sequence alterations of the 70 kDa subunit of replication factor A were identified in 15 specimens (9 colon carcinomas and 6 cell lines). Colon carcinomas from 2 patients (CC5MA and CC25HN) exhibited an ACA-->GCA transition in codon 351, which caused a Thr-->Ala exchange. In carcinomas CC5MA and CC8MA, a TCC-->TCT (Ser-->Ser) transition in codon 352 was observed. The deviations in codons 351 and 352 occurred in both cancer tissues and normal mucosae, suggesting a genetic polymorphism. No mutation was found in the 140 kDa subunit of replication factor C from 16 specimens (10 tumors and 6 cell lines). Point mutations were identified in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene in 4 of the 6 colon cancer cell lines and 3 of the 8 carcinoma specimens. We did not find tumor- associated DNA sequence alterations that resulted in amino acid changes in the DNA replication genes analyzed. We infer that the scarcity of mutations found is due to stringent selection, eliminating functionally impaired replication proteins",

    "Abstract": "Esophageal cancer (EC) in the Indian population presents in advanced stages with poor prognosis and warrants the identification of a non- invasive marker for early detection and better prognostic assessment. We have previously reported high prevalence of p53 protein accumulation in esophageal squamous-cell carcinomas (ESCCs). The present study was designed to determine (i) if esophageal cancer patients elicit a humoral immune response to intra-tumoral p53 protein accumulation and (ii) their relationship with p53 gene mutations. The goal was to compare the cellular events, p53 protein accumulation and gene mutations with the presence of serum anti-p53 antibodies (p53-Abs) and to assess the utility of serological p53-Ab analysis as a surrogate marker for p53 alterations in esophageal cancer. A high prevalence of circulating p53-Abs was observed in 36 of 60 (60%) ESCC patients. In a subset of 44 ESCCs, exons 5-9 of the p53 gene were examined for mutations by PCR and direct sequencing of PCR products. Mutational data have been correlated with p53-Abs and p53 protein accumulation in ESCCs. Circulating p53-Abs in ESCC patients were significantly associated with intra-tumoral p53 protein accumulation (p=0.0005). A strong correlation observed between humoral immune response against p53 protein, missense gene mutations and protein accumulation warrants the application of serological p53-Abs as a non-invasive surrogate marker in screening high-risk populations for early detection of malignancy",

    "Title": "p53 gene status as a predictor of tumor response to induction chemotherapy of patients with locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine whether p53 gene status predicts tumor responses to platinum- and fluorouracil-based induction chemotherapy in locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor responses of 105 patients were measured at the primary tumor site. Objective response and major response were defined by a 50% and 80% reduction in tumor size, respectively. All coding parts of p53 gene were directly sequenced. p53 expression in tumor cells was determined by immunohistochemistry. Human papillomavirus infection was detected by polymerase chain reaction. Odd ratios were adjusted by stepwise logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: p53 mutations, p53 expression, and tumor stage were sufficient to explain the variation in tumor responses to chemotherapy in multivariate models. p53 mutation was the only variable to significantly predict objective response (odds ratio, 0. 23; 95% confidence interval, 0.10 to 0.57; P =.002) and was the strongest predictor of major response (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.74; P =.006). p53 expression (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.98) and tumor stage (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.10 to 0.96) also predicted major response. Specific mutations (contact mutations) accounted for much of the reduction in the risk of major response associated with overall mutations. In complementary analyses, p53 expression was weakly predictive of major response in the subgroup with wild-type p53, and p53 mutations also predicted histologic response. CONCLUSION: p53 gene mutations are strongly associated with a poor risk of both objective and major responses to chemotherapy. Contact mutations are associated with the lowest risk of major response to chemotherapy",

    "Title": "p53 alterations predict tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a prospective series",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The tumor suppressor gene p53 plays a crucial role in cell cycle control and apoptosis in response to DNA damages. p53 gene mutations and allelic losses at 17p are one of the most common genetic alterations in primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Alterations of the p53 gene have been shown to contribute to carcinogenesis and drug resistance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective series, patients with HNSCC were treated with cisplatin- fluorouracil neoadjuvant chemotherapy. p53 status was characterized in 106 patients with HNSCC (p53 mutations, allelic losses at p53 locus, and plasma anti-p53 antibodies) to determine the existence of a relationship between p53 gene status and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Exons 4 to 9 of the p53 gene were analyzed, and mutations were found in 72 of 106 patients with HNSCC. p53 mutations were associated with loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 17p (P <.001). The prevalence of p53-mutated tumors was higher in the group of patients with nonresponse to neoadjuvant chemotherapy than in the group of responders (81% v 61%, respectively; P <.04). When compiling p53 mutations and anti-p53 antibodies in plasma, the correlation between p53 status and response to chemotherapy was significant (87% v 57%, respectively; P =.003). A multivariate analysis showed that p53 status is an independent predictive factor of response to chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This prospective study suggests that p53 status may be a useful indicator of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HNSCC",

    "Title": "p53 gene status and response to platinum/paclitaxel-based chemotherapy in advanced ovarian carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The p53 gene plays a critical role in cellular response to DNA damage and has been implicated in the response to platinum compounds in ovarian carcinoma patients. Because taxanes could induce p53- independent apoptosis, we assessed the relevance of p53 gene status to response in ovarian carcinoma patients receiving paclitaxel and platinum-containing chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight previously untreated patients with advanced disease received standard paclitaxel/platinum-based chemotherapy. In tumor specimens collected at the time of initial surgery, before therapy, p53 gene status and expression were examined by single-strand conformation polymorphism, sequence analysis, and immunohistochemical analysis. Microsatellite instability analysis was performed on available samples from 30 patients. RESULTS: Thirty-four (71%) of the 48 patients had a clinical response. Pathologic complete remission was documented in 13 (27%) of 48 patients. p53 mutations were detected in 29 (60%) of 48 tumors. Among the patients with mutant p53 tumors, 25 patients (86%) responded to chemotherapy. Only nine (47%) of 19 patients with wild-type p53 tumors responded to the same treatment. The overall response rate and the complete remission rate were significantly higher among patients with mutant p53 tumors than among patients with wild-type p53 tumors (P: =.008). Most of the tested tumors not associated with complete remission (10 of 12 tumors) were also characterized by microsatellite instability. The complete remission rate was higher among patients with tumors without microsatellite instability (five of seven patients). CONCLUSION: In contrast to the limited efficacy of treatment with paclitaxel in combination with standard platinum doses against wild- type p53 ovarian tumors, patients with mutant p53 ovarian tumors were more responsive to paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. The pattern of response to chemotherapy containing paclitaxel is different from that associated with high-dose cisplatin therapy. Determining p53 mutational status can be useful in predicting therapeutic response to drugs effective in ovarian carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: t(8;14)(q24;q32) and/or c-MYC/immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGH) fusion gene have been observed not only in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) but also in a proportion of non-BL, diffuse large-cell lymphoma of B-cell type (DLCL). We explored molecular features of DLCL with c-MYC/IGH fusion and the impact of this genetic abnormality on clinical outcome of DLCL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 203 cases of non-BL DLCL were studied. Genomic DNA extracted from tumor tissues was subjected to long- distance polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR) using oligonucleotide primers for exon 2 of c-MYC and for the four constant region genes of IGH. RESULTS: Twelve cases (5.9%) showed positive amplification; one had a c-MYC/Cmicro, nine had a c-MYC/Cgamma, and two had a c-MYC/Calpha fusion sequence. Restriction and sequence analysis of the LD-PCR products, ranging from 2.3 to 9.4 kb in size, showed that breakage in the 12 cases occurred within a 1.5-kb region that included exon 1 of c- MYC in combination with breakpoints at the switch regions of IGH (10 of 12). In 10 cases, Myc protein encoded by the fusion genes demonstrated mutations and/or deletions. Six cases had additional molecular lesions in BCL-2 or BCL-6 and/or p53 genes. The age range of the 12 patients was 44 to 86 years, with a median age of 65.5 years. Five patients had stage I/II disease, and seven had stage III/IV disease. Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in nine of 11 subjects. Seven showed involvement of the gastrointestinal tract. All patients were treated by surgery and/or chemoradiotherapy; six died of the disease within 1 year, resulting in the poorest 1- and 2-year survival rates among DLCL subgroups. CONCLUSION: The c-MYC/IGH fusion gene of DLCL is identical to that of the sporadic type of BL (sBL). DLCL with c-MYC/IGH shares clinical features with sBL but is characterized further by an older age distribution",

    "Title": "Analysis of the p300/CBP-Associated Factor (PCAF) gene in astrocytic tumors",
    "Abstract": "The PCAF gene encodes the p300/CBP-Associated Factor (PCAF), a histone acetyltransferase, which regulates p53 by acetylation of Lys320 in the C-terminal portion of p53. While the p53 gene is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in human tumors, such mutations occur in only 30% of astrocytic tumors. Since PCAF can regulate p53 activity, abrogation of PCAF function by PCAF gene mutation could be an alternate mechanism to inactivate the p53 pathway in tumors lacking p53 mutations. To test this hypothesis, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the entire PCAF coding region in 37 astrocytic tumors (17 glioblastomas, 10 anaplastic astrocytomas, 7 low- grade astrocytomas, and 3 pilocytic astrocytomas). We detected two single-nucleotide alterations that represented non-deleterious polymorphisms (GAG > GAA Glu103Glu, AAT > AGT Asn386Ser) but no obvious functional mutations. Moreover, the frequency of the Asn386Ser allele that contained Ser386 in glioma patients was not statistically different from its frequency in individuals without disease, and no significant association was observed between the PCAF polymorphisms and the presence or absence of p53 mutations in the tumors. We conclude that the PCAF gene is not mutated during the development of the astrocytic tumors studied here",

    "Abstract": "Malignant gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumors. Recent studies defined several genetic markers, which might characterize molecular-biological subsets of glioblastomas with probably prognostic implications. To elucidate the involvement of murine-double-minute (mdm)2 gene amplifications and mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in the tumorigenesis of malignant gliomas we analyzed a series of 75 glioblastomas. The p53 mutations occur in one-third of glioblastomas, mdm2 amplifications were found in 13% of cases. Our analysis revealed a hot spot in the p53 gene locus in codon 156, the same point mutation was detected in 4 tumor samples. None of the mdm2 amplified tumors had p53 mutations, supporting the hypothesis, that mdm2 amplifications are alternative mechanisms for p53 inactivation. Patients with p53 mutated tumors were significantly younger characterized by a mean age of 44 years. Additionally association with longer overall survival could be detected for this subgroup of patients. In our study, survival estimation revealed a significant correlation of mdm2 gene amplification with shorter survival time, and support the hypothesis, that mdm2 oncogene activation appears to occur late in tumor progression and may be characteristic as negative prognostic marker",

Our aim was to identify aberrations of the K-ras, p53, and APC genes in EHBD cancer. METHODS: We investigated aberrations of these genes in 52 EHBD cancers using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, followed by direct sequence determination and a PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. RESULTS: The K-ras, p53, and APC genes were mutated in 9.6%, 32.7%, and 0% of EHBD cancers, respectively. Loss of heterozygosity at the p53 and APC gene loci was identified in 15.6% and 38.5% of EHBD cancers, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an unknown suppressor gene on 5q other than the APC gene may be responsible for EHBD cancer",

    "Title": "[P53 gene mutation in gallbladder cancer]",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer frequency and mortality renders it one of the most important neoplastic diseases in Chile. P53 tumor suppressor gene has been studied in most types of cancer, but there is scarce information about it in gallbladder cancer. AIM: To study the frequency of P53 gene mutation in gallbladder cancer in the ninth region of Chile. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 25 pathological samples of gallbladder cancer, the direct amplification and sequencing of p53 gene exons 5,6,7,8-8 was possible. RESULTS: Seventeen punctual mutations were observed in 13 cases (52%). There were 10 transitions, 5 transversions, one insertion (codon 194) and one deletion (codon 186). Eight cases had mutations in exon 5, six had mutations in exon 6, two had mutations in exon 7 and one had mutations in exons 8-9. In 14 of 25 cases, gene p53 protein was positive. When immunohistochemical expression of gene p53 protein was positive in more than 20% of cells, there was a high correlation between genetic alterations and immunohistochemical expression of the protein, with a specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values over 80%. CONCLUSIONS: P53 gene mutation is observed in a high proportion of gallbladder cancers at it can be accurately detected with conventional immunohistochemical techniques. The importance of this gene in the genesis of this carcinoma should be determined studying preneoplastic lesions and early carcinomas",

    "Title": "Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma: a clinical, histological, phenotypic and genotypic study of 21 cases",
    "Abstract": "The clinical, histological, phenotypic and genotypic features of 21 primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCLs) have been investigated. The patients were 13 men and eight women aged 34-91 years (median 67) at diagnosis. Eighteen patients had localized disease, and three had multiple skin lesions at diagnosis. Twelve patients developed cutaneous or extracutaneous recurrences, and five died from malignant lymphoma 7- 84 months (median 36) after diagnosis. Histological examination showed features of marginal zone/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type lymphoma in 12 cases. Three of these had transformed to diffuse large B- cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in relapse biopsies. The remaining cases were seven primary DLBCLs and two cases tentatively classified as follicle centre cell (FCC) lymphoma. The neoplastic B cells showed similar phenotypes and genotypes in most cases (CD20+, CD79+, CD5-, CD10-, cyclin D1-, bcl-2+, bcl-x-, bax-, t(14;18)-negative). p53 protein was expressed in five cases, and four harboured mis-sense or loss-of- function mutations in the p53 gene. Deletion or promoter region hypermethylation of the p16INK4a gene was detected in two patients with DLBCL. The level of retinoblastoma protein expression and the proliferative fraction were significantly higher in DLBCL (> 50%) than in",

    "Title": "p53 intronic point mutation, aberrant splicing and telomeric associations in a case of B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia",
    "Abstract": "We report a case of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with telomeric associations and a p53 intronic point mutation. Karyotypic analysis revealed clonal and non-clonal telomeric associations, accompanied by clonal cytogenetic abnormalities and also in isolation. The p53 mutation, which occurred at the invariant base pair -2 of the splice acceptor site in intron 7 resulted in the abolition of correct splicing of exon 7 to exon 8. Multiple aberrant splice products were characterized, all of which differed from wildtype in the DNA binding domain. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated that the clone retained two copies of the p53 gene and wild-type p53 transcript was detected on cloning of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) product, indicating that one wild-type allele remained. However, a plasmid clone with correct splicing at the exon 7/8 boundary, but with a 21 bp deletion in exon 8, was also found at low frequency. This finding indicates clonal evolution, resulting in complete loss of wild-type p53. The intronic point mutation was not present in DNA extracted from cervical tissue indicating that it was a leukaemic phenomenon. This is the first case of an intronic point mutation to be reported in CLL. This mutation led to chaotic p53 expression and, interestingly, occurred in a case showing telomeric associations, a rare phenomenon in B-CLL",

    "Title": "BCL-1 rearrangements and p53 mutations in atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia with t(11;14)(q13;q32)",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The translocation t(11;14) (q13;q32), typically described in mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), has also been found in some cases of non-MCL lymphoproliferative disorders, such as splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL), multiple myeloma (MM), prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), typical and atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL and aCLL). In order to define better the genetic features of aCLL with t(11;14), which could represent a distinct disease subset, we looked for genetic lesions in the BCL-1 locus and in BCL-2, BCL-6, c- myc and p53 genes. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated a panel of B- lymphoproliferative disorders with translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) including nine aCLL, six MCL and one MM. Southern and Northern blot analysis was used to investigate DNA structure and RNA expression; SSCP and direct sequencing were used to detect and characterize p53 point mutations; cytofluorimetric analysis was used to quantify p53 protein. RESULTS: Alterations of BCL-2, BCL-6 and c-myc were not detected. Conversely, BCL-1 rearrangements were present in 4 out of 7 aCLL and in 2 out of 4 MCL. A high incidence of p53 gene alterations was found, almost equivalent in aCLL and MCL. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the occurrence of BCL-1 locus lesions in aCLL selected for t(11;14) is as high as in MCL. Interestingly, rearrangements in the mTC1 (minor translocation cluster 1) were only found in aCLL. Therefore, the two B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders share similar molecular rearrangements and the t(11;14) identifies a subset of B-CLL sharing molecular features with MCL and characterized by aggressive clinical evolution",

    "Title": "p53 gene status and expression of p53, mdm2, and p21Waf1/Cip1 proteins in colorectal cancer",
    "Abstract": "Abrogation of the normal p53 pathway is the most common molecular alteration in human cancer. p53 Gene status can be potentially assessed through the expression of proteins known to be activated by the wild- type p53 (wt p53) system, such as mdm2 and p21Waf1/Cip1. In this study, the frequency of mdm2, p21Waf1/Cip1, and p53 protein expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 88 colorectal carcinomas (CRCs). The relationship between these expressions and p53 status was examined. p53 status and the immunophenotypes characterizing these tumors were correlated with standard prognostic variables. Mutation of p53 was detected using single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing. Concordance between p53 gene status and p53 immunoreactivity was seen in 62 of 88 (70.45%) carcinomas. Mdm2 expression was found in 22 of 45 (48.88%) and 5 of 43 (11.62%) of the tumors with wt p53 and mutated p53 (P<0.0001), respectively. Predominantly, higher p21Waf1/Cip1 expression was associated with wt p53 (P<0.001). All wt p53 cases that expressed mdm2 also expressed p21Waf1/Cip1. These results suggest that there is a subgroup of CRCs in which p53 is functionally active, inducing transcription of mdm2 and Waf1/Cip1. Their combined evaluation may provide important clues for planning adjuvant systemic therapy and gene therapy based on the restitution of p53 function. However, no significant association was found between the immunophenotypes and the standard prognostic variables investigated",

    "Abstract": "We investigated a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma of a 61-year-old woman with an osteosarcomatous high-grade component for p53 alteration. The low-grade cartilaginous and the high-grade osteosarcomatous components of the tumor were macrodissected and evaluated separately by immunohistochemistry and molecular biology. We used PCR-SSCP analysis and direct sequencing to screen exons 4-8 for p53 mutations. The p53 intron 1-polymorphism was investigated for loss of heterozygosity. A functionally relevant p53 missense mutation in codon 193 of exon 6 (A- to-T transversion) with loss of wild-type allele was detected only in the dedifferentiated component. Using the monoclonal antibody DO-1, immunohistochemistry failed to show p53 overexpression. This evidence of p53 mutation may be regarded as at least a co-factor that 'switched' the preexisting low-grade conventional chondrosarcoma to a highly malignant dedifferentiated tumor",

    "Abstract": "p53 gene mutations are a common genetic alteration in human cancer and codon 72/exon 4 polymorphism of the p53 gene has been implicated in cancer risk. Therefore in this study the p53 gene status of 32 shock- frozen tumor specimens from larynx carcinomas was analyzed by PCR and sequencing of exon 4 through 9. Four mutations (12.5%) in exon 5, 7, 8 and 9 were detected in the carcinoma specimen. Analysis of codon 72 revealed in eight cases a homozygosity for proline (CCC) and in 24 cases heterozygosity or homozygosity for arginine (CGC). The group with the proline/proline genotype had a median age 10.3 years lower than the remaining patients and included the only two non-smokers. Firstly, these results confirm the p53 mutational status of laryngeal cancer without any clinical correlation and secondly may suggest an oncogenic potential for the proline/proline genotype of codon 72 for laryngeal cancer as has already been assumed for lung cancer",

    "Title": "Genetic alternations of p73 are infrequent but may occur in early stage hepatocellular carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "p73, a structural homologue of the tumor suppressor gene, p53, has recently been identified and mapped to chromosome 1p36, where genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) often occurs in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To determine whether p73 is involved in the development of HCC and whether there is an inverse correlation between the mutations of p73 and p53, we examined 22 paired tumors/noncancerous liver tissues for allelic expression, LOH and mutation of p73 and for mutation of p53. p73 was biallelically expressed in noncancerous liver tissues and in 7 out of the 8 informative tumors. One tumor tissue expressed only a single allele. LOH of p73 was found in 2 out of the 11 (18%) informative cases. A tumor-specific five-nucleotide deletion mutation causing a reading frameshift/early truncation of p73 DNA- binding domain was found, in which case no concomitant mutation in the DNA-binding domain of p53 was identified. Nine out of the 22 cases (41%) contained tumor-specific mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53. Two of the three cases with p73 genetic alternations had a tumor size of less than 2 centimeters. These results suggest that p73 is a biallelically expressed gene in the liver and that allelic loss and mutation of p73 is infrequent and may occur early in HCC. p73 is unlikely to be the putative tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome 1p36 in HCC",

    "Title": "P53 point mutations in initial superficial bladder cancer occur only in tumors from current or recent cigarette smokers",
    "Abstract": "Sequencing of p53 exons 5-8 was carried out on 51 initial superficial bladder tumors selected on the basis of high grade and/or p53 overexpression (immunohistochemistry without antigen retrieval). Fourteen point mutations in 13 tumors and one 21 bp deletion in another tumor were identified. In addition, a germ-line mutation corresponding to a previously described polymorphism was detected in exon 6, in two tumors. Mostly G-->A transitions (10) were found. Only three occurred at CpG sites, suggesting a major role for exogenous carcinogens in bladder tumorigenesis. Immunostaining for p53 and MDM2, using antigen retrieval, was carried out on the same tumors. A correlation was found between the percentage of p53-positive cells and the presence of p53 mutations (P = 0.005). No correlation was found between overexpression of p53 and MDM2 in this selected cohort of mostly high grade tumors. The presence of p53 mutations was also analyzed as a function of the smoking habits of the patients. A significant association was found between the presence of p53 point mutations and the number of years of smoking (P = 0.043). All patients with tumors carrying missense or nonsense p53 mutations had smoked for >/=30 years and if former smokers, had stopped for </=5 years. However, no correlation was found between the presence of p53 point mutations and the number of cigarettes smoked. The deletion mutation was the only one present in a tumor from a non-smoker. The data suggest that duration of exposure to carcinogens is the most critical factor in p53 mutagenesis in bladder cancer",

    "Title": "High frequency in esophageal cancers of p53 alterations inactivating the regulation of genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis",
    "Abstract": "Somatic mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 have been frequently detected in esophagal cancers, but their biological significance remains to be established. The tumor suppressor activity of p53 results in part from its ability to transactivate genes involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis, such as p21, bax and PIG3, and some p53 mutations may have a differential effect on the transactivation of these target genes. We developed yeast strains in which the activation by wild-type p53 of reporter plasmids containing p53 binding sites present within these target genes induces a change in the color of the colonies (red/white). Using these strains, we analyzed 56 esophageal cancers from patients residing in Normandy, France, a high incidence geographic area. Forty-seven tumors (84%), scored as mutant with the p21, bax and PIG3 reporter strains and in most of the cases (76%), the percentage of red colonies suggested that both p53 alleles were inactivated. Sequencing analysis allowed the identification of a p53 mutation in each positive sample, and the spectrum of mutations was in agreement with the etiological role of tobacco and alcohol. These results confirm the high frequency of biallelic p53 mutations in esophageal carcinoma and strongly suggest that their biological consequence is the complete alteration of the transactivation of genes involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis, which indicates that p53 alteration is a key event in esophagus carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Molecular alterations of p73 in human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas: loss of heterozygosity occurs frequently; loss of imprinting and elevation of p73 expression may be related to defective p53",
    "Abstract": "p73 is structurally and functionally related to p53 and is possibly a tumor suppressor gene. Using 15 surgically resected frozen esophageal specimens containing both squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) and neighboring normal epithelia, we studied p73 gene alterations and mRNA expression. Loss of heterozygosity of the p73 loci was found in nine of 14 informative cases (64%). A polymorphism at codon 173 (Thr) of p73 was identified (eight samples had ACC and seven had ACT), but mutation was not detected in tumor samples. Nine of the 15 ESCC samples (60%) displayed significantly elevated expression of p73 over the neighboring normal epithelium; of these nine samples, four displayed loss of imprinting (LOI) and one switched the expressed allele. Hypermethylation of exon 1 of the p73 gene was not detected, using the bisulfite modification method, in normal or tumor samples. Twelve of the 15 (80%) ESCC samples contained p53 defects, including missense mutation, non-frameshift small deletion or insertion, non-detectable transcripts and protein accumulation. The ESCC samples with p53 defects were significantly correlated with those which had elevated expression of p73 (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.05). The results suggest that increased expression of p73, including that by LOI, could be a partial compensatory mechanism for defective p53",

    "Title": "Prognostic value of p53 gene mutations and the product expression in de novo acute myeloid leukemia",
    "Abstract": "In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), p53 mutations are reportedly infrequent but associated with a poor prognosis. The majority of mutations are missense mutations, which generally lead to accumulation of nuclear p53 protein. However, the prognostic significance of the accumulation remains unknown in AML. In this study, we compared the prognostic value of p53 mutations versus accumulation of the product. p53 mutations were found in 9 (4.5%) of 200 patients with de novo AML. The p53 mutation detectable (mutation+) group had a worse prognosis (p = 0.0009) than the mutation not detectable (mutation-) group. Multivariate analysis showed that the p53 mutation was an independent factor (p = 0.005) for short overall survival as well as 60 yr or older (p = 0.001) and unfavorable karyotypes (p = 0.001). In 79 of the 200 patients, the expression of p53 was studied by immunocytochemistry (ICC) using anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (DO-7). All samples carrying missense mutations (N = 6) were positive for ICC in over 15% of nuclei of each sample, chosen as the optimized cutoff value of p53 accumulation. Accumulation was thus found in 14 of the 79 patients. However, there was no prognostic difference according to the accumulation, because the mutation-/accumulation+ group (N = 8) tended to have a good prognosis. These findings indicate that molecular detection of p53 mutations yields better prognostic information than ICC. In a subset of AML, p53 protein might be accumulated without mutation presumably due to upstream signals of p53",

    "Title": "Pilocytic astrocytomas do not show most of the genetic changes commonly seen in diffuse astrocytomas",
    "Abstract": "AIMS: While it is well known that pilocytic astrocytomas are clinically distinct from diffuse astrocytomas, few comprehensive studies have focused on their genetic differences. The aim of this study was to examine pilocytic astrocytomas for genetic alterations that are commonly seen in diffuse astrocytomas. METHODS AND RESULTS: By using molecular genetic and immunohistochemical techniques, we evaluated p16, p53, CDK4 and PTEN genes in 29 pilocytic astrocytomas. Mutation screening of p53 and PTEN was performed by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by direct sequencing. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of p53, p16 and 10q23-25 loci was performed with microsatellite markers and genomic microsatellite instability (MSI) was also screened. Protein expression of p16, p53, CDK4 and PTEN was examined by immunohistochemistry. Five tumours were found to have single genetic alterations, which included a p53 mutation, a PTEN mutation, MSI at a single microsatellite marker of the p16 locus, and one single LOH at each p16 and 10q23 loci. Protein expressions of p16, CDK4 and PTEN were detected in 73%, 61% and 38% of tumours, respectively. Significantly and in sharp contrast to diffuse astrocytomas, no pilocytic astrocytoma in our series stained for p53 protein. CONCLUSION: Pilocytic astrocytomas have neither MSI phenotype nor recurrent alterations of the p53 and p116 genes. However, altered expression of PTEN may be important in the genesis of pilocytic astrocytomas. We conclude that pilocytic astrocytomas are genetically distinct from diffuse astrocytomas. Lack of p53 mutation/immunostaining may serve as a diagnostic adjunct for differentiating pilocytic astrocytomas from diffuse astrocytomas in small neurosurgical biopsies",

    "Title": "Genetic changes in sweat gland carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "The molecular pathogenesis of malignant appendageal tumors is poorly understood. Immunohistochemical staining, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and sequencing analyses were performed in a mixed group of 21 sweat gland carcinomas. LOH was mostly confined to the chromosome arm 17p. None of the remaining 17 tumors showed LOH at any loci. Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein was observed in 3 tumors, all of which also showed LOH of 17p. One eccrine gland adenocarcinoma showed allelic loss of 17p and a Cys 176 Arg mutation in the p53 gene. The other three tumors that showed LOH of 17p, however, had wild-type p53 genes. A clear transition from benign eccrine poroma to porocarcinoma that was associated with p53 protein stabilization and allelic loss was observed in one tumor. One eccrine porocarcinoma/undifferentiated adnexal carcinoma showed prominent microsatellite instability, probably reflecting an underlying defect in DNA mismatch repair. Overexpression of erbB-2 was observed in three tumors. The low frequencies of LOH and p53 alterations in sweat gland carcinomas contrasted with the multiple genetic defects normally observed in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, and may be partly explained by the relative protection of cutaneous appendages from ultraviolet light and other environmental mutagens",

    "Title": "TP53 mutation and p53 overexpression for prediction of response to neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer patients",
    "Abstract": "The value of p53 to predict the cytotoxic effect of two commonly used chemotherapy regimens was assessed in patients with advanced breast cancer. Response to a DNA-damaging combination therapy [fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide (FEC] considered to induce p53-dependent apoptosis was compared with a microtubule stabilizing therapy (paclitaxel) expected to be independent of p53 function. The p53 status of the patients' breast tumors was assessed using both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and direct sequencing of the entire p53 gene. p53 findings were correlated with treatment response, and linkage between p53 function and cellular response was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assay. In a series of 67 breast tumors, 19% had TP53 gene mutations, 40% had a positive p53 IHC, and 12% had both. In the FEC group, treatment failure was related to both the presence of TP53 gene mutations (P = 0.0029) and a positive IHC (P < 0.0001). Apoptosis was almost exclusively found in tumors having normal p53 in both parameters (P < 0.0001). In the paclitaxel group, treatment response was neither related to apoptosis nor to normal p53. Combination of sequencing and IHC results revealed a significant association between abnormal p53 and response to paclitaxel (P = 0.011). We found TP53 mutations, as well as p53 protein overexpression, to be associated with response to chemotherapy. Whereas clinical response to FEC was found to be dependent on normal p53, the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel was related to defective p53. The efficiency of paclitaxel during mitosis might be supported by lack of G1 arrest due to p53 deficiency. Therefore, patients with p53-deficient tumors may benefit from paclitaxel",

    "Title": "Genomic aberrations in human hepatocellular carcinomas of differing etiologies",
    "Abstract": "We sought to assess whether genetic abnormalities in hepatocellular carcinoma differed in geographic locations associated with different risk factors. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was applied to the genome-wide chromosomal analysis in 83 tumor samples from four different geographic origins. Samples were obtained from regions that differed in aflatoxin exposure: China (Hong Kong with low aflatoxin exposure and Shanghai with moderate aflatoxin exposure), Japan, and the United States (negligible aflatoxin exposure). Cases from Hong Kong and Shanghai were all hepatitis B virus (HBV) related, those from Japan were hepatitis C virus related, and those from the United States were HBV negative. In parallel, the mutational pattern of the whole p53 gene (exons 1-11) was also investigated in these cases. CGH revealed a complex pattern of chromosomal gains and losses, with the commonest aberration in each geographic location being chromosome 1q copy number gain (38-60%). Shanghai cases displayed the highest number of total aberrations per sample, with significant copy losses on 4q (75%), 8p (70%), and 16q (65%). Hepatitis C virus-related samples from Japan had a characteristically high incidence of 11q13 gain. p53 mutation(s) was detected in 23% of Hong Kong cases, 40% of Shanghai, 31% of Japan, but only 6% of the United States cases. The 'aflatoxin-associated' codon 249 mutation was, however, identified only in samples from China (13% Hong Kong and 20% Shanghai). This finding, together with the highly aberrant pattern of genetic changes detected in the Shanghai series, is suggestive of the genotoxic effects of aflatoxin being more broadly based. It is also likely that there is a synergistic effect of HBV infection and high aflatoxin exposure in promoting hepatocellular carcinoma development. It appears from our CGH study that individual risk factors are indeed associated with distinct genetic aberrations, although changes in 1q gain appear common to all",

Exons 5-8 of the p53 gene were examined for mutations by the PCR, followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. For cases with the same LOH pattern, we calculated a clonality index, the probability of the given LOH pattern when these tumors were hypothesized to be independent in origin. Eleven of 14 cases (79%) were thus diagnosed as having pulmonary metastasis and only one case as having genuinely multicentric lung cancers. Two cases presented difficulty in diagnosis. In several cases, the LOH patterns conflicted with p53 mutation patterns, suggesting that clonal evolution is directly affected by certain genetic changes. The combination of p53 with LOH helped increase both the sensitivity and specificity of the assay",

    "Title": "Functional evaluation of p53 and PTEN gene mutations in gliomas",
    "Abstract": "We screened mutations of two major tumor suppressor genes, p53 and PTEN, in 66 human brain tumors using a yeast-based functional assay and cDNA-based direct sequencing, respectively. The frequency of p53 mutations was 28.8% (19 of 66) and was higher in anaplastic astrocytoma (9 of 14, 64.3%,) than in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 7 of 27, 25.9%,), supporting previous speculation that there are at least two genetic pathways leading to GBM, a de novo pathway without p53 mutation and a 'progressive' pathway with p53 mutation. PTEN mutation was observed in 8 of 64 tumors (12.5%), mainly GBMs (7 of 26, 26.9%), both with and without p53 mutation. These results suggest that mutation of the PTEN gene is a later event than that of the p53 gene in glioma progression and is associated with both the genetic pathways. All of the detected PTEN missense mutations and an in-frame small deletion inactivated PTEN phosphoinositide phosphatase activity in vitro. Because the tumors containing PTEN mutations also showed loss of heterozygosity in the chromosome 10q23 region flanking the PTEN gene, our data clearly indicate that inactivation of both PTEN alleles occurs in a subset of high-grade gliomas, therefore confirming the previous idea that PTEN acts as a tumor suppressor gene",

    "Title": "Heterogeneity in the clinical phenotype of TP53 mutations in breast cancer patients",
    "Abstract": "TP53 mutation is a strong independent marker for survival in breast cancer with some heterogeneity in the clinical phenotype of various types of mutations. Based on 315 patients with breast carcinoma, we suggest a new model for the differentiation of TP53 mutations. Although TP53 mutation in general was associated with aggressive tumor/patient characteristics, missense mutations outside any conserved or structural domain did not affect the clinical outcome (risk of disseminated disease and death). In contrast, patients with missense mutations affecting amino acids directly involved in DNA or zinc binding displayed a very aggressive clinical phenotype. Null mutations (including missense mutations disrupting the tetramerization domain) and the remaining missense mutations displayed an intermediate aggressive clinical phenotype. When patients with primary early breast cancer were divided into three groups (wild-type together with missense mutations outside structural/conserved domains, null mutations and missense mutations with intermediate clinical phenotype, and very aggressive missense mutations), disease-specific survival rates were 89%, 58%, and 35% (5-year actuarial values, P < 0.0001), respectively. In a Cox proportional hazards analysis, separation of TP53 mutations according to these criteria eliminated the prognostic importance of all investigated classical factors except nodal status",

    "Title": "Abnormal expression of the ATM and TP53 genes in sporadic breast carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "The ataxia telangiectasia gene (ATM) has been implicated as a risk factor in the development of sporadic breast carcinomas. ATM protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 17 breast carcinomas with two monoclonal antibodies whose immunohistochemical use was first validated by comparing the immunoreactivity observed in spleen samples from ataxia telangiectasia and trauma patients. In normal breast ducts, ATM showed nuclear expression in the epithelial but not in the myoepithelial cells. In contrast, this nuclear expression was absent or low in the epithelial cancer cells in 10 of 17 (59%) of the tumors studied. Allelic imbalance in the ATM gene was found in three of seven tumors examined. Two of these showed reduced ATM protein expression, but this did not correlate with the presence of ATM mutations in the tumor DNA detected by restriction endonuclease fingerprinting screening. These results suggest that the reduced ATM protein expression could be attributable, in certain tumors, to deletions or rearrangements within or close to the ATM gene. Positive p53 immunostaining was found in 10 tumors, with TP53 mutations detected in 8. Three tumors had both low ATM expression and mutated TP53. Our results indicate that in the majority (15 of 17) of the sporadic breast carcinomas examined, not only is the functionality of the ATM-p53- mediated DNA damage response compromised, but also other signaling pathways activated by these two multifunctional proteins are likely to be impaired, which could be a contributing factor to tumor development and progression",

    "Title": "P53 mutations in primary and metastatic tumors and circulating tumor cells from colorectal carcinoma patients",
    "Abstract": "Circulating tumor cells could provide a relatively noninvasive and repeatable source of information about tumor cell genotype that might influence treatment and estimation of prognosis. We developed a technique for identifying p53 mutations in tumor cells isolated from the peripheral venous blood of colorectal cancer patients and compared the prevalence and position of these mutations with multiple solid tumor samples from the same patient. We used immunomagnetic beads to isolate tumor cells, reverse transcriptase-nested polymerase chain amplification of the coding region between exons 4 and 9 within the p53 gene, and automated gene sequencing. Nineteen p53 mutations were detected in solid tumor samples from 19 of 41 colorectal carcinoma patients. An identical p53 mutation was invariably present in all samples from primary and metastatic colorectal tumor biopsies within the same patient. p53 mutations were detected in peripheral blood from 8 of these 19 patients with p53-mutated solid tumors. Where identified, the pattern of mutation in peripheral blood samples was invariably the same as in matching solid tumor samples. A single colorectal carcinoma biopsy provided reliable p53 gene mutational information in colorectal carcinoma. Detection of this p53 mutation in tumor cells from peripheral blood was achieved with an approach based on cell selection for epithelial characteristics, reverse transcription-PCR, and gene sequencing",

    "Title": "Detection of minimal residual cancer to investigate why oral tumors recur despite seemingly adequate treatment",
    "Abstract": "Improvements in surgery and radiotherapy techniques have led to only a modest increase in the 5-year survival rate for patients with head and neck cancer. This is because the pattern of clinical disease is changing, such that locoregional recurrence now accounts for fewer treatment failures, but more patients develop a second primary cancer or distant metastatic disease. In this study, we have used the p53 phage plaque assay, immunocytochemistry, and mutational analysis to assess the contribution of minimal residual cancer and genetic aberrations in clinically normal upper aerodigestive tract mucosa to treatment failure. Eighteen consecutive patients with oral tumors, with conventional clear margins, have been followed for a minimum of 36 months. Molecular assessment identified tumor-positive surgical margins for 6 of 11 assessable patients and additional tumor-positive lymph nodes for three cases. Disseminated malignant cells were detected in the hematopoietic cell compartment for six cases, and one patient had molecular evidence of field cancerization. Locoregional recurrence developed in five patients with tumors harboring a p53 gene mutation; four of these were associated with tumor-positive surgical margins, and one was associated with molecular evidence of field cancerization. Radiotherapy to the primary site did not prevent development of local recurrence when the residual tumor harbored a p53 gene mutation. Three of six cases with a tumor-positive bone marrow aspirate developed distant metastases. These findings reveal that molecular and immunocytochemical detection of minimal residual cancer and field cancerization can help identify patients who may develop locoregional or distant recurrence and justify further studies to evaluate the contribution of these remaining malignant cells to treatment failure",

    "Title": "Prognostic significance of mutations to different structural and functional regions of the p53 gene in breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "Alteration to the p53 tumor suppressor gene is associated with more aggressive disease in breast cancer, as evidenced by the shortened survival of patients with mutation. Data obtained from in vitro experiments suggest that mutations to different structural and functional domains of p53 may give rise to different effects on its biological activities, notably transactivational and apoptotic properties. We evaluated the prognostic significance of various types of p53 mutation in a series of 178 tumors identified by PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism screening as containing a mutant gene. Mutations within exon 4 were associated with particularly poor prognosis, possibly relating to the importance of this region in apoptosis.  Mutations that caused denaturation of the protein structure were also associated with poor survival, again perhaps because of effects on apoptosis.  In contrast, patients with mutations in the DNA contact region showed similar survival to that of patients wit normal p53, suggesting a less important role for p53-mediated transactivation in determining tumor aggressiveness. Other mutation groups associated with poor prognosis were single-base substitutions and transversion mutations.  Mutations in exon 6, exon 7, or the 'hotspot' codons (175, 245, 248, 273) were associated with only a small reduction in patient survival compared with normal p53.  These results allow some insight to be gained into the functional importance of various p53 domains in terms of their influence on overall patient survival. Further work is required to determine whether these domains are also important in influencing the response of breast tumors to adjuvant therapies.",

    "Title": "Drug-induced apoptosis in lung cnacer cells is not mediated by the Fas/FasL (CD95/APO1) signaling pathway",
    "Abstract": "Anticancer drugs exert at least part of their cytotoxic effect by triggering apoptosis. We previously identified chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells and suggested a role for p53 alternative or complementary pathways in this process. Recently, a role for the Fas/FasL (CD95/Apo1) signaling system in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was proposed in some cell types. In the present work, the involvement of the Fas/FasL system in drug-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells was investigated upon exposure to four cytotoxic drugs (cisplatin, gemcitabine, topotecan, and paclitaxel). We assessed the expression of Fas and FasL and the function of the Fas pathway in six lung cancer cell lines (H460, H322, GLC4, GLC4/ADR, H187, and N417). All lung cancer cell lines expressed Fas and FasL at RNA and protein levels, and apoptosis could be induced in four of six cell lines upon exposure to the Fas agonistic monoclonal antibody (mAb) CLB-CD95/15. Nevertheless, after drug exposure, no significant FasL up-regulation was observed, whereas the Fas expression was increased in the wild-type p53 cell line H460, but not in the other lines, proved to be mutant p53 by direct gene sequencing. Moreover, no correlation was observed in lung cancer cell lines between sensitivity to drugs and to a Fas agonistic mAb, and preincubation of cells with either the Fas-antagonistic mAb CLB-CD95/2 or a FasL-neutralizing mAb did not protect from drug-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these observations strongly argue against a role of the Fas/FasL signaling pathway in drug-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. Interestingly, caspase-8 activation was observed upon drug exposure, independently from Fas/FasL signaling",

    "Abstract": "Evidence has accumulated indicating that HLA-A2-restricted CTLs specific for human wild-type sequence p53 epitopes lyse tumor cells expressing mutant p53. To explore the possibility that wild-type sequence p53 peptides could also be used in vaccines for patients expressing HLA-A24 antigen, another frequent HLA class I allele, we investigated the induction of HLA-A24-restricted p53-specific CTLs from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of normal donors. Of six p53-derived peptides possessing an HLA-A24 binding motif, the p53 peptide 125-134 (p53(125-134)) was found to have a high binding capacity and induced peptide-specific CTLs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, using peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells and subsequent cultivation with cytokines interleukin 2 and interleukin 7. Bulk CTL populations lysed peptide-pulsed HLA-A24+ targets as well as HLA-A24+ squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) cell lines. However, IFN-gamma pretreatment of HLA-A24+ SCCHN cell lines was necessary for lysis, suggesting that a ligand density higher than that normally expressed by tumor cells is required for these CTLs to mediate lysis. Moreover, a cloned CTL, designated TH#99, isolated from the bulk population by limiting dilution, lysed HLA-A24+ SCCHN targets more efficiently than the bulk CTL population. Lysis was inhibited by anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibody but not by anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody. These results indicate that HLA-A24-restricted CTLs recognizing the wild-type sequence p53(125-134) can be generated using autologous dendritic cells from precursors present in peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from normal HLA-A24+ donors. This finding suggests that vaccine strategies targeting wild-type sequence p53 epitopes can be extended to a wider range of cancer patients",

    "Abstract": "Papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum (PSCP) is a primary neoplasm of peritoneal origin, and is histologically difficult to differentiate from papillary serous carcinoma of the ovary (PSCO). PSCP is frequently accompanied by many peritoneal tumors, and has been managed as a disseminated disease. In previous reports, however, the clonality of the tumors has not been fully discussed. Recently, the significant roles of the p53 and BRCA1 genes in PSCP have been reported. In this study, we investigated immunohistochemical staining for p53 proteins, and investigated p53 gene mutations, using DNA sequencing analysis, to clarify the clonality of PSCP tumors. Immunohistochemically, all the tumor samples demonstrated nuclear overexpression of p53 proteins, and the DNA sequencing analysis of the p53 gene showed diverse point mutations at codons 167 and 192 in two of four anatomically different tumors. In conclusion, the possibility of polyclonality of PSCP tumors is suggested",

    "Abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has potent angiogenic activity and has been identified in a wide variety of malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The tumour- suppressor gene p53 has been thought to regulate VEGF. Cryostat sections of 33 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) were immunostained for VEGF using a standard streptavidin-biotin complex procedure. To evaluate angiogenesis, microvascular density was counted by staining endothelial cells immunohistochemically using anti-vWF monoclonal antibody. The p53 gene status was analysed using a PCR-SSCP analysis and direct sequencing. VEGF positive staining was detected in 18 (55%) out of 33 tumours. VEGF immunoreactivity did not correlate with the main clinicopathological characteristics of the patients (localization, T-stage, N-status, histological grading). Statistical analysis gave a clear correlation between the tumour vascularity and the VEGF protein expression (p = 0.0036). VEGF negative tumours showed a lower mean number of microvessels per microscopic field (60.3 +/- 15.5) than VEGF positive tumours (79.6 +/- 22.9). P53 mutations were identified in 12 (36.4%) of 33 tumours. The association of p53 mutations and VEGF expression level was significant (0.027). The higher microvessel density in VEGF positive tumours supports the importance of VEGF for tumour angiogenesis in HNSCC. Our results support the hypothesis of a p53 regulation on the angiogenic process through a VEGF up-regulation",

    "Abstract": "The fine-needle aspiration (FNA) technique is a widely used method for diagnostic assessment of breast diseases. In the current study we investigated the feasibility of sampling material for genetic studies from the same FNA samples as would be used for breast cytology. After making smears for cytological examination, the needle was rinsed into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. The material gained was sufficient for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based study. As the FNA samples reflect a broad range of breast diseases, it is possible to study genetic changes at various stages of the neoplastic process. We looked for mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene in 198 FNA needle rinses, 42 from carcinomas and 156 from cytologically benign lesions. In the malignant samples, 22% carried mutations in the p53 gene. We also looked for p53 mutations in matching tissue sections from tumors and found the FNA needle rinses to represent the tumor well. In addition, three mutations in cytologically benign lesions were found, but none of these 3 patients were diagnosed with malignant tumors in the time frame of the study. The clinical significance of p53 mutations in benign breast tissue remains to be determined",

    "Title": "TP53 mutations and mdm2 protein overexpression in cholangiocarcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Tumor suppressor protein p53 is a positive regulator of MDM2 gene expression and the mdm2 protein can bind to p53, preventing the transactivation of p53 responsive genes, thus mimicking TP53 mutation. The authors looked for alterations that could affect, directly and indirectly, p53 function in 13 patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Molecular analysis by single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing revealed that TP53 gene mutations occurred in only 2 of 13 cholangiocarcinomas. High levels of mdm2 protein were found, by immunohistochemical staining, in 61% of the cholangiocarcinomas and in almost all specimens (70%) displaying stabilized p53 protein in the absence and in the presence of TP53 mutations. The finding of co-overexpressed mdm2 and p53 proteins in cholangiocarcinomas indicates that they can upregulate the expression of mdm2 protein to a level sufficient for binding and accumulating p53 in a presumably inactive complexed form. The presence of TP53 mutations or upregulation of MDM2 gene expression in 9 of the 13 cholangiocarcinomas strongly supports that the impairment of the p53 pathway is an important and specific step in cholangiocarcinoma pathogenesis. At variance with other authors, no alteration of p16ink4/CDKN2 gene was observed in all 13 cholangiocarcinomas",

The primary endpoint for PDT has been resolution of dysplasia. We studied the effect of PDT at the genetic level. METHODS: Archival material from 3 patients who had initial improvement in dysplasia after PDT but occurrence of high-grade dysplasia during follow-up was used. Biopsy specimens were analyzed for increased proliferation, aneuploidy, p53 protein overexpression, p53 mutations, and p16 promoter hypermethylation. RESULTS: Patients developed high- grade dysplasia 16, 28, and 37 months after PDT. In all cases, one or more genetic markers were positive after PDT treatment, whereas histology was downstaged consistently after therapy. Increasing genetic abnormalities were noted by the end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic abnormalities may persist after PDT despite phenotypical improvement of dysplasia. These patients may progress to high-grade dysplasia or develop adenocarcinoma. Histologic improvement in dysplasia is an inadequate endpoint for PDT in patients with Barrett's esophagus",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Our long-term goal was to evaluate the role of p53 in the prognosis of gastric cancer. We previously showed a discrepancy between p53 expression and the presence of mutations when only exons 5- 9 were examined. We then evaluated exon 4. METHODS: DNA was sequenced from 217 gastric cancers to detect exon 4 alterations. Codon 72 was examined by restriction enzyme digestion. RESULTS: Mutations were present in 3.2% of tumors. In addition, 2 polymorphic sites were found at codons 36 and 72. Polymorphisms at codon 36 were only found in 2 patients. In contrast, the codon 72 polymorphism was very frequent. The genotype frequency was arg/arg (54%), arg/pro (33%), and pro/pro (14%). The genotype of the polymorphic site varied with race (P = 0.001): 64% of whites had the arg/arg genotype, compared with 24% of blacks. The difference in genotype by site, sex, or histological tumor type was not statistically significant (P = 0.067). CONCLUSIONS: There are several exon 4 alterations in gastric cancers. These include the rare mutations and the very rare codon 36 polymorphism. The most common change is the codon 72 polymorphism, the genotype of which differs significantly with race. The more common arg/arg genotype in whites may explain why whites are more prone to develop cardiac cancer, whereas the more common proline allele in blacks may explain why they are more prone to develop antral cancers. Further studies are required to determine whether the codon 72 polymorphism affects patient predisposition to gastric cancer",

    "Abstract": "Patho-epidemiological studies showed that thyroid lymphoma (TL) arises in inflammatory lesions of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLTH). Replication error (RER) is found in inflammatory lesions and associated cancer, suggesting that chronic inflammation could be a risk factor for neoplastic development through causing RER. To clarify whether RER is involved in the pathogenesis of TL, we examined the microsatellite instability (MSI) in 9 cases with CLTH and 19 with TL, including 10 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL), 4 follicle center cell lymphoma, 3 marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of extranodal (MALT) type, and 2 lymphoplasmacytic type. Sixteen distinct microsatellite repeats were analyzed. Mutations of p53 and k-ras genes were also examined. When alterations at 2 or more microsatellite loci were judged as positive, only 5 DLBL cases exhibited MSI. The frequency of MSI in DLBL was significantly higher than that in other types of TL and CLTH (P < 0.05). Four of 19 cases (21.1%) showed point mutation of the k-ras gene. The k-ras mutations occurred in the cases with DLBL with RER, and four of five cases with RER had a k-ras mutation, indicating a close association between RER and k-ras mutation. p53 mutations were not found in the CLTH. Two of 19 TL cases showed mutations of p53 gene. There was no significant association between RER and p53 mutation. These findings indicate that genomic instability contributes to the progression of TL from low grade to high grade, but not to the development of low grade lymphoma in CLTH lesions",

    "Title": "p53 status in multiple human urothelial cancers: assessment for clonality by the yeast p53 functional assay in combination with p53 immunohistochemistry",
    "Abstract": "Multifocal synchronous or metachronous tumor development is a common observation in human urothelial cancer cases. However, the underlying mechanism has remained obscure. We have employed a new tool to investigate the p53 gene status, the yeast p53 functional assay, in combination with immunohistochemistry in a total of 50 tumor samples from 32 cases with urothelial cancers, including 8 with multiple synchronous tumor development and 2 demonstrating metachronous tumors. p53 mutations were found in 13 cases (9 with missense mutations, 3 with deletion, 1 with splicing mutation) by the yeast p53 functional assay. p53 protein overexpression was seen in all 9 cases with missense mutations, but in only one of the 4 cases with nonsense mutations. Two tumors without p53 mutation also showed positive p53 immunoreactivity. Overall, p53 abnormalities including mutations and/or protein overexpression were found in 15 (47%) cases. p53 abnormalities were significantly more frequent in non-papillary and in high grade tumors. Loss of the wild type allele in addition to a p53 mutation was suggested in 8 of the 15 (53%) cases. All 4 cases with mutations in multiple synchronous tumors had identical p53 mutations in the separate urothelial cancers, strongly suggestive of monoclonality. The one case with multiple metachronous tumors, in contrast, was characterized by variation in the p53 status, indicative of different clonal origins. In conclusion, combined assessment for p53 status as used here (yeast p53 functional assay plus immunohistochemistry) may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of urothelial carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Mutations in zinc-binding domains of p53 as a prognostic marker of esophageal-cancer patients",
    "Abstract": "Some investigators have suggested that mutations of the p53 gene may be molecular markers for poor prognosis of cancer patients, although others have reported conflicting results. We examined esophageal cancers from 138 patients to investigate whether mutational status of p53 could be correlated either with prognosis or with response to chemotherapy or radiation. We detected p53 mutations in the tumors of 78 (56.5%) patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that these 78 patients tended to have shorter survival times and greater resistance to either form of therapy than patients whose tumors carried two wild- type p53 alleles. The difference became more evident when we focused on mutations in zinc-binding domains of p53 (L2 and L3); the prognosis was significantly poorer among the 29 patients with tumors in this category than among patients whose tumors had no p53 mutations, or p53 mutations outside L2 or L3 (P=0.0060). Moreover, those tumors as a group were more resistant to chemotherapy or radiation than the others (P=0.0105). Our results underscore the importance of the zinc-binding domains of p53 with respect to clinical prognosis for patients with esophageal carcinomas",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and concurrent carcinoma: analysis of laser capture microdissected specimens from non- transition and transition zones",
    "Abstract": "Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is characterized by intraluminal proliferation of epithelial cells and is divided into high- grade (HGPIN) and low-grade (LGPIN) lesions. HGPIN is regarded as the most likely precursor of prostatic cancer (PCA). Microdissected DNA selectively extracted from paraffin-embedded sections of 27 cases with PCA were analyzed for p53 mutation in exons 5 - 8 by single-strand conformation polymorphism of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments (PCR-SSCP) followed by direct sequencing. These patients received total prostatectomy (27 cases). After a review of histologic sections, DNA was extracted from 193 locations; 111 lesions from 27 cases with HGPIN (75 lesions from non-transition zone and 36 from transition zone), 55 lesions from 27 cases with PCA (30 lesions from non-transition zone and 25 from transition zone), and 27 from 27 benign glands. Analysis revealed 27 mutations of the p53 gene in 24 lesions from 12 cases. Benign glands adjoining PIN and / or PCA had no mutations. All mutations were point mutations: 17 missense, 7 silent, and 2 nonsense. Mutations were detected in 6 cases (22.2%) or 13 of 111 lesions (11.7%) with HGPIN and 8 cases (29.6%) or 11 of 55 lesions (20.0%) with PCA. In a given case, HGPIN and PCA lesions had different p53 mutations from each other, suggesting multiclonal development of prostatic precancerous lesions. The frequency of p53 mutation of PCA was significantly higher in the non-transition zone (33.3%) than in the transition zone (4%), and higher in the stage T3 cases (30.3%) than in the stage T2 cases (4.5%, 1 of 22 lesions) (both P < 0.05). Frequency of p53 mutation of PIN in the non-transition zone (14.7%) was higher than that in the transition zone (5.6%), although the difference was not significant. The frequency rate of p53 mutation in HGPIN close to PCA ( </= 2 mm) was significantly higher (24%) than that in HGPIN lesions > 2 mm from PCA (3%). All these findings indicate that the p53 gene mutations are involved in prostatic carcinogenesis and explain why the non-transition zone is the predominant site of PCA",

    "Abstract": "In this study, to better understand the mechanism of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) carcinogenesis, alterations of the p53 gene and overexpression of MDM2 and p53 were analyzed in 38 oral SCC samples. Twelve of the 38 specimens revealed mutant-type p53. Moreover, coexpression of MDM2 and p53 was found most frequently in dysplastic lesions (P < 0.05). Expression of MDM2 and p53 was significantly increased in accordance with the histological progression of multistep carcinogenesis (P < 0.05). No significant correlation was found between the expression of MDM2 and the alteration of p53 protein or p53 gene status. MDM2 overexpression with mutant p53 was significantly associated with poorly differentiated SCCs (P < 0.05) and tumor stages III and IV of oral SCCs (P < 0.05). These results suggest that MDM2 overexpression is an early event in oral carcinogenesis through the functional inactivation of the wild-type p53, and corresponding alterations of MDM2 and p53 contribute to the oral carcinogenesis. We propose that it would be clinically more instructive to evaluate MDM2 overexpression combined with p53 gene status, compared to the evaluation of either MDM2 or p53 alteration alone",

    "Title": "Association between p53 immunostaining and cigarette smoking in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that cigarette smoking is closely associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. This study investigated the molecular targets of cigarette smoke in carcinogenesis of the esophagus. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were grouped according to daily cigarette consumption: heavy smoking group (group H) (n = 26), moderate smoking group (group M) (n = 39) and non-smoking group (group N) (n = 9). We compared p53 and retinoblastoma (RB) expression among the three groups by immunohistochemistry. In addition, fresh tumor tissues from 30 smokers with esophageal SCC were tested for p53 mutations in exons 5-8 by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Staining for the p53 product was positive in 65.4% of group H, 38.5% of group M and 44.4% of group N. The frequency of positive staining in the group H was significantly higher than in group M (p = 0.033) and in group M + group N (p = 0.034). The difference with respect to the frequency of overexpression of RB was not significant. The patterns of p53 base-pair mutations in direct sequencing study were of five types, most commonly G:C to T:A transversion (35.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that one of the molecular targets of cigarette smoke is the p53 gene. The pattern of p53 point mutations involved a wide range of base-pair changes",

The NHL was a diffuse large B-cell type in the father and a small cleaved follicular type in the son. Cytogenetic and molecular studies of the lymphoma cells revealed the rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (JH) gene in both patients, the mutation of p53 gene in the father and t(14; 18) (q32; q21) in the son. Both patients had low serum immunoglobulin levels. It is not known whether the occurrence of NHL in this family was incidental or pathogenetically related, since there was no clear common molecular abnormality between the father and the son. The pathogenetic mechanism of this familial occurrence of NHL is discussed",

    "Abstract": "TRAIL (APO-2L) is a newly identified member of the TNF family and induces apoptosis in cancer cells without affecting most non-neoplastic cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Our study focused on the expression and function of TRAIL and its receptors in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines of all major histological types. Here, we demonstrate that all RCC cell lines express TRAIL as well as the death-inducing receptors TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (Killer/DR5). Exposure to TRAIL induced apoptosis in 10 of 16 RCC cell lines. Remarkably, five of six TRAIL-resistant RCC cell lines exhibited high levels of TRAIL expression. Topotecan, a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor, induced upregulation of TRAIL-R2 as well as downregulation of TRAIL. Neutralization of TRAIL with recombinant soluble TRAIL-R1-Fc and TRAIL-R2-Fc failed to inhibit topotecan-induced apoptosis indicating that topotecan-induced cell death can occur in a TRAIL-independent fashion. However, exposure to topotecan resulted in an enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in all primarily TRAIL-resistant RCC cell lines. This synergistic effect of cotreatment with Topotecan and TRAIL may provide the basis for a new therapeutic approach to induce apoptosis in otherwise unresponsive RCC",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To further illustrate the roles of p53 gene, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 10 and 17 p in human glioma progression. METHODS: p53 mutations were scanned in 50 gliomas with various malignant grades using the polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) assay, and were confirmed by direct sequencing. LOH for chromosome 10, 17 p and amplification of the EGFR gene were also assessed using Southern blot analysis. RESULTS: p53 mutations were found in 9 of 17 high-grade astrocytomas (53%), 1 of 15 low-grade astrocytomas (7%), and the only subject of eppendymoblastoma but in none of the 10 medulloblastomas and 7 eppendymomas. The majority of gliomas (38/50) analyzed here retained both 17 p alleles. The frequency of p53 mutations was 13% in this group of tumors and increased to 50% (6/12) in tumors with one 17 p allele (P < 0.025). LOH on chromosome 10 was found in 35% (6/17) of high-grade astrocytomas, in 10% (1/10) of medulloblastomas, but in 0% of low-grade gliomas. EGFR gene amplification was found in 9 high-grade gliomas, 60% (6/9) of which also presented LOH for chromosome 10. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that p53 inactivation is a common genetic event in astrocytoma progression that may be more strongly associated with the progression of astrocytomas than with their origin. Absence of p53 mutations in 50% of the tumors with one 17 p allele suggests that a tumor suppressor gene other than p53 may be located on chromosome 17 p and involved in progression to malignancy of some gliomas. The loss of alleles on chromosome 10 and the amplification of the EGFR gene appear to be restricted to high-grade tumors, suggesting that these events may be related to tumor progression rather than initiation",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the association of p53 abnormalities (gene mutations by DNA sequencing and protein over-expression by immunostaining) with clinical data and prognosis in 74 patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). DNA analysis of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene showed 34 mutations in 74 resected primary NSCLC (45.9%). Immunohistochemical study of the p53 protein revealed that 41 of 74 (55.4%) samples had positive staining. We found strong agreement between the results of the p53 protein expression test (p53-PE) and the p53 gene mutation test (p53-M) (Cohen's kappa = 0.65, 95% CI 0.48-0.82). Joint distribution of the results (analysed using the bivariate Dale model) was mainly influenced by, histological type of tumour. A positive result for the p53-PE test significantly increased (estimated odds ratio 84.5; 95% CI 8.89-803.03) the odds of observing a positive result in the p53-M test. In the univariate analysis (log rank test), positive results in the p53-M test and the p53-PE test were significantly associated with overall survival (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). In the multivariate analysis (Cox's proportional hazard model), a positive result for the p53-M test significantly increased relative risk for overall survival (RR 9.56; 95% CI 2.62-34.87; P &lt; 0.001). When the result of the p53-M test was accounted for, a positive result for the p53-PE test did not offer any additional prognostic information due to the strong dependence of results of the tests. However, when the result of the p53-M test was removed from the model, a positive result for the p53-PE test became a significant unfavourable prognostic factor (P = 0.009). We conclude that p53 gene mutation and protein expression analyses are in a strong agreement. Joint distribution of the results depends mainly on histological type of tumour. When considered separately, both tests are unfavourable prognostic factors in NSCLC. When the result of the p53-M test is taken into account, the p53-PE test does not offer any additional prognostic information",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inactivation of the tumour suppressor gene, p53, is the commonest genetic abnormality in human cancer. The study of the type of p53 mutation in a given tumour may provide prognostic information, clues to aetiology and become useful for therapeutics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The molecular characterisation of p53 was performed by restriction analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and gene sequencing for exons 5-9. RESULTS: We report, p53 mutational analysis in exons 5-9 in 29 European patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent attempted resection. Four patients (14%) showed somatic single nucleotide substitutions with amino acid changes (146, 163, 175, 158, and 175) with one showing mutations in two different positions involving a loss of two CfoI sites. All the mutations occurred in exon 5. Three patients had a germline polymorphism (10%) with a silent substitution in codon 213 (exon 6). CONCLUSIONS: The systematic screening for p53 mutations in European patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma has shown that the type of mutation (except 175) is different and its incidence is much lower when compared to the pattern previously reported for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in East Asian patients. A probable explanation is that the presence and type of p53 mutation is dependent on geographic and environmental factors which vary in different populations",

    "Abstract": "Esophageal carcinoma frequently occurs in patients with long-standing achalasia. AIM: To examine the role of p53 alterations and PCNA in patients with megaesophagus. METHODS: Sections of four tumors, and corresponding adjacent areas, from patients with achalasia due to Chagas' disease were examined by immunohistochemistry for p53 and PCNA proteins. Furthermore, 128 biopsies from 16 advanced achalasic patients were prospectively collected and evaluated for grades of inflammation, hyperplasia, dysplasia and also for p53 and PCNA proteins. All specimens showing p53 immunoreactivity were topographically genotyped using microdissection, PCR amplification and direct sequencing of p53 exons 5-8. RESULTS: Diffuse strong immunoreactivity of p53 was observed in 2/4 tumors. In one patient, the adjacent mucosa also showed strong p53. In the adjacent mucosa, the same areas showing p53 overexpression also had PCNA positive cells. In the prospective group, 7/16 (43.7%) patients or 53/128 (41.4%) biopsies expressed p53. The grade of inflammation was significantly correlated with the presence of positive p53, in patients, p = 0.004 and in biopsies, p < 0.00001. PCNA expression was found in the basal layer of the mucosa, and increased PCNA was associated with p53 overexpression, p = 0.00018. Genotyping detected mutation in exon 6, codon 213 RG, in one patient (1/16, 6.2%). CONCLUSIONS: (1.) p53 alterations, overexpression and mutational change, are an early event in patients with achalasia; (2.) The inflammation frequently seen in these patients appears to be associated with alterations of the p53 protein; (3.) Expression of the tumor suppressor gene is increased in areas showing proliferation",

    "Abstract": "The relationship between expression of p53 protein in bladder cancer and tumor progression is known. In this paper, we attempt to study this phenomenon by molecular-genetic techniques. One hundred thirty-seven bladder tumor tissues were obtained from transurethral resection (TURB). Urine sediments were collected from 72 patients suffering from transitional cell carcinoma and tumor recurrence. These patients were followed up for at least three months. Separate polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out for exons 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the Tp53 gene. Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) was used to screen mutations in the PCR products. Sequencing from reamplified mutant and wildtype bands was excised from the TGGE. Tp53 mutation frequency is 43.1% in 137 bladder cancer specimens, but already 32.7% of Ta-tumors (16/49) were Tp53 mutated. Four of 25 patients with Tp53 wild-type tumors suffered from progression. In the group of patients with Tp53 mutated cancer, seven of 12 had a tumor progression. In 11 of 14 patients with Tp53 mutation in cancer tissue, the same mutation was also found in urine sediments. In such patients, successful tumor treatment by TURB results in loss of their Tp53 mutation in urine sediment, and tumor recurrency resulted in reappearance",

    "Title": "Association between INK4a-ARF and p53 mutations in skin carcinomas of xeroderma pigmentosum patients",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The INK4a-ARF locus encodes two tumor suppressor proteins, p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), that act through the Rb-CDK4 and p53 pathways, respectively. Data from murine models and sporadic human skin carcinomas implicate p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) in the development of skin carcinomas. We examined the frequency of INK4a-ARF, p53, and CDK4 mutations in skin carcinomas from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a rare autosomal disease that is associated with a defect in DNA repair and that predisposes patients to skin cancer. METHODS: DNA from skin cancers of 28 unrelated XP patients was screened for mutations in p53, INK4a-ARF, and CDK4 coding exons by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and automated sequencing. Data were evaluated with the use of the exact unconditional test derived from Fisher's test. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Eight of 28 XP- associated tumors had mutations in the INK4a-ARF locus. Three XP- associated tumors had multiple mutations at this locus. In all, 13 mutations in the INK4a-ARF locus were detected in XP-associated tumors, of which seven (54%) were signature UV radiation-induced mutations, i.e., tandem CC : GG-->TT : AA transitions. p53 mutations, mostly of the type induced by UV radiation, were present in 12 tumors (43%). Statistically significant positive associations were found between the frequency of mutations in p53 and in p16(INK4a) (P =.008) and between the frequency of mutations in p53 and in p14(ARF) (P<.001). No mutations were detected within the CDK4 gene. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated for the first time the occurrence of UV radiation-induced mutations in INK4a-ARF in XP-associated skin carcinomas. The simultaneous inactivation of p53 and INK4a-ARF may be linked to the genetic instability caused by XP and could be advantageous for tumor progression",

    "Abstract": "To assess the multiple steps involved in carcinogenesis we evaluated p53 gene mutation frequencies, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosomes 3p, 9p and 17p in hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, dysplasia, squamous cell carcinoma in-situ and early squamous cell carcinoma of the bronchial epithelium, using immunohistochemical, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and microsatellite analysis. Overexpression of p53 oncoprotein was observed in 31% of mild dysplasia, 50% of moderate and 67% of severe dysplasia. Mutation of the p53 gene, however, was confirmed only in 2 severe dysplasias. LOH of 3p, 9p and 17p were detected in 8% of mild and 6% of moderate dysplasias. Among other types of bronchial lesions, two columnar cell hyperplasias showed LOH of 3p and 17p, respectively. These results suggest that LOH of 3p or 9p may be a rare but early event in the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. In particular, deletion of 3p21.3 is a relatively common event in premalignancy. The results also suggest that p53 gene abnormalities occur during the following stage of carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "A comprehensive karyotypic analysis on a newly developed hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HKCI-1, by spectral karyotyping and comparative genomic hybridization",
    "Abstract": "A continuously growing human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line was established from a Chinese male, carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). This cell line, designated HKCI-1, grows as an adhering monolayer of polygonal epithelial cells that embody one or more nuclei. HKCI-1 secretes alpha-fetoprotein but shows no evidence of HBV carriage. Conventional banding analysis of the short-term cultured primary tumor and the propagated HKCI-1 revealed a chromosome modal number of near-triploidy. It was, however, impossible to derive their complete karyotype due to the complex nature of chromosomal rearrangements and many marker chromosomes of uncertain origin. Spectral karyotyping (SKY) is a newly developed molecular cytogenetic technique that allows the unprecedented discernment of chromosomal abnormalities. Spectral karyotyping analysis on HKCI-1 and the primary tumor elucidated all aberrant chromosomes and revealed complex karyograms. Recurring aberrations detected in both primary tumor and HKCI-1 included der(X)t(X;11)(q10;p10), der(1)t(1;10)(q10;?pq), der(4)t(4;16)(p10;q10), i(5p), del(5)(q13), der(7)t(7;21)(q32q10::q10), der(8)t(8;17)(q10;p10), and der(9)t(9;22)(q34;?pq). Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was employed to monitor the culture evolution in vitro. Genomic imbalances in HKCI-1 involved chromosomal losses on 4q, 5q13-qter, 8p, 9pter-q33, 10q, 11q, 13q, 16q, 17q12-qter, and 22, and low-level gains on 6pter-q22, 7p, 8q, 9q34, 10p, 11p, 12, 17pter-q11.2, 18, 19, 20, 21, and Y. High-level amplifications were also detected on 5pter-q12, 7q11.2-qter, and Xq. The corresponding CGH finding on the primary tumor indicated similar imbalances. TP53 mutational analysis showed that both HKCI-1 and the primary tumor had the aflatoxin- associated mutation in codon 249 and an additional TP53 polymorphism in codon 72. Our present study demonstrates the value of combined SKY and CGH study in defining complex rearrangements and identifying cryptic translocations, and provides a comprehensive analysis on the chromosomal abnormalities in HKCI-1",

    "Title": "Detection of aberrations of 17p and p53 gene in gastrointestinal cancers by dual (two-color) fluorescence in situ hybridization and GeneChip p53 assay",
    "Abstract": "We performed dual (two-color) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using direct fluorescent labeling probes for p53 and chromosome 17 in six gastrointestinal (3 stomach and 3 colon) cancers. In three of these (1 stomach and 2 colon) the interphase cell nuclei showed an imbalance of signals for the p53 and chromosome 17; that is, the p53 signal count was lower than the chromosome 17 signal count, indicating deletion of the p53 gene. Moreover, metaphase FISH analysis demonstrated that those nuclei actually had a chromosome 17 with deletion of the p53 gene. Interestingly, these three cases had an abnormal chromosome 17 copy number, that is, chromosome 17 aneusomy. Furthermore, to investigate the possibility of p53 mutation in tumors with an imbalance of signals for chromosome 17 and p53 per nucleus, we performed a GeneChip p53 assay which has recently been developed. GeneChip p53 assay demonstrated that a primary tumor sample from one colon cancer case had a heterozygous point mutation of CGT (Arg) to CAT (His) at codon 273 in exon 8. In addition, a sample of metastatic tumor in the liver from the same case revealed two heterozygous point mutations. One of them was the same mutation as that is the primary tumor; the other was GTG (Val) to GGG (Gly) at codon 217 in exon 6. In conclusion, we found that the combination of dual-color FISH and GeneChip p53 assay offered reliable results and important information concerning not only deletion of the p53 gene and chromosome 17 aneusomy but also p53 mutations. Using these techniques, we demonstrated that an imbalance of signals for chromosome 17 and p53 per nucleus, chromosome 17 aneusomy, and accumulation of p53 mutations had occurred during carcinogenesis and development of gastrointestinal cancers",

    "Abstract": "We examined alterations of the p16INK4, p14ARF, p15, TP53, and MDM2 genes in 30 osteosarcomas and 24 Ewing sarcomas. Among 21 osteosarcomas and 24 Ewing sarcomas, p16INK4, p14ARF, and p15 abnormalities were found in 4 (19%), 2 (9%), and 3 (14%) osteosarcomas, respectively, and in 4 (17%), 3 (13%), and 4 (17%) Ewing sarcomas, respectively. The alterations of p16INK4, p14ARF, and p15 included homozygous deletions spanning all 3 genes, methylation of p16INK4 or p15, and a nonsense mutation of p16INK4, which simultaneously caused a missense mutation of p14ARF. Alterations of TP53 were found in 15 (50%) of 30 osteosarcomas and 1 (3%) of 24 Ewing sarcomas. None of the sarcomas showed MDM2 amplification. While TP53 abnormalities were far more frequent in osteosarcoma than in Ewing sarcoma, alterations of p16INK4, p14ARF, and p15 were present at similar frequencies in the two types of sarcoma. The event-free survival (EFS) was worse in Ewing sarcoma patients with p16INK4 and p14ARF mutation/deletion than in those without the mutation/deletion (P = 0.019), and EFS was worse in osteosarcoma patients with TP53 alterations than in those without TP53 alterations (P = 0.048). The different incidence of TP53 abnormalities in the 2 types of sarcoma may reflect differences of the molecular processes through which the 2 types of tumor develop",

    "Title": "Establishment and characterization of a new cell line derived from a human primary breast carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "A new cell line, designated HDQ-P1, was successfully established from a primary ductal infiltrating mammary carcinoma by using a 3T3 feeder layer lethally irradiated to 60 Gy. The HDQ-P1 cells have been grown in culture for over 115 passages and have a doubling time of 60 hours. Characterization of the cell line was performed. This included morphology by light and transmission electron microscopy, karyotype, growth rate, telomerase expression, tumor antigen expression, xenograft implantation into nude mice, colony formation in soft agar, TP53 sequencing, and gene copy number of C-MYC, C-ERBB-2, and C-H-RAS oncogenes. The epithelial nature of this cell line was confirmed by ultrastructural analysis, expression of cytokeratins, and epithelial membrane antigen. The HDQ-P1 cells possess an extensively rearranged and polyploid karyotype, with an average of 20 recurrent marker chromosomes. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that both primary tumor and HDQ-P1 cells were estrogen- and progesterone-receptor negative. The HDQ-P1 cells had the same expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase as other established breast cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3, and MCF-7. Direct DNA sequencing showed a point mutation which yielded to a stop codon at the amino acid 213 in exon 6 of the TP53 gene. A five-fold amplification of C-MYC was observed in HDQ-P1 cells. No amplification of C-ERBB-2 and C-H-RAS genes were observed. This cell line presents unique characteristics and may prove to be a good experimental model for investigating breast cancer biology",

    "Title": "Apoptosis and cell proliferation in the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma- sequence of Barrett's esophagus",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: The regulation of apoptosis as a distinctive form of cell death and proliferation in the process of carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus is poorly understood. To investigate regulation of apoptosis, proliferation and the participation of the tumor suppressor gene p53, we examined these parameters in Barrett's metaplasia, dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma. METHODOLOGY: Apoptotic cells were identified and quantified in tissue specimens of 45 patients with different stages of Barrett's esophagus and normal fundus epithelium, respectively, using the in situ end-labeling and electron microscopy method in combination with morphological criteria. The tumor suppressor gene p53 was examined by direct sequencing of exon 4-8 as well as immunohistochemically. The proliferative activity was assessed by Ki67 immunostaining. RESULTS: Apoptotic cell death, identified by the in situ end-labeling and ultrastructural technique was significantly increased in Barrett's epithelium with intestinal metaplasia than in specimens with normal fundic epithelium and Barrett's carcinomas (P < 0.01). The proliferative activity, defined as Ki67 labeling index, was highest in adenocarcinomas (P < 0.01). P53 mutations were found in 8/9 adenocarcinomas and 2/5 specimens with dysplasia. Apoptosis was lower in p53 positive specimens of the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma- sequence than in p53 negative specimens of Barrett's esophagus (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The higher levels of both apoptosis and proliferation indicate an increased cell turnover in Barrett's epithelium. Apoptosis seems to maintain tissue homeostasis, which is regulated by p53, and gradually lost in the metaplasia-dysplasia- carcinoma-sequence of Barrett's esophagus",

    "Title": "Somatic mutations of the APC, KRAS, and TP53 genes in nonpolypoid colorectal adenomas",
    "Abstract": "Colorectal adenomas are macroscopically visible morphological changes of the mucosa that can develop focal carcinoma in the absence of surgical intervention. The successive molecular changes proposed to occur at different stages in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence were primarily based on DNA studies of exophytic, polypoid-type adenomas. Not all colorectal lesions, however, display an exophytic phenotype and a presumed distinct colorectal neoplasm, the nonpolypoid adenoma, was subsequently described as a precursor of colorectal cancer. The low incidence of KRAS mutations in nonpolypoid colorectal adenomas reported previously suggested a different genetic basis for the transformation process in these lesions. We have pursued the identification of genetic changes in benign sporadic nonpolypoid colorectal adenomas in a selected Swedish patient group with no family history of colorectal cancer. Mutation screening of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), KRAS, and TP53 genes was conducted using the protein truncation test, heteroduplex-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis on PCR-amplified fragments. Fourteen mutations in the APC gene were characterized in 10/20 samples. Mutations in the KRAS and TP53 genes were identified in 3/57 and 4/51 adenomas, respectively. The mutation frequencies and distribution of mutations in APC correlate with published data on exophytic adenomas. The low mutation frequency of the TP53 gene is consistent with the benign nature of the research material. KRAS activation (an early event in polypoid colorectal adenomas) apparently does not play a significant role in nonpolypoid adenoma development but may result in the development of a polypoid configuration.

    "Title": "Molecular genetics of radiographically defined de novo glioblastoma multiforme",
    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents the final endpoint of anaplastic progression in astrocytomas. GBM which arise without clinical evidence of a prior low-grade astrocytoma (LGA) have been designated de novo GBM, and are thought to develop rapidly from initial tumour formation. However, a purely clinical definition of de novo GBM does not exclude a long-standing, asymptomatic low-grade tumour. This study therefore sought to determine the genetic features of a unique group of cases in which GBMs were documented to have arisen radiographically in defined period of time (radiographically defined de novo GBM). Clinical and genetic features were examined in a group of 11 patients with a histological diagnosis of high-grade astrocytoma at first biopsy and radiographically defined de novo GBM. The mean age of the patients at tumour diagnosis was 62 years (range 32-87). Six of 11 tumours arose in the temporal lobes. Eight of 11 tumours had epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression, and EGFR gene amplification was found in five of the six analysed cases. Overexpression of p53 was observed in only one tumour, and a TP53 mutation was present in this case. p16 immunostaining was undetectable in 10 cases, and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A was observed in four of the six studied tumours. pRb expression was lost in four tumours. Mutations in the PTEN gene were detected in two of six cases. The results in this unique group of cases confirms the prior hypothesis that the profile of genetic alterations in de novo GBM is distinct from that of GBM arising from a known LGA, and that these specific genetic pathways promote the rapid development of GBM",

    "Title": "Correlation between p53 gene mutations and p53 protein accumulation evaluated by different methodologies",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 gene are the most common genetic alterations in many tumour histotypes. Many of these mutations induce conformational changes resulting in p53 protein stabilisation and consequently an accumulation detectable with immunochemical methods. Available data on the correlation between p53 gene alterations and p53 overexpression widely vary. In this study we analysed the correlation between p53 gene alterations detected by DGGE, SSCP and sequencing and protein expression detected by flow cytometric and immunohistochemical approaches by using PAb 1801 antibody. The study was performed on 21 bladder tumours and 10 cell lines derived from different tumour histotypes as representative of different methodologic problems which can be met starting from different types of biological material. The best correlation (81%) was observed between p53 mutations and FCM results, using a double evaluation criterion for the latter which includes the percentage of positive cells and 'delta values', evaluated as the difference between the mean values of Pab 1801 stained cells and isotypic control. The high correlation obtained between results from this FCM double criterion and p53 gene mutations is a good starting point for the analysis on large series of tumours and for a multiparameter FCM analysis including p53 protein levels",

Such a complex cancer phenotype makes it difficult to recognize the carriers of the defective allele. Several studies undertaken to identify high-risk groups found germline p53 mutations in familial cancer aggregations and in patients with multiple tumors. We screened 189 pediatric and 48 adult patients. The high-risk groups comprised 41 patients with a family history of cancer and 35 with multiple neoplasms. Furthermore, 124 tumors were screened for somatic mutations. p53 exons 2 to 11 were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) followed by direct sequencing of abnormal DNA fragments. No germline p53 mutations were found and somatic mutations were detected in 5 of 59 sarcomas, globally, in 8 of 124 tumors. In conclusion, in Poland, p53 alterations do not seem very important for the predisposition to malignancy and development of sarcomas",

    "Abstract": "The risk of lung and breast cancer is significantly increased after therapy for Hodgkin's disease (HD), but there are few data that describe the molecular profiles of these tumors. We investigated the genetic abnormalities in second primary lung (n = 19) and breast cancers (n = 19) that follow therapy for HD ('post-HD cancers') and compared these with changes observed in corresponding tumor types (57 lung and 20 breast cancers) arising in the general population ('sporadic cancers'). DNA obtained from archival tissues was examined using PCR-based analyses for loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite alterations (MAs) at several chromosomal regions, TP53 and K-ras gene mutations, and frameshift mutations at minisatellite sequences at the coding regions of several genes (TGF-betaRII, IGFIIR, BAX, hMSH6, and hMSH3). The occurrence of loss of heterozygosity at all chromosomal regions taken together and frequencies at most individual areas were similar for the post-HD and sporadic cancers for both lung and breast sites. The overall frequency of MAs in the post-HD tumors was substantially greater (lung, 2.4-fold, P = 0.004; breast, 4.2-fold, P = 0.16) than that in the respective sporadic cancers. No differences in the pattern of TP53 and K-ras mutations were detected between post-HD and sporadic cancers. No mutations were detected at the minisatellite sequences examined. MAs, which reflect widespread genomic instability, occur at greatly increased frequency in post-HD lung and breast cancers. Although the mechanisms underlying the development of increased MAs are unknown, they have been associated with immunosuppression and radiation exposure. Future research should address the role that MAs, as well as other influences, may play in the development of neoplasias that occur after therapy for HD",

    "Abstract": "Loss of p53 function has been implicated in a wide variety of human malignacies. Many studies suggest that in cervical carcinoma p53 function is inactivated either by gene mutation or by complex formation with E6 oncoprotein product of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). The aim of this study was to determine the status of HPV infection and p53 gene mutation as well as their correlation in cervical carcinomas. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 12 cervicitis, 21 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3) and 17 squamous cell carcinomas were determined for the presence of HPV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and dot blot hybridization. The status of p53 mutations in exons 5-8 was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and confirmed by direct nucleotide sequencing. HPV infections were detected in all CIN 3 and squamous cell carcinomas (100%). Mutations of p53 were present in 3 of 38 HPV-positive samples: one with an ATG-->TTG transversion (Met-->Leu) in codon 237 of exon 7; and the others with a TGC-->TGG transversion (Cys-->Trp) in codon 242 of exon 7, and a CGT-- >CCT transversion (Arg-->Pro) in codon 273 of exon 8, respectively. Our findings show that the frequency of p53 mutation is low in primary cervical carcinoma and that the p53 gene mutation and HPV infection are not mutually exclusive events in the development of cervical cancer. Thus, other genetic events independent of p53 inactivation may also significantly contribute to the carcinogenesis of the uterine cervix",

    "Title": "Concurrent occurrence of gastric adenocarcinoma and duodenal neuroendocrine cell carcinoma: a composite tumour or collision tumours ?",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine cell (NEC) carcinoma is occasionally accompanied by adenocarcinoma but the relationship between these two morphologically distinct tumours is unclear. Two hypotheses have arisen regarding the mechanism for the association of adenocarcinoma and NEC carcinoma. One is that both are derived from a common multipotential epithelial stem cell. The second hypothesis is that adenocarcinoma and NEC carcinoma arise from a multipotential epithelial stem cell and a primitive NEC, respectively. AIMS: To elucidate the relationship between the two histologically distinct tumours, adenocarcinoma of the stomach and NEC carcinoma of the duodenum. PATIENT/METHODS: We present a case in which the tumour extended across the pyloric ring, the gastric portion of which revealed adenocarcinoma while the duodenal portion showed argyrophil NEC carcinoma. The two histologically distinct lesions of the tumour were examined by immunohistochemistry and genetic analysis of p53. RESULTS: The gastric region was negative for chromogranin A staining but positive for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) staining. In contrast, the duodenal region was positive for chromogranin A but negative for CEA. All tumour regions showed a point mutation in p53 gene at exon 7 (GGC (glycine)--&gt;GTC (valine) at codon 245). The distal portion of the duodenal tumour showed an additional point mutation in p53 gene at exon 5 (GCC (alanine)--&gt;GTC (valine) at codon 129). CONCLUSIONS: The two histologically distinct tumours, adenocarcinoma of the stomach and NEC carcinoma of the duodenum, appear to be derived from a common epithelial cell",

Because p53 abnormalities correlate with progressive and refractory disease in cancer and isochromosome 17q has been described in SLVL, a low-grade lymphoma that behaves aggressively in a minority of patients, this study investigated p53 changes by molecular and immunophenotypic methods in samples from 59 patients. The p53 deletion was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and p53 protein expression was assessed by immunocytochemistry in 35 of 59 cases and by flow cytometry in 20 of 35 patients. Ten patients (17%) had a monoallelic p53 loss, 3 (9%) of 35 nuclear protein expression by immunocytochemistry, and 2 (10%) of 20 by flow cytometry. Two patients had both deletion and protein expression. Direct sequencing of all p53 exons was used to delineate mutations in 9 of 11 patients with an identified abnormality. Mutations, both compromising p53 DNA binding, were identified in the 2 patients with deletion and protein accumulation. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly worse survival for patients with p53 abnormalities. Although p53 abnormalities are infrequent in SLVL, they underlie a more aggressive disease course and poor prognosis. (Blood. 2001;97:3552-3558)",

    "Title": "p53 dysfunction in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia: inactivation of ATM as an alternative to TP53 mutation",
    "Abstract": "The well-established association between TP53 mutations and adverse clinical outcome in a range of human cancers reflects the importance of p53 protein in regulating tumor-cell growth and survival. Although it is theoretically possible for p53 dysfunction to arise through mechanisms that do not involve TP53 mutation, such a phenomenon has not previously been demonstrated in a sporadic tumor. Here, we show that p53 dysfunction in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can occur in the absence of TP53 mutation and that such dysfunction is associated with mutation of the gene encoding ATM, a kinase implicated in p53 activation. Forty-three patients with CLL were examined for p53 dysfunction, as detected by impaired up-regulation of p53 and of the p53-dependent protein p21(CIP1/WAF1) after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). Thirty (70%) patients had normal p53 responses and underwent progressive IR-induced apoptosis. In 13 (30%) patients, p21 up-regulation was markedly impaired, indicating p53 dysfunction. Six (14%) of these patients with p53 dysfunction had increased baseline levels of p53, were found to have TP53 mutations, and were completely resistant to IR-induced apoptosis. In the other 7 (16%) patients with p53 dysfunction, IR-induced p53 up-regulation and apoptosis were markedly impaired, but baseline levels of p53 were not increased, and no TP53 mutations were detected. Each of these patients was found to have at least one ATM mutation, and a variable reduction in ATM protein was detected in all 4 patients examined. This is the first study to provide a direct demonstration that p53 dysfunction can arise in a sporadic tumor by a mechanism that does not involve TP53 mutation. (Blood. 2001;98:814-822)",

METHODS: Tumor material was analyzed for p53 mutations in primary colorectal tumors and subsequent liver metastases from 41 consecutive patients who were scheduled to undergo surgical liver resection. DNA sequencing and immunohistochemical staining of p53 protein within tumor nuclei were performed. RESULTS: Primary tumors displayed p53 mutations within exons 5-9 in 41% of patients. No mutations were found in exons 4, 10, or 11. Forty-one percent of metastatic lesions had the same single mutation that was found in the primary tumor, whereas 11% of metastatic lesions had one additional mutation within exons 5-9; 22% had mutations only in their liver metastases, whereas corresponding primary tumors displayed wild-type p53. None of the patients had mutated p53 in their primary tumor and wild type in their metastases. Survival after undergoing liver resection was correlated negatively (P &lt; 0.05-0.01) with Duke Stages A-D classification of the primary tumors, tumor differentiation, and radicality (&gt; 0.7-0.8 mm) of resected liver metastases. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of p53 mutations in patients with metastatic lesions was related significantly (P Y 0.003) to better survival after the patients underwent liver resection compared with patients with wild type p53 in their metastatic lesions. This finding was not related to covariates, such as Duke classification, tumor differentiation, type of liver metastasis, or metastatic radicality during resections. Explanations for this unexpected finding remain unclear, although the authors speculate that occult tumor cells with p53 mutations may be less responsive to growth factor(s) exposure during hepatic regeneration after resection.

    "Title": "Clinical sensitivity of p53 mutation detection in matched bladder tumor, bladder wash, and voided urine specimens",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene may correlate with an increased risk of recurrence and disease progression in patients with bladder carcinoma. The ability to accurately and sensitively detect p53 mutations in cytology specimens may be of benefit in the treatment of bladder carcinoma patients with superficial, minimally invasive disease. METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from 49 cases, each of which was comprised of matched bladder tumor tissue, bladder wash, and voided urine specimens obtained concurrently at a single institution. The genomic DNA was analyzed for mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene using a p53 mutation detection assay. Automated dideoxy sequencing of mutant specimens also was performed. RESULTS: Of the 49 cases, 29 (59%) showed no evidence of p53 mutations in the tumor, bladder wash, or voided urine specimens. Of the remaining 20 cases, 19 showed evidence of mutations in the tumor. Of these 19 p53 mutant bladder tumors, 16 (84%) were detected in the matched bladder wash and 16 (84%) were detected in the matched voided urine specimens. One case resulted in the detection of mutant p53 in the voided urine and the bladder wash, but not in the tumor. Analysis of the results between tumor tissue and bladder wash or tumor and voided urine showed 84.2% sensitivity, 96.8% specificity, and 91.8% accuracy. Sequence analysis of the mutant cases showed that the mutations detected in the tumor tissue were the same mutations detected in the bladder wash and the voided urine specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Both voided urine and bladder wash specimens from patients with bladder carcinoma were found to provide a high rate of clinical accuracy for the determination of the p53 gene status in patients with bladder tumors.

    "Title": "Significance of p53 mutations in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a sequential study of 30 patients",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), considerable disease heterogeneity within clinical stages necessitates the search for relevant prognostic indicators, particularly those that may help to determine the need for early therapeutic intervention. In the current study, the authors investigated the role of p53 mutations and chromosomal abnormalities in 30 patients with CLL. METHODS: Thirty patients were screened for p53 mutations. Half of the group had aggressive disease characterized by leucocytosis, lymph node enlargement, organomegaly, and shortened tumor doubling time. Because 95% of p53 mutations reside in &quot;hot-spot&quot; regions of exons 5-9 of the p53 gene, the authors sequenced these exons completely for mutation detection. RESULTS: Sequence analysis identified p53 mutations in 14 of 30 patients that were distributed equally among patients with aggressive disease and nonaggressive disease. There were six mutations in exon 7, five mutations in exon 5, and one mutation each in exons 6 and 8. Five of 15 patients with clinically aggressive disease had mutations in exon 7. Only one patient with nonaggressive disease had an exon 7 mutation. Abnormal cytogenetics were present in 22 of 30 patients (73%). Most patients with the p53 mutation (13 of 14 patients; 93%) displayed abnormal cytogenetics. Twelve of 15 patients with aggressive disease and 9 of 15 patients with average disease exhibited abnormal karyotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of p53 mutations did not predict clinical behavior or disease outcome, although the frequency of mutations appears to be higher than reported previously. In this study, mutations of exon 7 (5 of 6 patients) occurred in patients with clinically aggressive disease. The significance of this observation warrants further examination",

    "Title": "Apoptosis and proliferative activity in mature and immature teratomas of the mediastinum",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mediastinal teratomas are the most frequent mediastinal germ cell tumor. Whereas mature teratomas are benign tumors, immature teratomas are malignant. The purpose of this study was to find characteristics that could be used to distinguish between the growth and prognosis of the two teratoma types. METHODS: Twenty-four mediastinal teratomas (18 mature and 6 immature) were examined for apoptosis by 3'-end labeling of DNA and stained immunohistochemically for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Bcl-2, Bax, p53 protein, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) expression in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded specimens. RESULTS: AFP was expressed in both immature teratomas and mature teratomas. Whereas p53 protein was expressed by most teratomas, p53 gene mutation was observed in only one patient with an immature teratoma in which the same mutation occurred in all tumor tissue components tested. Bax protein expression was relatively diffuse in mature teratomas but was focally expressed in immature teratomas. Bcl-2 protein was expressed focally in both mature and immature teratomas. Although the proliferative index was significantly higher in immature teratomas compared with mature teratomas (P < 0.001), the apoptotic index (AI) was significantly higher in mature teratomas compared with immature teratomas (P < 0.05). All patients except one in this study remain alive and disease free after undergoing tumor resection. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively high AI in mature teratomas may be due to the overexpression of the p53 protein. In contrast, immature teratomas exhibited higher proliferative activity and lower rates of apoptosis, which may explain the more aggressive behavior of these tumors. However, patients with immature mediastinal teratomas have a good prognosis if the tumor is resected completely after chemotherapy",

    "Title": "Comparison of p53 mutations in patients with localized osteosarcoma and metastatic osteosarcoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In some malignancies, p53 mutations are associated with tumor progression. To address the role of p53 mutations in the development and progression of osteosarcoma, the authors analyzed specimens from 247 patients with primary localized osteosarcomas and 25 patients with osteosarcomas that were metastatic at the time of diagnosis. The group included 27 matched biopsy-resection specimens and 21 biopsy-metastasis paired specimens. METHODS: The authors examined the nature and location of p53 mutations (exons 4-10) by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and confirmed mutations by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The overall frequency of p53 mutations was 22% (60 of 272 specimens), with 13 of 60 mutations located in exons 4 or 10. A similar proportion of localized osteosarcomas had alterations of the p53 gene (55 of 247 specimens; 22.3%) compared with tumors from patients who had metastases at the time of diagnosis (5 of 25 specimens; 20%; P = 0.96). Patients who had p53 missense mutations were older compared with patients who had nonsense alterations or a wild type gene (P = 0.01). Examination of paired biopsy-resection and biopsy-metastasis specimens revealed that the p53 status was concordant between the biopsy and later tumor specimens in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The p53 mutation status did not differentiate between patients who presented with a localized osteosarcoma and those who presented with metastases at the time of diagnosis. The current data indicate that p53 mutations are not late events in osteosarcoma tumor progression, because they are evident before the development of metastases. The inclusion of exons 4 and 10 increased the sensitivity of the analysis",

    "Title": "Expression of apoptosis-related proteins, p53, and DNA fragmentation in sarcomas of the pulmonary artery",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Apoptosis is a common feature in a variety of pathologic conditions. Induction of apoptosis through apoptotic stimuli such as, chemotherapy or radiation, presents new insights into tumor biology and therapy. In particular, members of the Bcl-2 family as well as the Fas system are known to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis in different tumor entities. METHODS: In the current study, the expression of the apoptosis-related molecules p53, Bax, Bcl-2, Fas (CD95), Fas- Ligand and perforin was examined in 7 patients with a sarcoma of the pulmonary artery. Furthermore, the TUNEL-method for the detection of apoptotic cells was applied as well as sequencing of the p53 gene. RESULTS: In the TUNEL assay, approximately 10% of the sarcoma cells displayed DNA fragmentation. In addition, Bax was expressed in tumor cells. Accumulation of p53 was evident in 4 of 7 patients (pAB 240 antibody), and 2 of them were positive for the pAB 1801 antibody. Only 1 case had a point mutation in Exon 5 of the p53 sequence. A few tumor cells showed a double labeling of Bax and p53. Bcl-2 could be detected only in tumor-associated lymphocytes. Finally, several lymphocytes could be stained with perforin, but none of the specimens showed a reactivity for Fas or Fas-Ligand. CONCLUSION: The expression of Bax indicated a possible role of this molecule in programmed cell death in pulmonary sarcomas. The limited coexpression of Bax and p53 suggested that induction of Bax can occur independently of p53. The detection of perforin in lymphocytes suggested a possible role for this molecule in apoptosis of the sarcoma cells. In contrast, the Fas system did not seem to play an essential role in sarcomas of the great vessels",

    "Title": "Relevance of p53 Gene Alterations for Tumor Recurrence in Patients with Superficial Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The prognostic relevance of p53 protein accumulation in muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma is well documented, but the prognostic relevance of p53 alterations in superficial bladder tumors remains uncertain. Immunohistochemical data are divergent, possibly because of the use of nonstandardized techniques. We therefore investigated the relevance of p53 gene point mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for tumor recurrence. The results of this molecular analysis were compared with accumulation of the p53 protein as shown by immunohistochemistry. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Representative tumor tissue was selected and microdissected from 40 patients (pTa, 18 patients; pT1, 22 patients; grade I, 7 patients; grade II, 28 patients; grade III, 5 patients). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out with exons 5-8. All PCR products were screened for p53 mutations with temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE). When mobility shift was observed, direct nucleotide sequencing was performed. Detection of LOH was performed with nonradioactive microsatellite analysis using three markers (TP 53, D17S513 and D17S786) on chromosome 17p. Immunohistochemistry was performed with the DO 7 antibody. Tumor samples with p53 accumulation of 5% or more positive nuclei were classified as positive. Univariate analysis for disease-free survival was performed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. RESULTS: TGGE and direct sequencing detected mutations in 10 of 40 patients (2 of 18 pTa and 8 of 22 pT1 patients). LOH was detected in 11 patients. Both a mutation and LOH were detected in 3 patients. p53 immunohistochemistry detected at least 5% positive nuclei in 28 of 40 patients (70%). After a median follow-up of 26 months 14 patients suffered disease recurrence. Whereas disease-free survival did not correlate with a mutation (p = 0.77, log-rank test), LOH (p = 0.2) or a mutation in combination with LOH (p = 0.23), a positive p 53 immunoreaction was significantly associated with short disease-free survival (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Despite the relatively high percentage of patients with p53 gene alteration in this population no significant correlation between the detection of molecular alteration and disease recurrence could be found. We conclude that, in contrast to immunohistochemical accumulation, gene alterations play only a minor role in tumor recurrence of p53 in patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, and that immunohistochemical accumulation of the p53 protein has to be explained by mechanisms other than gene mutations",

    "Title": "P53 mutation does not affect prognosis in ovarian epithelial malignancies",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 tumour suppressor gene have been found in most human cancers, including ovarian epithelial malignancies. This study investigated whether the presence or absence of p53 mutation was associated with outcome following platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with ovarian cancer. DNA samples from tumour tissue and blood were obtained from 73 patients with primary tumours, 50 of whom received platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing of exons 5-8 detected mutations in 44% (32 of 73) of tumours. These were more common in late-stage (III or IV) than in early-stage disease (I or II) (p=0.03). There was no association with histological type, volume of residual disease following surgery, or initial CA125 levels. No significant association was found between p53 status and overall survival or disease-free survival following chemotherapy. Likewise, there was no correlation between p53 mutation and response to chemotherapy as defined by normalization of CA125 levels. Tumours with p53 missense mutations recurred within a significantly shorter time than those with normal p53 (p=0.04). In addition, there was a tendency for tumours with missense mutations to have a shorter disease-free survival than those with non-missense mutations, although this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.07).

    "Title": "Mechanisms of oncogenesis in colon versus rectal cancer",
    "Abstract": "Observations support the theory that development of left- and right- sided colorectal cancers may involve different mechanisms. This study investigated different genes involved in oncogenesis of colon and rectal cancers and analysed their prognostic value. The study group comprised 35 colon and 42 rectal cancers. Rectal cancer patients had been treated with standardized surgery performed by an experienced rectal cancer surgeon. Mutation analysis was performed for p53 in eight colon cancers and for APC and p53 in 22 rectal cancers. MLH1, MSH2, Bcl- 2, p53, E-cadherin and beta-catenin were investigated by immunohistochemistry in all colorectal tumours. APC mutation analysis of the MCR showed truncating mutations in 18 of 22 rectal tumours (82%), but the presence of an APC mutation was not related to nuclear beta-catenin expression (p=0.75). Rectal cancers showed significantly more nuclear beta-catenin than colon cancers (65% versus 40%, p=0.04). p53 mutation analysis corresponded well with p53 immunohistochemistry (p<0.001). Rectal cancers showed significantly more immunohistochemical expression of p53 than colon cancers (64% versus 29%, p=0.003). In rectal cancers, a significant correlation was found between positive p53 expression and worse disease-free survival (p=0.008), but not in colon cancers. Cox regression showed that p53-expression (p=0.03) was an independent predictor for disease-free survival in rectal cancers. This study concluded that rectal cancer may involve more nuclear beta- catenin in the APC/beta-catenin pathway than colon cancer and/or nuclear beta-catenin may have another role in rectal cancer independently of APC. The p53-pathway seems to be more important in rectal cancer, in which it also has independent prognostic value. When prognostic markers are investigated in larger series, differences in biological behaviour between colon and rectal cancer should be considered",

    "Title": "Mutation of the p51/p63 gene is associated with blastic crisis in chronic myelogenous leukemia",
    "Abstract": "The p51/p63 gene, a novel member of the p53 gene family, has recently been identified at 3q27-9. There are at least six major isotypes of p51/p63 mRNA transcripts. p51A/TAp63gamma has the potential to induce apoptosis and growth suppression in a manner similar to p53, and other isotypes may suppress the p53 and p51A1TAp63gamma genes in a dominant- negative manner. We analyzed the mutation and expression of the p51/p63 gene in 80 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to evaluate its role in blastic transformation. Expression of the p51/p63 gene was detected in 74 cases. The alpha isotype of p51/p63 transcripts was dominantly expressed in 72 of these 74 cases. There was no correlation between the isotypes of p51/p63 transcripts and the clinical phase. Mutations of the p51/p63 gene were found in six cases. All these mutated cases expressed p51B/TAp63 alpha. In four of the six cases, the mutations were within a limited region (codon 151-170) corresponding to the DNA-binding domain. We hypothesized that this limited region is a hot spot for mutation of the p51/p63 gene. Mutations of the p53 gene were found in four cases of CML in blastic crisis (BC). Frequencies of the p51/p63 and p53 gene mutations were higher in BC (p51/p63 gene, 11.8%; p53 gene, 7.8%) than in the chronic phase (p51/p63 gene, 1.5%; p53 gene, 0%). The p51/p63 gene mutation may act similarly to the p53 gene mutation as a genetic alteration potentially responsible for the progression of CML",

    "Title": "Distinct pattern of TP53 mutations in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus in Iran.",
    "Abstract": "Extremely high rates of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (SCCE) are observed in Iran, reflecting unknown, genetic and/or epidemiological risk factors. Among genetic alterations in SCCE, TP53 mutations are the most frequent, vary among populations, and may provide clues on etiological mechanisms. We have analysed mutations in TP53 (exons 5-8) in 98 SCCE from Iran by temporal temperature gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing. We found 58 mutations in 49 patients (50%), with a high prevalence of C to T transitions at CpG dinucleotides (29.3%). The TP53 mutation pattern in Iran was significantly different from that observed in SCCEs from high incidence areas of China and Western Europe (P=0.007). Moreover, the prevalence of mutations at A : T base pairs (transitions and transversions) was higher in men than in women (38.7% vs 11.1%, P=0.033). COX-2 overexpression was detected in 69% of the cases evaluated (24/35), without significant association with TP53 mutation. Accumulation of nitrotyrosine, a marker of protein damage by excess levels of nitric oxide, was observed in tumor cells in six of 16 cases analysed. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that several factors are involved in TP53 mutagenesis in Iran. These factors include a baseline of chronic inflammatory stress, which may have a multiplicative impact on the sensitivity of esophageal cells to exogenous factors of risk",

    "Title": "INK4a-ARF alterations and p53 mutations in hepatocellular carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "The INK4a-ARF (CDKN2A)- locus on chromosome 9p21 encodes for two tumour suppressor proteins, p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), that act as upstream regulators of the Rb-CDK4 and p53 pathways. To study the contribution of each pathway in tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we analysed the alterations of p14(ARF), p16(INC4a) and p53. After microdissection, DNA of 71 hepatocellular carcinomas was analysed for INK4-ARF inactivation and p53 mutation by DNA sequence analysis, methylation-specific PCR (MSP), restriction-enzyme related polymerase chain reaction (RE-PCR), mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry. In addition, microdeletion of p14(ARF) and p16(INC4a) were assessed by differential PCR. Inactivation of p14(ARF) was found in 11/71 cases (15%), alterations of p16(INK4a) occurred in 47/71 carcinomas (66%), which correlated with loss of mRNA transcription. Five tumours (7%) had homozygous deletions of the INK4a-ARF locus. We failed to detect specific mutations of both exons. P16(INK4a) methylation with an unmethylated p14(ARF) promotor appeared in 39 cases. Mutations of p53 were found in 30 of 71 HCC (42%), and only one of them harboured p14(ARF) inactivation. We failed to establish alterations of the INK4a- ARF locus or p53 status as independent prognostic factor in these tumours. Our data indicate, that p14(ARF) methylation occurs independently of p16(INK4a) alterations in a subset of HCC together with wild type p53. The INK4a-ARF-/p53-pathway was disrupted in 86% of HCC, either by p53 mutations or by INK4a-ARF inactivation, and may have co-operative effects in hepatocarcinogenesis",

    "Title": "In situ detection of unexpected patterns of mutant p53 gene expression in non-small cell lung cancers",
    "Abstract": "Many solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), are characterized by heterogenous expression of p53 protein in the neoplastic cells. To analyse the molecular implications of this finding, we examined topographic distribution of p53 mutations using in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in primary NSCLCs, showing distinct patterns of variable p53 overexpression by immunohistochemistry. Unique sets of primers for each mutation were designed, and optimal PCR conditions were determined by standard PCR using DNA from cloned mutants or cell lines established from these tumors. All tumor cell nuclei, regardless of the status of p53 overexpression, demonstrated homogeneous distribution of mutant p53 with specific primers, indicating that only subgroups of the mutated cells overexpressed p53 protein. In situ reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was applied to detect mutant mRNA in the individual tumor cells using specific primers. We found that in each case the distribution of mutant p53 mRNA coincided with that of immunohistochemical overexpression of p53 protein. Our results suggest that the regulation of mutant p53 expression, but not the genotype, is heterogeneous in the neoplastic cells. The topographic genomapping of p53 in NSCLC using in situ PCR provides a novel approach to view molecular mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Evidence for oligoclonality and tumor spread by intraluminal seeding in multifocal urothelial carcinomas of the upper and lower urinary tract",
    "Abstract": "Multifocality and recurrence of urothelial carcinoma may result from either the field effect of carcinogens leading to oligoclonal tumors or monoclonal tumor spread. Previous molecular studies, favoring the monoclonality hypothesis, are mostly limited to the urinary bladder. We investigated genetic alterations in a total of 94 synchronous or metachronous multifocal tumors from 19 patients with at least one tumor both in the upper and lower urinary tract. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was determined using eight markers on chromosome 9 and one marker on 17p13 (p53). Microsatellite instability was investigated at six loci and protein expression of MSH2 and MLH1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. In addition, exons 5-9 of the p53 gene were sequenced. Deletions at chromosome 9 were found in 73% of tumors and at 17p13 in 18% of tumors. There was no significant difference in the frequency of LOH in the upper and lower urinary tract. Deletions at 9p21 were significantly correlated with invasive tumor growth. The pattern of deletion revealed monoclonality of all tumors in nine patients. In five patients there were at least two tumor clones with different genetic alterations. In four of these patients the different clones occurred in the bladder and subsequently in the ureter and renal pelvis. All four patients with p53 mutations revealed identical mutations in all tumors. Thus, multifocal urothelial carcinomas are frequently monoclonal, whereas others show oligoclonality, providing molecular evidence for field cancerization. Intraluminal tumor cell seeding appears to be an important mechanism of multifocal occurrence and recurrence of urothelial carcinomas",

    "Abstract": "A number of genetic alterations have been described in colorectal cancers. They include allelic losses on specific chromosomal arms, mutations of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and mismatch repair genes, microsatellite instability in coding repeat sequences of target genes and methylation defects in gene promoters. Since these alterations have been reported by different groups on different tumors and cell lines, the complete repertoire of genetic alterations for any given tumor sample remains unknown. In the present study, we analysed a series of 22 colorectal cancer cell lines for 31 different genetic alterations. We found significant correlations between mutational profiles in these colorectal cell lines associated with differences in mismatch repair status.

    "Title": "Genome instability in secondary solid tumors developing after radiotherapy of bilateral retinoblastoma",
    "Abstract": "Genome alterations of seven secondary tumors (five osteosarcomas, one malignant peripheral sheath nerve tumor, one leiomyosarcoma) occurring in the field of irradiation of patients treated for bilateral retinoblastoma have been studied. These patients were predisposed to develop radiation-induced tumors because of the presence of a germ line mutation in the retinoblastoma gene (RB1). Tumor cells were characterized by a high chromosome instability whereas microsatellites and minisatellites were found to be stable. In all tumors, the normal RB1 allele was lost with the corresponding chromosome 13, whereas the germ line mutated allele was retained. The two alleles of TP53 were inactivated, one by deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17, the other by mutation. As compared with non-radiation-induced tumors, the observed panel of TP53 mutations was uncommon with sites not recurrently found otherwise and a high rate of deletions (3/7). In these predisposed patients, the loss of the single normal allele of RB1 is rather due to the radiation-induced chromosome instability than a direct effect of ionizing radiation",

    "Title": "Genetic changes in contralateral bronchioloalveolar carcinomas of the lung",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The pattern of metastases and recurrence of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) differs from adenocarcinoma of the lung, occurring more frequently within the lung without extrapulmonary involvement. Analyses of genetic differences of contralateral BACs may help to explain these clinical differences. METHODS: We compared paired tumors from 5 patients with contralateral metachronous BACs for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 6 chromosomal arms (2q, 3p, 5q, 9p, 13q and 17p) and mutational analysis of p53 and K-ras. RESULTS: Two patients, patients 1 and 2, had discordant patterns of LOH on 2 and 3 of the chromosome arms, respectively. In addition, patient 2 had a detectable K-ras mutation in his initial tumor but not in his second. These results suggest that in patients 1 and 2, the contralateral tumors were clonally unrelated. Patient 3 had no mutations in the K-ras or p53 gene and no LOH on any of the 5 informative chromosome arms. Patient 4 had LOH of 9p and mutated K-ras in both the first and the second tumor, with a mutation in the p53 gene in the first but not in the second tumor. Patient 5 had LOH of 17p and the same p53 mutations in both the first and the second tumor, with a mutation of K-ras in the first tumor but not in the second. CONCLUSIONS: The preponderance of evidence suggests that in patients 3, 4 and 5, the paired tumors were clonally related. The different patterns of LOH and mutations in clinically similar contralateral metachronous BACs provide evidence of genetic heterogeneity in the tumors of this patient group",

    "Title": "Evaluation of methods to detect p53 mutations in ovarian cancer",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The p53 status is increasingly regarded as a marker predictive of response to particular cancer therapies, but for this approach it is self-evident that the p53 status must be determined correctly. METHODS: We have tested ovarian cancers with single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP), immunohistochemical staining with DO-1 anti-p53 antibody (IHC), and yeast p53 functional assay (FASAY). RESULTS: These techniques commonly used to detect p53 mutations showed important differences in their sensitivity. Of 53 tumors tested with three indirect techniques, 27 (50%), 33 (62%) and 41 (77%) were positive by SSCP, IHC, and FASAY, respectively. In a subset of 32 tumors strongly suspected of containing mutations, 25 (78%), 26 (81%), 29 (91%) and 30 (94%) were positive by SSCP, immunostaining, DNA sequencing and yeast assay, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Under comparable routine conditions, the FASAY reached the highest sensitivity. Since no single technique detected all mutations, we recommend the use of at least two different techniques in situations where the p53 status will affect patient management",

    "Abstract": "A new cell line (SKS) established from ascites of a patient with neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix had a good tumorigenicity and caused marked peritoneal dissemination, and was also highly sensitive to gemcitabine in an in vitro chemosensitivity test. SKS cells were small round cells with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio and grew into colony-like aggregates, forming spherical aggregates of floating cells. The population doubling time was 44 h. The number of chromosomes ranged from 50 to 56. On examination of the ultrastructure, membrane-bound dense-core neurosecretory-type granules were observed in the cytoplasm. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was immunocytochemically positive in the cytoplasm, and 9.3 ng/ml of NSE was detected in the cell culture supernatant. Human papillomavirus was not detected. In the p53 gene, a 3-bp deletion, AAC (Asn), was detected at codon 131 in exon 5. SKS exhibited good tumorigenicity, and the tumor doubling time was 11 days. Intraperitoneal injection of the cells caused peritoneal dissemination, and marked ascites formation was observed. SKS was highly sensitive to gemcitabine, and the 50% growth inhibitory concentration was 30 nM. SKS cells are useful as a model of neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma of the cervix, and chemotherapy using gemcitabine may possibly be effective in this malignancy",

    "Title": "Detection of Human Papillomavirus DNA and p53 Gene Mutations in Esophageal Cancer Samples and Adjacent Normal Mucosa",
    "Abstract": "Background/Aim: There is evidence of a possible etiological role of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) in the development of esophageal tumors. Loss of function of the wild-type p53 tumor suppressor gene product by binding to E6 oncoproteins of high-risk HPVs is considered an important event in tumor development. The aim of this study was to verify the prevalence of HPV infection and p53 mutation in esophageal tumor tissue samples and in the adjacent normal mucosa in patients from a high-risk area in Italy. Methods: DNA from 33 biopsy specimens (17 tumor sample biopsies and 16 samples of adjacent normal mucosa) was screened for HPV DNA using two polymerase chain reaction based procedures. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used for typing. Screening of p53 mutations was performed with polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. Results: Overall, 8 of 17 patients presented HPV DNA; HPV 16 was detected in 4 of 8 samples. Samples from tumors and adjacent mucosa were positive for mucosal HPVs in 7 of 17 and 4 of 16 cases, respectively. In 1 case, HPV DNA was detected in the normal mucosa only. None of the samples contained HPVs of the epidermodysplasia verruciformis or cutaneous groups. Mutations of p53 were detected in two HPV DNA negative samples. In both cases, the mutation was present in the tumor only. Conclusions: Our results are in favor of the involvement of both aberrant p53 expression and HPV infection in the development of esophageal tumors. The high HPV infection rate in patients from a high-risk region suggests that subjects harboring HPVs (in particular HPV 16) in the esophagus should be considered at risk of esophageal malignancies",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) arises from intrahepatic bile duct epithelium and is the second most prevalent among primary liver cancers. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of cholangiocarcinogenesis. METHODS: We studied the incidence of microsatellite instability (MSI) involving eight highly polymorphic microsatellite markers and alternations of the K-ras, p53 and mdm-2 genes in human ICC tissues. Overexpression of mdm-2 oncoprotein was also immunohistochemically studied. RESULTS: Of all 65 cases examined, K-ras gene mutation was found in three cases (4.6%) at codon 12. Analysis of p53 alterations was performed in 28 cases including 22 frozen samples and mutations were found in three cases (10.7%). Overexpression of mdm-2 protein was observed in 25 (41.7%) out of 60 cases analyzed. In 22 frozen samples, seven (31.8%) cases showed mdm-2 amplification and four (18.2%) cases revealed MSI-positive phenotype. Among the cases analyzed, all the tumors with mdm-2 amplification/overexpression harbored the wild-type p53 gene and all the microsatellite instability-positive cases were from mass-forming (MF) + periductal-infiltrating (PI) subtype.

    "Title": "p53 mutations are rare events in recurrent cervical cancer",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 gene have been shown to be associated with aggressive growth behavior and increased recurrence rates for certain tumors. Primary cervical cancers contain oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) in more than 90% of cases and usually possess wild-type p53 alleles. Cervical cancer cells contain detectable levels of functional p53 protein despite of the expression of the HPV E6 protein, which can induce p53 degradation. Thus, inactivation of p53 by somatic mutation should have functional consequences in HPV-positive cancers. We investigated whether p53 mutations play a role in the recurrence of the disease by analyzing p53 status in 18 biopsy specimens from recurrent cervical cancers. Only one of these (5.6%) contained a p53 mutation, as assessed by a sensitive yeast functional assay that detects mutations of the p53 mRNA between codons 52 and 364. These results indicate that p53 mutations are rare events in recurrent cervical carcinomas, and that somatic mutations of p53 do not provide cervical cancer cells with a selective growth advantage for recurrence",

    "Title": "The timing and characterization of p53 mutations in progression from atypical ductal hyperplasia to invasive lesions in the breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "The main reason for the recent interest in p53 is that almost 50% of human cancers contain p53 gene mutations. The majority of studies on p53 alterations in breast cancer have been limited to the isolated cases of ductal carcinoma in situ and infiltrating ductal carcinoma. The aims of this study were to determine the status and timing of p53 mutation in the progression from atypical ductal hyperplasia to invasive cancer, and to evaluate the patterns of p53 mutations in noninvasive and invasive lesions. Available lesions of invasive (n=88) and noninvasive (n=76) lesions were microdissected in 107 paraffin- embedded tissues (19 ductal carcinomas in situ, 57 invasive carcinomas with intraductal components, and 31 pure invasive carcinomas) and double-strand DNA sequencing was performed in exon 4-9 of the p53 gene. Among in situ cancers without invasive disease 36.8% had p53 mutations whereas in situ cancer with concurrent invasive disease showed p53 mutations in 33.3% of cases. In particular, two of seven atypical ductal hyperplasias harbored p53 alterations (one insertion and one missense mutation) in exon 8. The invasive component harbored p53 mutations in 30 of 88 cases (34.1%). We also discovered a novel deletion of 14 bp in exon 6 of two invasive lesions. The invasive component (1.33+/-0.13) carried a greater number of p53 mutations than its counterparts (1.19+/-0.10) and demonstrated more frequent multiple mutations (23.3% vs. 15.4%), but without statistical significance. Moreover, no statistical significance could be attached to the mutation frequency in the zinc-binding domains (26.7% vs. 15.4%), the directly DNA contact region (13.3% vs. 15.4%) and the missense mutation of p53 (50.0% vs. 57.7%) of the two groups. Based on our results, in spite of the small number of the lesions investigated, p53 mutation can occur at the stage of atypical ductal hyperplasia. The hypermutability and the specific p53 mutations involving the biologically functional domain (e.g., zinc binding domain or DNA contact region) have an insignificant influence on invasive progression in the breast cancer",

    "Title": "Loss of CD95 expression is linked to most but not all p53 mutants in European hepatocellular carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Experimental data have shown p53-dependent CD95 induction to be associated with increased levels of apoptosis after cytostatic treatment in hepatoma cells. A study of Japanese hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has reported an inverse correlation between CD95 and p53 expression. To examine the interaction of p53 and CD95 in tumors we investigated which alterations in p53 can be linked to loss of CD95 expression in European HCC. In 39 tumors we analyzed CD95 by immunohistochemistry and assessed the correlation between the findings of the p53 status as determined by immunohistochemistry and single- strand conformation polymorphism with polymerase chain reaction sequencing. In 10 of 14 tumors with evidence of p53 aberration there was also loss of CD95 expression, compared to 6 of 25 samples with apparent wild-type p53 (P<0.01). Three tumors with p53 mutations but sustained CD95 expression showed single base substitutions mapping to a narrow region of 20 codons in p53. A significant correlation with differentiation status of the tumor was found for the p53 aberration but not for CD95 expression. This is the first study to link loss of CD95 expression to specific p53 alterations in HCC. Functional p53 appears to be a major factor for CD95 expression in hepatocytes, the loss of which could contribute to chemoresistance and possibly immune evasion in hepatocellular carcinoma. Sustained CD95 expression in tumors with certain p53 aberrations may indicate functional heterogeneity of p53 mutants",

To explore the implication of p53 alteration in Ewing's sarcoma, we analyzed the deletion and sequence alterations of p53 and abnormal amplification of MDM2, which acts as a functional inhibitor of p53, in 35 tissue specimens. Quantitative genomic PCR analysis showed that 2 of 35 tumors have extremely low levels of the p53 gene, indicating a homozygous deletion of the gene. Mutational analysis of exons 4 to 9 of p53 by PCR-SSCP revealed that 3 of 35 tumors carry sequence alterations in exons 5 or 8, and DNA sequencing analysis identified missense point mutations at codon 132 (AAGright curved arrow ATG, lysineright curved arrow methionine) and codon 135 (TGCright curved arrow TCC, cysteinright curved arrow serine) in exon 5, and codon 287 (GAGright curved arrow GTG, glutamic acidright curved arrow valine) in exon 8 from these tumors. No abnormal amplification of the MDM2 gene was recognized. Taken together, our data demonstrate that p53 is genetically altered in a small fraction of Ewing's sarcoma",

    "Title": "Unusual profile and high prevalence of p53 mutations in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas from northern Iran",
    "Abstract": "Over 15,000 human tumor p53 mutations have been recorded in the scientific literature, including over 700 mutations in esophageal tumors. There are no data on p53 mutations in esophageal cancer patients from Iran yet; however, this country experiences one of the highest cancer mortality rates in the world for esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). The causes of this high cancer burden in Iran remain obscure and do not appear to be related to tobacco and alcohol consumption, the two major risk factors identified in Europe and North America. Because molecular analysis of tumors can provide clues to endogenous or environmental factors contributing to high cancer risk, we examined 74 Iranian ESCCs for the presence of mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene by PCR and direct sequencing. Forty-eight of the 74 tumors (65%) had one or more p53 gene point mutations, including 5 patients with two or more mutations and one with a tandem mutation in codon 242. Surprisingly, over one-third of the 54 mutations we identified were transitions at CpG sites (20 of a total of 54 mutations, or 37%), a class of mutation that is significantly less common (16% of mutations) in the compilation of ESCC mutations from other countries (chi2 statistic, P &lt; 0.0002), whereas transversions, which the literature shows to be common in ESCCs from non-Iranian patients, were infrequent in the tumors we examined here. Elevated levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase were observed in 74 and 91%, respectively, of tumors from Tehran as determined by immunohistochemistry, and high COX-2 expression correlated significantly with the presence of a p53 mutation in the tumor. Mediators of the inflammatory response in esophageal mucosa, perhaps in conjunction with specific dietary or cultural practices in Iran, may contribute importantly to the p53 mutation load in Iranian ESCC patients",

    "Title": "Ethnicity delineates different genetic pathways in malignant glioma",
    "Abstract": "In the United States and the San Francisco Bay Area, whites are nearly twice as likely as non-whites to develop brain cancer. To test whether prevalence and types of alterations in the p53 pathway in brain tumor development may explain some of this difference in risk, we have analyzed the p53 status of astrocytic gliomas from a population-based sample of cases within our San Francisco Bay Area Adult Glioma Study. We identified mutations in exons 5-8 of p53 using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from 146 whites and 26 non-whites with astrocytic glioma by PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. Tumor P53 protein (TP53) immunohistochemistry (IHC) available for 164 of these cases showed that tumors from 50% (13 of 26) of non-whites and 32% (44 of 138) of whites contained intense IHC staining for TP53, indicating persistence of TP53 protein. Irrespective of IHC status, tumors from 42% (11 of 26) of non-whites versus 13% (19 of 146) of whites contained p53 mutations (age/gender-adjusted odds ratio, 5.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-15.1; P = 0.0004). Patients with p53 mutation-positive tumors were also significantly younger than patients with mutation-negative tumors and somewhat more likely to be female. A higher proportion of tumors from non-whites than from whites had transition mutations, but there were similar proportions of transversion mutations in tumors from whites and non-whites. Whites and non-whites also had similar proportions of tumors with p53 mutations that stained intensely for TP53 (78 and 82%, respectively). Because whites have higher risk for glioma than non-whites in this population, that the gliomas from whites were less likely than those from non-whites to have p53 mutation suggests that whites may be more likely than non-whites to be at risk for the more common type of astrocytic gliomas, which do not contain p53 mutations",

    "Title": "Influence of TP53 gene alterations and c-erbB-2 expression on the response to treatment with doxorubicin in locally advanced breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "TP53 status [mutations, immunostaining, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH)], expression of c-erbB-2, bcl-2, and histological grading were correlated to the response to doxorubicin monotherapy (14 mg/m2) administered weekly to 90 patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Mutations in the TP53 gene, in particular those affecting or disrupting the loop domains L2 or L3 of the p53 protein, were associated with lack of response to chemotherapy (P = 0.063 for all mutations and P = 0.008 for mutations affecting L2/L3, respectively). Similarly, expression of c-erbB-2 (P = 0.041), a high histological grade (P = 0.023), and lack of expression of bcl-2 (P = 0.018) all predicted chemoresistance. No statistically significant association between either p53 immunostaining or TP53 LOH and response to therapy was recorded, despite the finding that both were associated with TP53 mutation status (p53 immunostaining, P &lt; 0.001; LOH, P = 0.021). Lack of immunostaining for p53 despite mutation of the TP53 gene was particularly seen in tumors harboring nonsense mutations or deletions/splices (7 of 10 negative for staining compared with 4 of 16 with missense mutations). TP53 mutations (total/affecting L2/L3 domains) were associated with expression of c-erbB-2 (P &lt; 0.001 for both), high histological grade (P = 0.001 and P = 0.025), and bcl-2 negativity (P = 0.003 and P = 0.002). TP53 mutations, histological grade, and expression of bcl-2 (but not LOH or c-erbB-2 expression) all predicted for relapse-free as well as breast cancer-specific survival in univariate analysis (Ps between &lt;0.0001 and 0.0155), but only tumor grade was found to be predictive in multivariate analysis (P = 0.01 and P = 0.0007, respectively). Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that certain TP53 mutations predict for resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer patients. However, the observation that the majority of patients with TP53 mutations affecting or disrupting the L2/L3 domains with LOH in addition (n = 12) obtained a partial response (n = 4) or stabilization of disease (n = 5) during chemotherapy suggests redundant mechanisms to compensate for loss of p53 function. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that other defects may act in concert with loss of p53 function, causing resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancers",

    "Title": "Association between DNA repair-deficiency and high level of p53 mutations in Melanoma of Xeroderma Pigmentosum",
    "Abstract": "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an inheritable disease characterized by sun-sensitivity and a high frequency of skin cancers including melanoma. We have analyzed two different groups of XP: the XP complementation group C (XP-C), deficient in global nucleotide excision repair but proficient in transcription-coupled repair and associated with a very early onset of skin cancers; and the XP variant (XPV), deficient in the bypass of DNA photoproducts. To get new insights into the biology of melanoma in XP patients, we studied 20 melanomas from four XP-C and two XPV patients in terms of pathology, immunohistochemistry of p53, mutations in exons 4-9 of the p53 gene, and polymorphisms of the p53 gene at codon 72. All statistical tests were two-sided. The majority of the XP melanomas were of the lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) type, as found in the elderly. p53 point mutations were found in 60% of XP-C melanomas and in only 10% of XPV melanomas, this latter frequency being similar to what has been reported in the general population. Mutations show the specific UV-signature because the majority were CC to TT tandem and C to T transitions located at the bipyrimidine sites known to be hotspots of UV-induced DNA lesions. All DNA lesions giving rise to mutations in XP-C melanomas were located on the nontranscribed strand of the p53 gene, demonstrating that these patients' cells were able to carry out preferential repair in vivo. The LMMs found in XP-C are associated with an accumulation of unrepaired DNA lesions and may represent a good model for the LMM induction in the elderly.",

    "Title": "Different mechanisms of radiation-induced loss of heterozygosity in two human lymphoid cell lines from a single donor",
    "Abstract": "Allelic loss is an important mutational mechanism in human carcinogenesis. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at an autosomal locus is one outcome of the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and can occur by deletion or by mitotic recombination. We report that mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes occurred in human lymphoid cells exposed to densely ionizing radiation. We used cells derived from the same donor that express either normal TP53 (TK6 cells) or homozygous mutant TP53 (WTK1 cells) to assess the influence of TP53 on radiation-induced mutagenesis. Expression of mutant TP53 (Met 237 Ile) was associated with a small increase in mutation frequencies at the hemizygous HPRT (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase) locus, but the mutation spectra were unaffected at this locus. In contrast, WTK1 cells (mutant TP53) were 30-fold more susceptible than TK6 cells (wild-type TP53) to radiation-induced mutagenesis at the TK1 (thymidine kinase) locus. Gene dosage analysis combined with microsatellite marker analysis showed that the increase in TK1 mutagenesis in WTK1 cells could be attributed, in part, to mitotic recombination. The microsatellite marker analysis over a 64-cM region on chromosome 17q indicated that the recombinational events could initiate at different positions between the TK1 locus and the centromere. Virtually all of the recombinational LOH events extended beyond the TK1 locus to the most telomeric marker. In general, longer LOH tracts were observed in mutants from WTK1 cells than in mutants from TK6 cells. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the incidence of radi-ation-induced mutations is dependent on the genetic background of the cell at risk, on the locus examined, and on the mechanisms for mutation available at the locus of interest",

    "Title": "Analysis of complex relationships between age, p53, epidermal growth factor receptor, and survival in glioblastoma patients",
    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) carries a dismal prognosis. However, a range of survival times exists, and parameters that define prognostic groups may help to optimize treatment. To identify such prognostic groups, we analyzed tumor tissue from 110 cases of newly diagnosed GBM from two clinical protocols. Similar to other studies, we found no association of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression (as assessed by immunohistochemistry), p53 immunopositivity, or p53 mutation with survival in the entire sample. However, EGFR overexpression showed trends toward worse prognosis in patients younger than the median age, but better prognosis in patients older than the median age. This interaction of EGFR with age group was statistically significant and led us to focus our further analyses on the younger patients. In this group, a statistically significant association of EGFR overexpression with worse survival was identified in the p53-negative but not p53-positive tumors. We found a similar result after screening these cases for mutations in p53: EGFR overexpression was negatively associated with survival only in the p53 wild-type cases. To confirm this unexpected result, this finding was reproduced in a validation sample of an additional 42 tumors from younger patients on the same two clinical protocols. This complex relationship between EGFR and p53 in younger patients remained in a multivariate analysis that incorporated additional prognostic variables. The results suggest that analysis of prognostic markers in GBM is complex, and maximal information may require analysis of subgroups based on age and the status of specific markers such as p53. In addition, they suggest a specific group of patients on which to focus promising therapies targeting EGFR",

    "Title": "Deregulated expression of c-mos in non-small cell lung carcinomas: relationship with p53 status, genomic instability, and tumor kinetics",
    "Abstract": "Little is known about the status of the mitogen-activating protein kinase pathways in lung cancer. One of the key molecules taking part in these pathways is the product of the c-mos proto-oncogene, which plays an important role in oocyte maturation. In vitro investigations in somatic cells have shown that c-mos expression has opposing effects on the cell cycle, which suggests that this proto-oncogene may represent an important determinant of aberrant cell function (genomic instability and altered kinetics). A recent study suggests that these effects may be p53 dependent. In view of the apparent link between c-mos and p53, we investigated in a series of 56 non-small cell lung carcinomas: a) the status of c-mos; b) its relationship to genomic instability (aneuploidy) and two kinetic parameters of the tumors, proliferation and apoptotic indexes (AI); and c) its association with p53 alterations and their concomitant relationship with the above parameters. We found c-mos overexpression in 27% of the tumors. Expression was higher in stages II/III (34%) than in stage I (17%; P = 0.018). Complete concordance was observed between c-mos overexpression and elevated c-mos mRNA levels. Because c-mos gene amplification was not detected, its deregulated expression may be attributable to increased transcription. Of the c-mos positive [c-mos(P)] cases, 77% were associated with aneuploidy. Sequencing showed two silent mutations and one missense (R--&gt;L) at codon 22, located in a region critical for c-mos stability. In contrast to the findings of some in vitro studies, c-mos(P) tumors had a lower mean AI score than the c-mos negative [c-mos(N)] tumors had, implying that induction of apoptosis may have been defective. Indeed, 86% of the tumors overexpressing c-mos showed p53 alterations. The carcinomas with concomitant alterations of c-mos and p53 [c-mos(P)/p53 positive] had significantly lower AI values (P &lt; 0.001) and were more frequently associated with aneuploidy (P = 0.015) than the c-mos(N)/p53 negative tumors but not the c-mos(N)/p53 positive tumors, which suggests that p53 status is the main determinant of ploidy status and apoptosis in our series. This finding also strengthens the concept that wild-type p53 plays a &quot;safeguard&quot; role in preventing oncogene-mediated activation",

    "Title": "Evidence for the development of p53 mutations after cytotoxic therapy in a neuroblastoma cell line",
    "Abstract": "p53 mutations are rare in neuroblastomas at diagnosis perhaps accounting for their initial response to therapy, but advanced neuroblastoma frequently relapses, and it is possible that p53 mutations develop later. Two neuroblastoma cell lines derived from the same patient before [SKNBE(1n)] and after [SKNBE(2c)] cytotoxic therapy were analyzed for the presence of chromosome 17 and p53 genes by fluorescent in situ hybridization, p53 mutations by DNA sequencing, and p53 function after irradiation by studying the transcription of p53-regulated genes, cell cycle arrest, and induction of apoptosis. The SKNBE(1n) cell line was wild-type for p53, had two p53 genes, two copies of chromosome arm 17p and showed functional p53 after irradiation. The SKNBE(2c) cell line derived from the same patient 5 months later at relapse had loss of an entire chromosome 17, resulting in hemizygosity for the p53 locus on 17p and a missense p53 mutation in exon 5, and p53 was not functional after irradiation. The appearance of a p53 mutation in a cell line derived from a relapsed neuroblastoma suggests that this may be a mechanism of resistance to therapy. If p53 mutations develop frequently in relapsed neuroblastoma, cytotoxic agents more sensitive to mutant p53 might be more effective at relapse",

    "Title": "Cytogenetic analysis of multifocal bladder cancer supports a monoclonal origin and intraepithelial spread of tumor cells",
    "Abstract": "Bladder cancer is often characterized by a multifocal growth pattern. This observation has given rise to the hypothesis of &quot;field cancerization,&quot; predicting a polyclonal origin of multiple tumors rising from an area of independently transformed mucosa cells. On the other hand, genetic studies suggested a monoclonal origin. To address these contradictory hypotheses, we performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on 32 tumors originating from six bladder cystectomy specimens. All tumors derived from the same patient showed a set of 7-13 identical chromosomal aberrations and additional individual alterations. Most striking were the findings of 17p losses in all (32 of 32) tumors of the six cystectomy specimens and 20p gains in all tumors of four bladders, as well as an unexpected high number of chromosomal changes (20.4 alterations per tumor on average). To clarify a possible role of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene on 17p13, we applied immunohistochemistry and sequence analysis on the tumors and additional 52 mucosa samples. Identical TP53 mutations and protein overexpression was found in individual tumors only as well as in mucosa samples from continuous areas. Our results not only provide further evidence for a monoclonal origin of multifocal bladder cancer but also point at intraepithelial migration of tumor cells carrying specific chromosomal aberrations",

    "Title": "p53 and K-ras mutations in lung cancers from former and never-smoking women",
    "Abstract": "Somatic p53 mutations are common in lung cancer. Active cigarette smoking is positively correlated with the total frequency of p53 mutations and G:C to T:A transversions on the nontranscribed (DNA coding) strand. Mutational hotspots within the p53 gene, e.g., codon 157, have been identified for tobacco-related lung cancer, whereas these same mutations are found rarely in other cancers. Such data implicate specific p53 mutations as molecular markers of smoking. Because limited data exist concerning the p53 mutation frequency and spectra in ex-smokers and nonsmokers, we have analyzed p53 and K-ras mutations in 126 lung cancers from a population-based case-control study of nonsmoking (n = 117) or ex-smoking (n = 9) women from Missouri with quantitative assessments of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Mutations in the p53 gene were found in lung cancers from lifetime nonsmokers (19%) and ex-smokers (67%; odds ratio, 9.08; 95% confidence interval, 2.06-39.98). All deletions were found in tumors from patients who were either ex-smokers or nonsmokers exposed to passive smoking. The G:C to A:T transitions (11 of 28; 39%) were the most frequent p53 mutations found and clustered in tumors from lifetime nonsmokers without passive smoke exposure. The incidence of K-ras codon 12 or 13 mutations was 11% (14 of 115 analyzed) with no difference between long-term ex-smokers and nonsmokers. These and other results indicate that p53 mutations occur more commonly in smokers and ex-smokers than in never-smokers. Such comparisons provide additional evidence of genetic damage caused by tobacco smoke during lung carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Age and TP53 mutation frequency in childhood malignant gliomas: results in a multi-institutional cohort",
    "Abstract": "Malignant astrocytoma is one of the most deadly primary central nervous system tumors. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular pathways that lead to the development of these tumors in adults, comparatively little analysis has been done in childhood astrocytomas, which are less common and have a more favorable prognosis. Our previous studies of an institutional cohort of children with malignant gliomas suggested the existence of distinct molecular pathways of tumorigenesis in younger versus older children, based on the finding of a high frequency of TP53 mutations in tumors from children >3 years of age at diagnosis, compared with those from younger children. In the current study, the association between TP53 mutations and age was examined in greater detail using the multi-institutional group of children enrolled in Children's Cancer Group Study 945, the largest cohort of childhood high-grade gliomas analyzed to date. Seventy-seven tumors with centrally reviewed diagnoses of anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme had sufficient archival histopathological material for microdissection-based genotyping. Sections were examined histologically, and topographic targets that contained malignant tissue were isolated by microdissection and subjected to PCR-based amplification and sequencing of TP53 exons 5-8. Twenty-six tumors (33.8%) had mutations in those exons. Mutations were observed in 2 of 17 tumors (11.8%) from children <3 years of age at diagnosis versus 24 of 60 tumors (40%) from older children, a difference that was statistically significant (P = 0.04), in agreement with our previous results. Whereas malignant gliomas in older children have a frequency of mutations comparable to tumors that arise in young adults, those from children <3 years old do not. The association between age and frequency of TP53 mutations among pediatric malignant gliomas indicates the probable existence of two distinct pathways of molecular tumorigenesis in younger versus older children",

    "Title": "Loss of p53 function confers high-level multidrug resistance in neuroblastoma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Neuroblastomas can acquire a sustained high-level drug resistance during chemotherapy and especially myeloablative chemoradiotherapy. p53 mutations are rare in primary neuroblastomas, but a loss of p53 function could play a role in multidrug resistance. We determined p53 function by measuring induction of p21 and/or MDM2 proteins in response to melphalan (L-PAM) in seven L-PAM-sensitive and 11 L-PAM-resistant neuroblastoma cell lines. p53 was functional in seven/seven drug-sensitive but in only 4/11 drug-resistant cell lines (P = 0.01). In four of the seven cell lines lacking p53 function, mutations of p53 were detected by the microarray GeneChip p53 Assay and automated sequencing, whereas six cell lines with functional p53 had no evidence of p53 mutations. All of the cell lines with wild-type (wt) p53 showed a strong transactivation of the p53-HBS/CAT reporter gene, whereas the four cell lines with mutant p53 failed to transactivate p53 HBS/CAT. Overexpression of MDM2 protein (relative to p53 functional lines) was seen in two p53-nonfunctional cell lines with wt p53; one showed genomic amplification of MDM2. Nonfunctional and mutated p53 was detected in a resistant cell line, whereas a sensitive cell line derived from the same patient before treatment had functional and wt p53. Loss of p53 function was selectively achieved by transduction of human papillomavirus 16 E6 (which degrades p53) into two drug-sensitive neuroblastoma cell lines with intact p53, causing high-level drug resistance to L-PAM, carboplatin, and etoposide. These data obtained with neuroblastoma cell lines suggest that the high-level drug resistance observed in some recurrent neuroblastomas is attributable to p53 mutations and/or a loss of p53 function acquired during chemotherapy. If confirmed in patient tumor samples, these data support development of p53-independent therapies for consolidation and/or salvage of recurrent neuroblastomas",

    "Title": "Destabilization of CHK2 by a missense mutation associated with Li- Fraumeni Syndrome",
    "Abstract": "Li Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a multicancer phenotype, most commonly associated with germ-line mutations in TP53. In a kindred with LFS without an inherited TP53 mutation, we have previously reported a truncating mutation (1100delC) in CHK2, encoding a kinase that phosphorylates p53 on Ser(20). Here, we describe a CHK2 missense mutation (R145W) in another LFS family. This mutation destabilizes the encoded protein, reducing its half-life from >120 min to 30 min. This effect is abrogated by treatment of cells with a proteosome inhibitor, suggesting that CHK2(R145W) is targeted through this degradation pathway. Both 1100delC and R145W germ-line mutations in CHK2 are associated with loss of the wild-type allele in the corresponding tumor specimens, and neither tumor harbors a somatic TP53 mutation. Our observations support the functional significance of CHK2 mutations in rare cases of LFS and suggest that such mutations may substitute for inactivation of TP53",

    "Title": "Promoter hypermethylation of the DNA repair gene O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase is associated with the presence of G:C to A:T transition mutations in p53 in human colorectal tumorigenesis",
    "Abstract": "Defects in DNA repair may be responsible for the genesis of mutations in key genes in cancer cells. The tumor suppressor gene p53 is commonly mutated in human cancer by missense point mutations, most of them G:C to A:T transitions. A recognized cause for this type of change is spontaneous deamination of the methylcytosine. However, the persistence of a premutagenic O(6)-methylguanine can also be invoked. This last lesion is removed in the normal cell by the DNA repair enzyme O(6)- methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). In many tumor types, epigenetic silencing of MGMT by promoter hypermethylation has been demonstrated and linked to the appearance of G to A mutations in the K- ras oncogene in colorectal tumors. To study the relevance of defective MGMT function by aberrant methylation in relation to the presence of p53 mutations, we studied 314 colorectal tumors for MGMT promoter hypermethylation and p53 mutational spectrum. Inactivation of MGMT by aberrant methylation was associated with the appearance of G:C to A:T transition mutations at p53 (Fischer's exact test, two-tailed; P = 0.01). Overall, MGMT methylated tumors displayed p53 transition mutations in 43 of 126 (34%) cases, whereas MGMT unmethylated tumors only showed G:C to A:T changes in 37 of 188 (19%) tumors. A more striking association was found in G:C to A:T transitions in non-CpG dinucleotides; 71% (12 of 17) of the total non-CpG transition mutations in p53 were observed in MGMT aberrantly methylated tumors (Fischer's exact test, two-tailed; P = 0.008). Our data suggest that epigenetic silencing of MGMT by promoter hypermethylation may lead to G:C to A:T transition mutations in p53",

    "Title": "Alternative and aberrant messenger RNA splicing of the mdm2 oncogene in invasive breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "mdm2 is part of a complex mechanism that regulates the expression of p53 as well as the function of Rb, p19ARF, and other genes. In humans, mdm2 dysregulation is associated with gene amplification. This study was undertaken to characterize altered mdm2 expression in a cohort of 38 invasive breast cancers and 9 normal breast specimens. Reverse-transcription PCR with primers spanning the entire open reading frame of the mdm2 gene in breast tissue RNA samples generated PCR products of full-length mdm2 (1526 bp) as well as smaller products (653, 281, 254, and 219 bp). Sequence analysis demonstrated that the 653-bp product was an alternatively spliced product (defined as splicing at the exon/intron boundary consensus sites), whereas the 281, 254, and 219 bp mdm2 products were aberrantly spliced products (splicing at sites not considered to be exon/intron boundary sites). Reverse-transcription-PCR with normal breast tissue RNA samples yielded only the 1526-bp product in five samples and the 1526-bp product and the 653-bp product in four samples. The 653-bp alternatively spliced product was expressed in 21% of breast cancers, and the smaller, aberrantly spliced mRNA products (281 bp, 254 bp, and/or 219 bp) were expressed in 16% of breast cancers. The protein products predicted by the alternatively spliced mRNAs and the aberrantly spliced mRNAs lacked either the entire binding domain for p53 or the majority of the binding domain for p53. Immunohistochemical analysis of HER2/neu (c-erbB2), estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, and p53 protein was performed. p53 sequence alterations were identified by mismatch detection and confirmed by p53 oligonucleotide microarray technology. An association was demonstrated between the expression of aberrantly and/or alternatively spliced mdm2 mRNAs and a lack of progesterone receptor. An association was also demonstrated between mdm2 aberrantly and/or alternatively expression products and the presence of p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations. mdm2 is transcribed from two different promoters: one, p53-dependent, and the other, p53-independent. The 5' untranslated region of the transcripts was evaluated to determine the promoter usage in each breast cancer specimen. No correlation was observed between mdm2 splice products and promoter usage. The presence of aberrant expression products of mdm2 in breast cancer specimens was correlated with a shortened overall patient survival. These observations suggest that mdm2 expression is altered in invasive breast cancer and is associated with more aggressive disease",

    "Title": "Expression of p53 protein in T- and natural killer-cell lymphomas is associated with some clinicopathologic entities but rarely related to p53 mutations",
    "Abstract": "To determine if p53 abnormalities could be involved in the pathogenesis of T- or natural killer (NK)-cell lymphomas, we investigated 51 cases of these lymphomas for the expression of p53 and its relationship with p53 gene mutations, the expression of the p21 protein as well as the proliferative and apoptotic indices. Overexpression of p53 was found in 19 cases (37%), whereas mutations of the p53 gene were observed in only 5 of 28 tested cases. The analysis of immunohistochemical data showed some entity-related phenotypic profiles. Anaplastic large cell lymphomas showed a frequent overexpression of p53 (7/8 cases) and p21 (6/8 cases) proteins and rare p53 mutations (1/7 cases), suggesting accumulation of a functional wild type p53 protein able to induce p21 expression. Nodal peripheral T-cell lymphomas unspecified showed relatively frequent overexpression of p53 protein (5/7 cases), infrequent p21 expression (2/7 cases), and rare p53 gene mutations (1/6 cases). In angioimmunoblastic lymphomas, the common phenotype was p53-/p21- (15/17 cases), with only a few scattered p53-positive cells, which, on the basis of double staining results, were mostly Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cells. A p53 gene mutation was only found in 1 case (1/8 cases) of angioimmunoblastic lymphoma, which showed cytologic tumor progression. Mycosis fungoides showed p53 overexpression in 2 of 4 cases, including 1 case with p53 gene mutation and features of cytologic tumor progression. Nasal NK/T lymphomas showed p53 overexpression in 2 of 5 cases, 1 of which had a p53 gene mutation. Finally, all lymphoblastic T-cell lymphomas (5 cases) and gammadelta hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas (3 cases) were negative for expression of p53 and p21 proteins. We conclude that p53 protein overexpression is a common finding in some entities of T- and T/NK-cell lymphomas, whereas a p53 gene mutation is a rare, sporadic, and rather late event associated with tumor progression in some instances. The p53/p21 expression pattern appears to be variable in T- and T/NK-cell lymphoma entities, reinforcing the concept of distinct, entity-related mechanisms of pathogenesis in these tumors",

    "Abstract": "Adenoid cystic carcinoma is an indolent tumour with an unfavorable long- term prognosis. Dedifferentiation of adenoid cystic carcinoma, which is associated with an accelerated clinical course, has recently been described. We report a case with immunohistochemical and molecular workup to elucidate the likely mechanism of dedifferentiation. The patient, a 64-year-old woman, developed dedifferentiated adenoid cystic carcinoma of the submandibular gland ab initio, accompanied by cervical lymph node metastasis. Histologically, the low-grade adenoid cystic carcinoma merged gradually into an extensive dedifferentiated component that was composed of solid sheets and cords of anaplastic tumor cells with focal gland formation. Immunohistochemically, the dedifferentiated component, but not the adenoid cyst carcinoma component, showed strong overexpression of p53 protein and cyclin D1, as well as a higher Ki67 index. Molecular study confirmed the presence of p53 gene mutation selectively in the dedifferentiated component, suggesting a pivotal role of p53 gene alteration in the dedifferentiation process of adenoid cystic carcinoma",

    "Title": "Methylation in the p53 promoter is a supplementary route to breast carcinogenesis: correlation between CpG methylation in the p53 promoter and the mutation of the p53 gene in the progression from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive ductal carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Aberrant methylation in the CpG sites located in the promoter region of several tumor suppressor genes has been reported in various types of cancers. However, the methylation status of the p53 promoter has not been clearly determined and no information is available on its role in breast cancer. The aim of the study was to determine the presence and timing of the methylation of CpG sites in the p53 promoter, in the progression from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive cancer. We also explored the correlation between the CpG methylation of the p53 promoter and p53 mutation during the progression of breast cancer. The corresponding lesions of both the invasive and noninvasive types were microdissected in paraffin-embedded tissue of 26 breast carcinomas. Bisulfite-modified DNA sequencing for methylation status in the p53 promoter was carried out, and double-strand DNA sequencing was performed in the promoter region and exons 4 to 9 of the p53 gene. CpG site methylation in the p53 promoter was detected in three cases (11.5%). Two noninvasive and three invasive lesions harbored CpG methylation in the p53 promoter. Methylations in more than one site were observed in three lesions, all of which contained methylation in two sites. The methylated CpG sites were located near the AP1 and YY-1 binding sites and at the YY-1 binding site. The p53 mutation was not found in the lesions where methylation in p53 promoter region was evident. In 16 cases (61.5%), neither methylation nor p53 mutation was detected. We conclude that the methylation in the p53 promoter region is found in the breast cancer irrespective of the status of invasion, and that the hypermethylation in the p53 promoter region is an alternative pathway to tumorigenesis where there is no p53 gene mutation",

    "Title": "Rb and TP53 pathway alterations in sporadic and NF1-related malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors",
    "Abstract": "SUMMARY: Karyotypic complexities associated with frequent loss or rearrangement of a number of chromosome arms, deletions, and mutations affecting the TP53 region, and molecular alterations of the INK4A gene have been reported in sporadic and/or neurofibromatosis type I (NF1)-related malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). However, no investigations addressing possible different pathogenetic pathways in sporadic and NF1-associated MPNSTs have been reported. This lack is unexpected because, despite similar morphologic and immunophenotypic features, NF1-related cases are, by definition, associated with NF1 gene defects. Thus, we investigated the occurrence of TP53 and p16(INK4A) gene deregulation and the presence of microsatellite alterations at markers located at 17p, 17q, 9p21, 22q, 11q, 1p, or 2q loci in MPNSTs and neurofibromas either related (14 cases) or unrelated (14 cases) to NF1. Our results indicate that, in MPNSTs, p16(INK4A) inactivation almost equally affects both groups. However, TP53 mutations and loss of heterozygosity involving the TP53 locus (43% versus 9%), and p53 wild type overexpression, related or not to mdm2 overexpression (71% versus 25%), seem to mainly be restricted to sporadic MPNSTs. In NF1-associated MPNSTs, our microsatellite results are consistent with the occurrence of somatic inactivation by loss of heterozygosity of the second NF1 allele",

    "Title": "Molecular alterations of Barrett's esophagus on microdissected endoscopic biopsies",
    "Abstract": "Alterations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes play a role in the sequence from Barrett's metaplasia to esophageal adenocarcinoma. The present study aims to ascertain whether molecular abnormalities take place in Barrett's metaplasia and low-grade dysplasia and to correlate them with the histological features of the esophageal mucosa. Forty-one formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded endoscopic esophageal biopsies were classified according to the type of metaplastic changes (noncolumnar fundic and cardial metaplasia; columnar metaplasia, with and without intestinal features). After microdissection samples were examined for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using polymorphic markers on 5q (D5S82), corresponding to APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene, 13q (CA repeat in intron 2 position 14815 to 14998 of the retinoblastoma gene), 17p (D17S513) corresponding to p53 locus, and for p53 mutations. Molecular alterations including LOH, allelic imbalance, and microsatellite instability could be detected in all types of metaplastic changes and sporadically in the squamous epithelium adjacent to the metaplastic tissue. Molecular alterations involving microsatellites D5S82 and the CA repeat inside the retinoblastoma gene were more frequent in nonintestinal metaplasia whereas those involving the p53 locus took place in columnar intestinal metaplasia and in low- grade dysplasia. Clonal changes were demonstrated in different metaplastic areas in three patients. Genetic alterations comprising LOH and microsatellite instability characterize Barrett's mucosa and appear related to the type of metaplastic change. Some of them precede the development of intestinal metaplasia, suggesting that genetic alterations take place earlier than previously thought",

    "Title": "Molecular analysis of the 9p21 locus and p53 genes in Ewing family tumors",
    "Abstract": "SUMMARY: The EWS-ETS rearrangements, and their respective fusion gene products, are specifically associated with histopathologically Ewing family tumors (EFT). These translocations are implicated in generating malignant transformation of EFT, but the presence of additional genetic alterations must be considered in the pathogenesis of such tumors. We analyzed 26 samples (biopsies and/or nude mice xenotransplants) collected from 19 patients with an EFT to determine whether molecular and cytogenetic alterations of the G(1)/S checkpoint genes are implicated in the pathogenesis of EFT. We found inactivating p53 mutations in three (16%) cases, which correlated with a loss of p21(WAF1/Cip1) expression and with a monosomy of chromosome 17 in two cases. Homozygous deletion of the p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF) gene was detected in four (21%) cases, three with codeletion of the p15(INK4B) gene and with chromosome 9 abnormalities. In all of these cases, expression of the implicated genes was absent. Hypermethylation of the p16(INK4A) and p15(INK4B) genes was detected in two (10%) and three (16%) cases, respectively, and was correlated with a low level of gene expression. Neither cyclin D1, nor MDM2 and CDK4 amplification was observed. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with tumors carrying homozygous deletion of the 9p21 locus, or point mutations of the p53 gene, had poorer outcomes than those without these molecular alterations (p = 0.005). In conclusion, 58% (11 of 19) of the analyzed patients showed genetic or epigenetic alterations in either the 9p21 locus or p53 tumor suppressor genes, defining a subgroup of patients with poor clinical outcome. This fact points to an important role of the G(1)/S cell cycle checkpoint dysregulation in the pathogenesis of EFT",

    "Title": "p53 Gene mutation and protein accumulation during neoplastic progression in barrett's esophagus",
    "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to characterize expression and mutation of p53 during the neoplastic progression from Barrett's esophagus to adenocarcinoma and to test the reliability of immunohistochemistry for p53 overexpression as an indicator of p53 mutation in this context. The association of both gene mutation and protein accumulation with clinicopathological findings and survival was also studied. A total of 77 samples from 30 esophagectomy specimens with Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma of patients in longitudinal clinical follow-up were analyzed. Different lesions (intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma) as well as normal squamous-cell esophageal epithelia were sampled from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues by microdissection. Mutations in p53 Exons 5 to 9 were detected by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphisms (PCR-SSCP) and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein was analyzed immunohistochemically from tissue sections adjacent to those used for microdissection. p53 gene mutations were found in 17 and p53 protein accumulation were found in 20 tumor samples. Of the 17 adenocarcinomas with a p53 mutation, 16 stained positive for p53 protein. p53 mutations were detected significantly more frequently in high-grade dysplastic than in low-grade dysplastic lesions (77% versus 29%, P &lt; 0.01). In contrast, nuclear accumulation of p53 was detected in 85% of high-grade and 71% of low-grade dysplastic lesions. In eight cases with p53 mutation, the mutation identified in the tumors was also detected in premalignant lesions, mainly in high-grade dysplasia. In four cases of p53-mutated tumors, clones with different p53 mutations were detected in premalignant lesions. Neither p53 mutations nor p53 protein accumulations were found in metaplastic lesions. In summary, we found that p53 mutations occurred mainly during the transition from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia in the neoplastic progression of Barrett's esophagus but not in the nondysplastic Barrett's mucosa. Mutational analysis of p53 by PCR-SSCP and p53 accumulation by immunohistochemistry were mostly concordant in adenocarcinoma and high-grade dysplastic lesions but frequently discordant in low-grade dysplastic lesions. No correlation between p53 gene mutation or p53 accumulation and clinicopathological findings was observed in this study",

    "Title": "Immunoexpression of ultraviolet photoproducts and p53 mutation analysis in atypical fibroxanthoma and superficial malignant fibrous histiocytoma",
    "Abstract": "p53 mutation is one of the major results of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV photoproducts of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine- pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts (64PPs) also play an important role in skin cancer development. Atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX), which mimics malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) histologically, occurs in the sun- exposed skin of the elderly, and therefore, an association with UV has long been suspected. Eighteen fibrohistiocytic skin lesions comprising AFX (n = 7), storiform-pleomorphic type MFH centered in the subcutis (superficial MFH; S-MFH; n = 4) and benign fibrous histiocytoma (BFH; n = 7) were used for immunohistochemical and molecular analysis. Eight cases of deep MFH (D-MFH) were also analyzed for UV photoproduct expression for the purposes of comparison. Immunohistochemically, the CPD scores of AFX (3.6 +/- 0.4) were significantly higher than those of S-MFH (1.3 +/- 0.8), D-MFH (0.8 +/- 0.5), or BHF (1.4 +/- 0.7); however, the 64PP scores were extremely low in all these tumors (AFX, 0.1 +/- 0.1; S-MFH, 0.0 +/- 0.0; D-MFH, 0.0 +/- 0.0; and BHF, 0.0 +/- 0.0). AFX, S-MFH, and BFH showed immunoexpression for p53 (2/7, 2/4, and 0/7), respectively. p53 mutations were detected in AFX (4/6; 67%) and S-MFH (1/4; 25%), but not in BFH (0/5; 0%) using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism, and all of the mutations in AFX were either C-T transitions or at dipyrimidine sites. In conclusion, AFX and S-MFH are both similar fibrohistocytic lesions; however, AFX has high immunoreactivity for CPDs compared with S-MFH, D- MFH, or BFH. These data suggest that CPDs may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AFX",

    "Title": "p53 Alteration and chromosomal instability in prostatic high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and concurrent carcinoma: analysis by immunohistochemistry, interphase in situ hybridization, and sequencing of laser-captured microdissected specimens",
    "Abstract": "p53 mutation has been shown to be associated with chromosomal instability (CI) in many human dysplastic and neoplastic lesions. However, the precise role of p53 in the pathogenesis of prostate carcinoma (Pca) is unknown. Topographic analysis of p53 alteration using immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 35 archived prostatectomy specimens containing Pca foci; high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (HPIN) foci intermingled with cancer (HPINI) and situated away (HPINA). Specimens from 2 patients were topographically genotyped using laser capture microdissection, PCR amplification, and direct sequencing of p53 exons 5-9. CI was evaluated in the same tissue foci by interphase in situ hybridization (IFISH) using centromere probes for chromosomes 7, 8, and Y. p53 immunoreactivity was found in 20%, 17%, 0, and 0 in Pca, HPINI, HPINA, and benign epithelium, respectively. p53 molecular analysis in the specimens examined confirmed the IHC findings. IFISH revealed numerical chromosomal alterations in keeping with CI in 71% and 25% of p53+ and p53- Pca, respectively (P =.1), 67% and 0 of p53+ and p53- HPIN, respectively (P <.02), and in 27% and 0 of HPINI and HPINA, respectively. We concluded that p53 mutation is an early change in at least a subset of Pca. HPINI foci tend to have higher overall p53 immunoreactivity and CI than HPINA. The presence of p53 mutation in HPIN was associated with the presence of CI as determined by IFISH. Our study also provided additional evidence in support of the concept that HPIN might be the earliest precursor of cancer. Furthermore, our studies identify genomic similarities in HPINI and Pca, implying that carcinoma may arise from progression of certain HPIN foci that most likely harbor p53 mutation and/or more CI",

    "Title": "Losses of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q in the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma. A study of paraffin-embedded sections",
    "Abstract": "Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction-based microsatellite analysis, and p53 sequencing were performed in paraffin-embedded material from 18 oligodendrogliomas and histologically similar astrocytomas. The study was undertaken because of evidence that concurrent loss of both the 1p and 19q chromosome arms is a specific marker for oligodendrogliomas. Of the six lesions with a review diagnosis of oligodendroglioma, all had the predicted loss of 1p and 19q seen by CGH, FISH, and polymerase chain reaction. Other lesions, including some considered oligodendroglioma or mixed glioma by the submitting institution, did not. There were no p53 mutations in any of the six oligodendrogliomas, whereas 5 of the 10 remaining, successfully studied cases did have p53 mutations. The results suggest that CGH and FISH performed on current or archival tissue can aid in classification of infiltrating gliomas such as oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. The results of the p53 studies are consistent with findings of previous investigations that such mutations are less common in oligodendrogliomas than they are in astrocytomas",

    "Abstract": "Alterations in p53 tumour suppressor gene and its expression may be implicated in the pathogenesis of betel- and tobacco-related oral cancer. There is wide regional variation in betel- and tobacco-consuming habits in different parts of the Indian subcontinent. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlations between p53 gene mutations, protein accumulation and serum antibodies in oral precancer and cancer. We analysed 30 potentially malignant oral lesions (leukoplakia) and 30 oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) from northern India because the betel quid-consuming habits are different from those prevalent in other regions of India. p53 mutations were analysed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA and direct sequencing, p53 protein accumulation by immunohistochemical analysis and circulating p53 antibodies by ELISA. p53 gene mutations, analysed within exons 5-9, were observed in five out of 30 (17%) potentially malignant oral lesions and seven out of 30 (23%) oral SCCs. All the mutations were base substitution mutations. Three missense and two nonsense mutations were observed in potentially malignant oral lesions, while six missense and one nonsense mutations were identified in oral SCCs. The probable hot spots for the mutations were identified at codons 126, 136 and 174, which have not been observed thus far. A good correlation was observed between p53 missense mutation, p53 antibodies and p53 protein accumulation in matched potentially malignant and malignant oral lesions. All the potentially malignant and cancerous lesions harbouring missense mutations showed accumulation of p53 protein and the majority of these patients showed circulating p53 antibodies suggesting that serological detection of p53 antibodies may serve as a surrogate marker for p53 alterations in oral lesions",

    "Title": "Loss of MDM2 expression in human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and clinical significance",
    "Abstract": "The transforming potential of the MDM2 oncogene has been attributed to the overproduction of the protein. In order to investigate regulation of MDM2 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, we analysed MDM2 gene amplification, and mRNA and protein expression in tumour specimens from 62 patients, in cell lines, and in normal epithelium adjacent to tumours or obtained from healthy patients. Additionally, TP53-induced MDM2-P2 transcription was evaluated and compared with TP53 status. MDM2 gene amplification and mRNA over- expression is infrequent, 7 and 9%, respectively. The predominant transcript codes for full-length MDM2 protein (90kD) and the level of alternatively spliced forms is not significant. We show that only 47% of tumours exhibit MDM2 immunostaining in more than one third of the neoplastic cells, and thus more than half of the tumours display no or low levels of MDM2 protein. In contrast, MDM2 protein is always detectable in basal and parabasal cells of morphologically normal epithelium outside the invasively growing tumour, as well as in a normal uvula sample. Similarly, the total amount of MDM2 transcripts analysed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is reduced in tumour samples compared to normal tissues, essentially due to a decrease in P2 transcript levels. The relationship between mutated p53 status and low levels of MDM2 found in cell lines is also observed to a certain extent in primary tumour samples. Overall, there is a high frequency of TP53 mutation and under-expression of MDM2 in the head and neck tumours. Moreover, a significant association of decreased MDM2 expression is observed with advanced tumour stage and 3 years survival",

Geneticin treatment was adopted to eliminate contaminating fibroblasts and to enrich tumor cells in the early stage of the culture. The NOS-1 cells showed epithelial morphological features with light and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed their epithelial origin. Overexpression of mutant p53 protein, a p53 point mutation at codon 248 with transition from CGG to TGG, and amplification of the erbB-1 oncogene/epidermal growth factor receptor gene were also observed in NOS-1 cells. The NOS-1 cells formed tumors in nude mice when transplanted subcutaneously into their backs. Further, they were transplantable orthotopically in the tongues of nude mice, and the transplanted tumors in the tongue showed diffuse invasion without forming capsules. The NOS-1 cells were useful for elucidating the mechanism involving p53 inactivation and erbB-1 oncogene amplification, as well as treatment of oral cancer",

    "Abstract": "Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (ADCE) with Barrett's mucosa and adenocarcinoma of the cardia (ADCC) are often reported as a single pathological entity. In this study we have used strict anatomical-pathological criteria to distinguish between these two lesions and we have investigated their differences in TP53 mutations, MDM2 gene amplification, and cytokeratin expression. DNA was extracted from the tumor areas of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections in 26 ADCC and 28 ADCE patients. TP53 mutations were detected by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis and identified by sequencing. MDM2 amplification was assessed by differential polymerase chain reaction. The expression of cytokeratins 4, 7, and 13 was examined by immunohistochemistry. In ADCC, the male to female ratio was 1.8:1, compared to 27:1 in ADCE. Five ADCC patients had a history of other neoplasms, compared to only one ADCE patient. The two types of tumor differed in the prevalence of TP53 mutations (31% in ADCC and 50% in ADCE) and of MDM2 gene amplification (19% in ADCC and 4% in ADCE), and in the pattern of expression of cytokeratin 7 (positive in 100% of ADCE and in 41% of ADCC) and cytokeratin 13 (positive in 81% of ADCE and in 36.5% of ADCC). ADCE and ADCC differ in their clinical characteristics, in the prevalence of TP53 mutations and MDM2 amplifications, and in the patterns of cytokeratin expression. These results support the notion that ADCC and ADCE are distinct pathological entities",

    "Title": "Role of PTCH and p53 genes in early-onset basal cell carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer in the Western world. Ultraviolet (UV) exposure, race, age, gender, and decreased DNA repair capacity are known risk factors for the development of BCC. Of these, UVB irradiation from sunlight is the most significant risk factor. The incidence of sporadic BCC increases in individuals older than age 55, with the greatest incidence reported in individuals who are older than 70, and is rare in individuals who are younger than 30. In this study, we analyzed 24 BCC samples from individuals who had BCC diagnosed by the age of 30. Fifteen single-stranded conformation polymorphism variants in the PTCH gene were identified in 13 BCC samples. Sequence analysis of these single-stranded conformation polymorphism variants revealed 13 single nucleotide changes, one AT insertion, and one 15-bp deletion. Most of these nucleotide changes (nine of 15) were predicted to result in truncated PTCH proteins. Fifteen p53 mutations were also found in 11 of the 24 BCC samples. Thirty-three percent (five of 15) and 60% (nine of 15) of the nucleotide changes in the PTCH and p53 genes, respectively, were UV-specific C--&gt;T and CC--&gt;TT nucleotide changes. Our data demonstrate that the p53 and PTCH genes are both implicated in the development of early-onset BCC. The identification of UV-specific nucleotide changes in both tumor suppressor genes suggests that UV exposure is an important risk factor in early onset of BCC",

    "Title": "p53 Mutations in Nasal Natural Killer/T-Cell Lymphoma from Mexico : Association with Large Cell Morphology and Advanced Disease",
    "Abstract": "Nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma is a unique form of lymphoma highly associated with Epstein-Barr virus, and with a characteristic geographic distribution. Recently, we showed that p53 is overexpressed in a high percentage of nasal NK/T-cell lymphomas. The aim of this study was to analyze the status of the p53 gene, and correlate it with the expression of p53 protein and its downstream target, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, in a series of 25 cases of well-characterized nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma from Mexico. The highly conserved exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and screened for mutations by denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography. Abnormal polymerase chain reaction products detected by denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography and additional selected cases were sequenced. In addition, the incidence of loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus was analyzed in 12 cases. Of the 25 patients, 17 were male and 8 female (M:F ratio, 2.1:1), with a median age of 43 years (range, 21 to 93 years). Morphologically, most of the cases were composed of a mixture of medium-sized cells and large transformed cells (21 cases), and four cases were composed exclusively of large transformed cells. Three different groups determined by p53 gene status and expression of p53 protein were identified: group 1 was p53 +/p53 mutated (five cases, all with p53 missense mutations). Morphologically, three of the five cases were composed of large cells. All five cases revealed overexpression of p53 in the majority of the tumor cells with a mean of 86%. Unexpectedly, three of these cases also showed overexpression of p21. Four of the five patients presented with clinical stage IVB and died with disease. Group 2 was p53+/p53 wild-type (10 cases). Histologically, nine cases were of the mixed type, and one of the large cell type. The percentage of p53 overexpressing cells was lower than in the previous group with a mean of 23%. p21 was positive in 7 of the 10 cases. Six patients in this group presented with clinical stages I to II and four patients with advanced disease (stage III and IV). Five patients are alive 12 to 120 months later (mean, 24 months), three with no evidence of disease. Group 3 was p53-/p53 wild-type (10 cases). All cases showed mixed cell morphology. p21 was positive in 5 of 10 cases. Four patients presented with clinical stage I to II and six patients with advanced disease. Four patients are alive with no evidence of disease 9 to 60 months later (mean, 10 months). Overall, p53 mutations were present in 24% (5 of 21) of the evaluable cases, all of them overexpressing p53 in the majority of tumor cells. Cases with p53 mutations were associated with large cell morphology (P = 0.0162) and presented more often with advanced stage disease. Loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 17p was found only in 2 of the 12 (17%) cases investigated, both cases showed p53 mutations of the remaining allele. P21 overexpression (60% of cases) is frequent in nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma and seems to be independent of p53 gene status. The overexpression of p53 and p21, independent of p53 mutations, although as yet not clear, might be the result of Epstein-Barr virus infection, and warrants further investigation",

    "Title": "Overall survival in aggressive B-cell lymphomas is dependent on the accumulation of alterations in p53, p16, and p27",
    "Abstract": "Different studies have already shown that the isolated inactivation of p21, p16, or p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) is associated with increased growth fraction, tumor progression, or decreased overall survival in cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this study we linked molecular study of the p53 and p16 genes with immunohistochemical analysis of p27 expression in a group of aggressive B-cell lymphomas [large B-cell lymphomas (LBCLs) and Burkitt's lymphomas]. This was done to analyze the relationship between p53 and p16 silencing, p27 anomalous overexpression, and clinical follow-up, testing the hypothesis that the accumulation of CKI alterations could confer to the tumors a higher aggressivity. In a group of 62 patients, p53 inactivation as a result of mutation was observed in 11 cases (18%) and p16 silencing was seen in 27 cases (43.5%) as a result of methylation (20 of 62), 9p21 deletion (7 of 44), or p16 mutation (2 of 62). The simultaneous inactivation of p53 and p16 was detected exclusively in five LBCL cases. Anomalous expression of p27, which has been proven to be associated with the absence of p27/CDK2 complexes and the formation of p27/cyclin D3 complexes where p27 is inactivated, was detected in 19 of 61 cases (31%). Cases characterized by p27 anomalous expression display concurrent inactivation of p21 (provided by p53 mutations) and/or p16 CKIs in 11 of 14 LBCL cases (P = 0.040). When the relationship between the association of inactivated CKIs and overall survival was considered, a significant relationship was found between a lower overall survival probability and an increased number of inactivated CKIs in LBCL cases, with the worst prognosis for the cases displaying concurrent p53, p16, and p27 alterations. This proves that simultaneous inactivation of different tumor suppressor pathways does indeed take place, and that tumor aggressiveness takes advantage of this CKI-concerted silencing. In this same series of data, Burkitt's lymphoma patients seem to behave in a different way than LBCLs, with p53 and p16 alteration being mutually exclusive and the association with p27 anomalous expression not being clinically significant. These facts seem to support that the additive effect of the inactivation of different CKIs could be dependent of the histological type",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in urinary bladder cancer",
    "Abstract": "We have screened for mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene in a series consisting of 189 patients with urinary bladder neoplasms. 82 (44%) neoplasms were lowly malignant (Ta, G1-G2a) and 106 (56%) were highly malignant (G2b-G4 or &gt;/=T1). Only one mutation was in a lowly malignant urinary bladder neoplasm, in total we found p53 mutations in 26 (14%) of the 189 patients. 30% of the samples had loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for one or both of the p53 exogenic (CA)n repeat and the p53 intragenic (AAAAT)n repeat markers. 31 samples (21%) showed LOH but were not mutated, suggesting other mechanisms inactivating p53 than mutations. 4 mutations were found at codon 280 and 2 mutations were found at codon 285, 2 previously reported hot spots for urinary bladder cancer. The study indicate a boundary between G2a and G2b tumours concerning the occurrence of genetic events affecting p53 function; moderately differentiated (G2) urinary bladder neoplasms probably are genetically heterogeneous which supports the suggestion that they should not be grouped together but instead, for example, be categorized as either lowly or highly malignant.

    "Title": "Frequent p53 mutation in brain (fetal)-type glycogen phosphorylase positive foci adjacent to human 'de novo' colorectal carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "'de novo' carcinogenesis has been advocated besides 'adenoma carcinoma sequence' as another dominant pathway leading to colorectal carcinoma. Our recent study has demonstrated that the distribution of brain (fetal)-type glycogen phosphorylase (BGP) positive foci (BGP foci) has a close relationship with the location of 'de novo' carcinoma. The aims of the present study are to investigate genetic alteration in the BGP foci and to characterize them in the 'de novo' carcinogenesis. 17 colorectal carcinomas without any adenoma component expressing both immunoreactive p53 and BGP protein were selected from 96 resected specimens from our previous study. Further investigations to examine the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-labelling index, and the p53 and the codon 12 of K-ras mutation using the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism were performed in the BGP foci, BGP negative mucosa and carcinoma. The BGP foci were observed sporadically in the transitional mucosa adjacent to the carcinoma in all cases. The PCNA labelling index in the BGP foci was significantly higher than that in the BGP negative mucosa (P&lt; 0.001). p53 mutations were observed in 8 carcinomas, but no K-ras mutation was detected. Interestingly, although none of the overexpressions of p53 protein was detected immunohistochemically in the BGP positive foci, the p53 gene frequently (41.2% of the BGP foci tested) mutated in spite of no K-ras mutation. The present study demonstrates potentially premalignant foci in the colorectal transitional mucosa with frequent p53 gene mutation. It is suggested that BGP foci are promising candidates for the further investigation of 'de novo' colorectal carcinogenesis.

    "Title": "Hypoxia in human soft tissue sarcomas: Adverse impact on survival and no association with p53 mutations",
    "Abstract": "Clinical and experimental studies have suggested that tumour hypoxia is associated with poor treatment outcome and that loss of apoptotic potential may play a role in malignant progression of neoplastic cells. The tumour suppressor gene p53 induces apoptosis under certain conditions and microenvironmental tumour hypoxia may select for mutant tumour cells with diminished apoptotic potential due to lack of p53 function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic relevance of oxygenation status for treatment outcome and to compare pre-treatment tumour oxygenation measurements were done in 31 of those by PCR using DNA extracted from paraffin-embaedded sections (n = 2) or frozen biopsies (n = 29). The overall median of the tumour median pO(2)was 19 mmHg (range 1-58 mmHg). Only 6 tumours had functional p53 mutations and no association was found between mutant p53 and tumour hypoxia. Five out of 6 STS with lower histopathological grade were well-oxygenated whereas high-grade STS were both hypoxic and well-oxygenated. At a median follow-up of 74 months, 16 patients were still alive among 28 available for survival analysis. When stratifying into hypoxic and well-oxygenated tumours patients with the most hypoxic tumours has a statistically poorer disease-specific and overall survival at 5 years. In conclusion hypoxia was an indicator for both a poorer disease specific and overall survival in human STS but hypoxic tumours were not characterized by mutations in the p53 gene.

These tumours had more lymph-node metastasis (P = 0.048) and tended to have a poorer survival (P = 0.07). Missense mutations of p53 were detected in 20 (51.3%) patients and had a significantly stronger COX-2 expression than tumours without p53 mutation (P = 0.016).

    "Title": "Pancreatic tumours: molecular pathways implicated in ductal cancer are involved in ampullary but not in exocrine nonductal or endocrine tumorigenesis",
    "Abstract": "Alterations of K- ras, p53, p16 and DPC4/Smad4 characterize pancreatic ductal cancer (PDC). Reports of inactivation of these latter two genes in pancreatic endocrine tumours (PET) suggest that common molecular pathways are involved in the tumorigenesis of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine epithelia. We characterized 112 primary pancreatic tumours for alterations in p16 and DPC4 and immunohistochemical expression of DPC4. The cases included 34 PDC, 10 intraductal papillary-mucinous tumours (IPMT), 6 acinar carcinomas (PAC), 5 solid-pseudopapillary tumours (SPT), 16 ampulla of Vater cancers (AVC) and 41 PET. All tumours were also presently or previously analysed for K- ras and p53 mutations and allelic loss at 9p, 17p and 18q. Alterations in K- ras, p53, p16 and DPC4 were found in 82%, 53%, 38% and 9% of PDC, respectively and in 47%, 60%, 25% and 6% of AVC. Alterations in these genes were virtually absent in PET, PAC or SPT, while in IPMT only K- ras mutations were present (30%). Positive immunostaining confirmed the absence of DPC4 alterations in all IPMT, SPT, PAC and PET, while 47% of PDC and 38% of AVC were immunonegative. These data suggest that pancreatic exocrine and endocrine tumourigenesis involves different genetic targets and that among exocrine pancreatic neoplasms, only ductal and ampullary cancers share common molecular events.

    "Title": "p53 missense but not truncation mutations are associated with low levels of p21(CIP1/WAF1) mRNA expression in primary human sarcomas",
    "Abstract": "Many growth-suppressing signals converge to control the levels of the CDK inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1). Some human cancers exhibit low levels of expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and mutations in p53 have been implicated in this down-regulation. To evaluate whether the presence of p53 mutations was related to the in vivo expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1) mRNA in sarcomas we measured the p21(CIP1/WAF1) mRNA levels for a group of 71 primary bone and soft tissue tumours with known p53 status. As expected, most tumours with p53 mutations expressed low levels of p21(CIP1/WAF1)mRNA. However, we identified a group of tumours with p53 gene mutations that exhibited normal or higher levels of p21(CIP1/WAF1) mRNA. The p53 mutations in the latter group were not the common missense mutations in exons 4-9, but were predominantly nonsense mutations predicted to result in truncation of the p53 protein. The results of this study suggest that different types of p53 mutations can have different effects on the expression of downstream genes such as p21(CIP1/WAF1) in human sarcomas",

    "Title": "TP53 mutations, amplification of P63 and expression of cell cycle proteins in squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus from a low incidence area in Western Europe",
    "Abstract": "In Europe, high incidence rates of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCCE) are observed in western France (Normandy and Brittany) and in north-eastern Italy. Analysis of TP53 mutations in tumours from these regions has shown a high prevalence of mutations at A:T basepairs that may result from DNA damage caused by specific mutagens. However, the spectrum of TP53 mutations in regions of low incidence is unknown. We report here TP53 mutation analysis in 33 SCCE collected in Lyon, an area of low incidence. These tumours were also examined for MDM2 and P63 amplification, and for expression of p16(INK4a/CDKN2a), cyclin E, p27(Kipl)and Cox2. TP53 mutations were detected in 36% of the cases (12/33). In contrast with regions of high incidence, the mutation spectrum did not show a high prevalence of mutations at A:T base pairs. P63 was amplified in 5/32 cases tested (15.5%). No amplification of MDM2 was found. Expression studies revealed frequent loss of p16(INK4a/CDKN2a)(46%) and p27(Kipl)(25%) expression, and frequent overexpression of Cyclin E (70%) and Cox2 (42%). Overall, these results indicate that in Europe, SCCE from areas of high and low incidence present a similar pattern of molecular alterations but differ by the type of TP53 mutations",

    "Abstract": "To investigate the etiology of leiomyosarcoma, we examined abnormalities of p53 and its regulation in 13 cases of leiomyosarcoma using fresh tumor specimens. We estimated p53 and MDM2 mRNA level and MDM2 gene amplification using a real-time semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based on the TaqMan fluorescence method. We also used immunohistochemistry (IHC) for p53 and MDM2 protein overexpression, polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing to detect p53 mutation. Eight of the 13 cases (62%) showed an overexpression of p53 protein on IHC and eight of 13 cases (62%) had p53 gene point mutations. Five of the 13 cases (38%) showed positive staining for MDM2 protein and only one case (7.7%) demonstrated MDM2 gene amplification. The relative p53 mRNA level of the tumors compared with normal tissue ranged from 1.14 to 12.19 arbitrary units (AU), and the MDM2 mRNA level ranged from 1.06 to 17.17 AU. The mRNA level in the p53-positive cases was higher than in the negative cases (positive: 7.70 AU on average; negative: 3.38 AU on average; P=0.0344). However, there was no significant correlation between the MDM2 mRNA level and other factors, such as p53 IHC, p53 mutation status, p53 mRNA level and MDM2 IHC. Our results indicate that p53 abnormalities are major events and that an increasing level of p53 mRNA is associated with an overexpression of p53 protein in leiomyosarcoma and they may play an important role in the tumorigenesis in this tumor",

    "Abstract": "Adenoma and dysplasia in the gallbladder (GB) have been reported as precancerous lesions, but the genetic evidence of this is not clearly defined. The purpose of this study was to analyze the frequencies of K- ras, p53, and p16 gene mutations, of microsatellite instability (MI) and of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in GB cancer, dysplasia, and adenoma. Tissues from 15 GB cancers, five dysplasias around cancerous tumors, and three adenomas were collected prospectively. The mutation rates of K-ras, p53, and p16 were 20.0, 35.7, and 30.7%, respectively, in GB cancers. However, no mutations were found in dysplasia or adenoma. Reduced staining for p16 was seen in 23% of carcinomas. All of the GB carcinomas and four out of five (80%) of the dysplasias showed LOH in a minimum of one locus, but one out of three (33%) cases of adenoma displayed LOH in only one locus. All of the loci of LOH in the dysplasias, except one, showed the same patterns of allelic loss as the adjacent carcinomas. Only one dysplasia showed multiple MI. In conclusion, multiple LOH may be associated with the development of dysplasia and the malignant transformation of GB carcinoma. Gene alterations of K-ras, p53, and p16 are important steps in the malignant changes of dysplasia. However, MI seems to have only a limited role in GB cancer development",

In this report, we describe a 13-year-old boy with xeroderma pigmentosum presenting with squamous-cell carcinoma and melanoma arising at the same site on the nose. Histopathologically, the melanoma component of the lesion was located mainly eccentrically to the squamous-cell carcinoma component. Immunohistochemical stains confirmed the histopathologic findings. Mutations for p53 assessed using single-strand conformation polymorphism, and sequencing analysis revealed a CC-to-TT transition at codon 159 of the p53 gene in the squamous-cell component but not in the melanoma component. This finding suggests a possible role for UV in the pathogenesis of at least the squamous-cell component of the tumor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a collision tumor comprising squamous-cell carcinoma and melanoma arising in childhood",

    "Abstract": "Background: The cyclin dependent kinase p21(waf1) plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell cycle. The family of p53 proteins has the ability to induce p21(waf1), whereas p16(INK4a) modulates post-transcriptionally the expression of p21(waf1). Methods: Total 36 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and 24 paired adjacent liver tissues were evaluated for the following: (1) expression of p21(waf1) and p16(INK4a); (2) that of p21(waf1), p73 and p63 mRNAs; (3) genomic mutations and the loss of heterozygosity of p73 and p53; and (4) frequency of methylation in the 5'CpG promoter region of p16(INK4a). Results: In HCCs compared with the adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues, the expression of p21(waf1) and p16(INK4a) was reduced. Indeed, p21(waf1) was not detected in 36% (8/22) of HCCs in spite of the presence of p21(waf1) mRNA: among them, mutations of p53 gene were found in 50%, whereas a lack of p16(INK4a) expression in all of them. p21(waf1) and p16(INK4a) were reduced in proportion to the degree of methylation in p16(INK4a) gene. p73 did not mutated, and p63 did not expressed in HCCs. Conclusion: Methylation status of p16(INK4a) gene will play a part for reducing constitutive expression of p16(INK4a) and of p21(waf1) coordinately in HCCs",

    "Title": "p53 expression in Wilms' tumor: a possible role as prognostic factor",
    "Abstract": "Although a correlation between anaplasia and mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene has been found in Wilms' tumor (WT) a prognostic significance of p53 in WT remains largely unresolved. The goal of this study was to obtain a better understanding of the role of p53 expression in WT. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 21 patients treated in our clinic between 1984 and 1996. Eight patients presented with stage I, six with stage II, two with stage III, four with stage IV and one patient with stage V disease. According to the presence of anaplasia, four cases were categorized as of unfavorable histology based on the criteria of the National Wilms' Tumor Study Group. Seven out of 21 WTs were positive for p53. One out of the eight patients with stage I and one out of the six patients with stage II disease scored positive for p53 as were 2/2 patients with stage III and 3/4 patients with stage IV disease. Four tumors scored positive for anaplasia (one stage I, one stage II and two stage IV disease) and all four belonged to the p53 positive group. Three of these patients died of progressive disease. Immunopositivity in general was focal in the blastemal and epithelial parts of the tumors, with differences in intensity of staining ranging from moderate to strong. Positivity in the stromal components was restricted to single cells. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlations of p53 expression to anaplasia and to survival, respectively. The association of p53 expression to tumor stage was of borderline significance. To support immunohistochemistry, we performed PCR/SSCP and DNA sequence analyses on two cases, one whose immunopositivity suggested a mutated p53, and another case which was immunonegative. A CGG --> TGG base change in codon 282 of exon 8 was found in the immunopositive tumor. In conclusion, p53 may be of prognostic relevance for poor outcome being present in close association with unfavorable histology of WTs",

    "Abstract": "Using a microdissection technique, the contribution of the p53 mutation to tumorigenesis and prognosis in each histological subtype of the intracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) was evaluated. Nineteen patients had primary intracranial GCTs, including 4 germinomas (GEs), 4 teratomas (TEs), 1 mixed tumor of GE and TE, and 10 mixed GCTs containing non-germinomatous malignant germ cell tumors (NG-MGCTs). After microdissection of specific subtypes, genomic DNA was screened for mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene, using the dideoxyfingerprinting (ddF) followed by direct DNA sequencing. The direct sequencing revealed a total of six mutations in PCR products derived from the five cases (26%) which showed mobility shifts in ddF. Among the six mutations detected, four were missense mutations and two were silent. Missense mutations of the p53 gene tended to occur more frequently in the NG-MGCT component than in the GE or TE components (3/15 vs. 1/12 vs. 0/13). The incidence of missense mutations was not different between the survivors (3/13) and the deceased (1/6). This study suggests the possible role of the p53 gene in the tumori-genesis of NG-MGCT. However, p53 gene mutation did not correlate with the prognosis of NG-MGCT",

    "Title": "Serum anti-p53 in relation to mutations across the entire translated p53 gene in colorectal carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Previous reports have claimed that antibodies to mutated p53 protein indicate poor outcome in malignant disease. The mechanism behind this highly specific process is unclear, although it has been claimed that certain DNA alterations are prone to induction of immune response, since wild-type p53 is almost never immunogenic. The aim of the present analysis was to evaluate whether the presence of anti-p53 was statistically significantly related to any certain DNA alterations in the entirely expressed p53 gene in primary tumors of colorectal cancer. P53 serum antibodies were determined by an enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). P53 antibodies were detected in serum of 24 of 88 patients (27%). Twenty-two of 24 (92%) sero-positive patients had mutations in their p53 gene while only 22 of 64 (34%) sero-negative patients had p53 mutations (p<0.01). Mutations were mainly missense with a trend to significantly higher frequency of deletions in sero- negative patients compared to sero-positive subjects (8/25, 32% and 2/22, 9% respectively, p<0.08). Mutations in sero-positive patients were mainly located in exon 5 and 7 and within conserved regions (17 of 22 mutations). In sero-negative patients missense mutations were usually located in exon 5, 7 and 8 being also most frequently located within conserved regions. Most of the p53 deletions in sero-negative patients were however located outside conserved regions (seven of eight deletions). There was no statistical difference between sero-positive and negative patients concerning the spectrum of mutations along the expressed gene. Our study demonstrates that p53 antibodies are usually related to p53 gene mutations but a mutational event is not sufficient to elicit self-immunization. Cellular protein binding to p53 or individual differences of major histocompatibility complex based presentation of p53 protein sequences by immune cells is therefore the most likely explanation between sero-negative and sero-positive patients",

    "Title": "Improving the detection of p53 mutations in breast cancer by use of the FASAY, a functional assay",
    "Abstract": "The aim of this investigation was to examine the ability of the yeast-based functional assay, the functional analysis for the separation of alleles in yeast (FASAY), to detect p53 mutations in breast cancers when compared with immunohistochemistry and automated sequencing of the whole p53 gene (exons 1-11). To achieve this, all three methods were carried out on a cohort of aggressive breast tumors. In those tumors, in which the FASAY analysis indicated the presence of a mutation, cDNA was extracted from red yeast colonies and was sequenced to identify the base change in the p53 gene. The FASAY detected all 24 mutations found in the series of 48 tumors, whereas initial automated sequencing of genomic DNA detected 18/24 mutations. A second round of automated sequencing carried out using an independent source of genomic DNA detected mutations in 3 of the 6 tumors that originally appeared to lack a mutation in genomic DNA. All but 1 of the mutations originally missed by sequencing of genomic DNA were point mutations. Five mutations in this series (21%) were outside the commonly investigated exons 5-8, reinforcing the need to extend sequencing beyond this region. Of 24 tumors, 14 had strong immunohistochemical staining, and all 14 had p53 mutations; the majority of mutations missed by immunohistochemistry produced a truncated protein. Strong staining was not seen in tumors lacking a p53 mutation. The FASAY proved to be a rapid, reliable, and effective method for identifying those breast tumors harboring p53 mutations",

    "Title": "Establishment and characterization of a novel malignant astrocytoma cell line derived from a tumor removed in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1",
    "Abstract": "OBJECT: Patients with neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) have a predisposition to development of a variety of benign and malignant tumors including neurofibromas, astrocytomas, pheochromocytomas, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. The availability of an astrocytoma cell line derived from NF1 would be useful in studies in which sporadic astrocytomas could be compared with NF1-derived astrocytomas. In this article the authors describe a novel astrocytoma cell line, TM-31, that they established from a tumor removed in a 42-year-old woman with NF1. METHODS: The TM-31 cell line was prepared from a surgical specimen of malignant astrocytoma and was serially subcultured over 250 times throughout a 6-year period without showing any sign of cell senescence. Immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated that TM-31 cells are negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein but positive for vimentin and S-100 protein. The TM-31 cells display little neurofibromin expression when subjected to immunoblotting, indicating that there is an NF1 gene mutation. Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis revealed that TM-31 cells harbor a p53 point mutation in exon 7, codon 238. Chemosensitivity testing of TM-31 cells revealed a resistance to 1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea, although they are sensitive to cisplatin and etoposide. In addition, TM-31 cells displayed no morphological differentiation after all-transretinoic acid and dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate treatments. Pharmacological inhibition of farnesyltransferase of the Ras oncoprotein led to decreased proliferative activity and inhibition of anchorage-independent growth of TM-31 cells in soft agar. CONCLUSIONS: The TM-31 cell line is an immortalized astrocytoma cell line derived from a tumor obtained in a patient with NF1. Ras activation may be the major event of proliferative activity and of the transformed phenotype of TM-31 cells, and the farnesyltransferase inhibitor may be potentially important as a novel antiproliferative therapy for NF1-derived astrocytomas",

    "Title": "Malignant transformation of a gangliocytoma/ganglioglioma into a glioblastoma multiforme: a molecular genetic analysis. Case report",
    "Abstract": "A gangliocytoma/ganglioglioma with no atypical or malignant features was subtotally resected from the right temporal lobe of a 16-year-old woman. A second resection was performed 8 years later to treat a locally recurrent lesion with increased cellularity that was diagnosed as a World Health Organization Grade II ganglioglioma on the basis of neuropathological examination. Molecular analysis of the recurrent tumor revealed a TP53 gene mutation, but no amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Radiotherapy (60 Gy) was administered after the second resection. The patient returned 1 year later with a second focal recurrence. The specimen obtained during the third resection of tumor exhibited exclusively astrocytic differentiation, cellular pleomorphism with multinucleated cells, high mitotic activity, and endothelial proliferation. Therefore, the tumor was diagnosed to be a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Molecular analysis of tumor DNA from the second recurrent tumor demonstrated the presence of the TP53 mutation, which previously had been observed in the first recurrent tumor, but again no evidence of EGFR amplification. Findings demonstrate that the presence of TP53 mutation in progressed gangliogliomas should be interpreted as a progression-associated mutation rather than a consequence of treatment. This is the first report to indicate that the molecular pathways of gangliocytomas/gangliogliomas progressing to become GBMs may parallel those of diffuse astrocytomas progressing to become GBMs",

    "Title": "Low frequency of p53 gene mutations in breast cancers of Japanese-American women",
    "Abstract": "Differences in frequencies and patterns of somatic p53 gene mutations among racially and geographically diverse populations presumably reflect exposure to different mutagens or different responses to certain mutagens. On emigration to the United States, Japanese women experience, over several generations, a four- to fivefold increase in the incidence of breast cancer. To determine whether this increased incidence is associated with a change in the frequency and/or type of p53 mutation in their tumors, we examined paraffin-embedded samples of primary breast cancers from Japanese-American women in Los Angeles County, CA. Mutations in exons 5-9 and adjacent intronic regions of the p53 gene were identified and confirmed by direct sequencing. Seven mutations, including 5 missense, were detected in 44 primary breast carcinomas, a frequency of 16%. There were six transitions and one transversion. As expected, overexpression of p53 protein, detected by immunohistochemistry, occurred in tumors with missense mutations; tumors with nonsense or splice junction mutations had no detectable p53 protein. The frequency of p53 gene mutations showed no increase over that previously found in breast cancers of native Japanese women. The increased incidence of breast cancer in Japanese-American women is likely to be multifactorial in nature and warrants further studies",

    "Abstract": "Most p53 mutations occur in the central part of the p53 gene that codes for the DNA-binding domain. Missense mutations are prevalent. However, 10-25% of all mutations occur outside exons 5-8 and include a prevalence of frameshift, nonsense and splice site mutations. Functional analysis of p53 transactivation ability in yeast (FASAY) was used to screen for p53 mutations in tumors and a mutant p53 protein retaining partial activity was identified. We characterized this somatic p53 mutation in codon 337: transition C-->T, changing codon CGC to TGC and causing substitution of arginine for cysteine in exon 10, which codes for the tetramerization domain of p53. We detected high accumulation of this mutant p53 protein within the tumor tissue and found that it cannot be immunoprecipitated by either a wild-type p53- specific antibody (PAb1620) or by a mutant p53-specific antibody (PAb240). We confirmed the somatic origin of the mutation by analysis of p53 status in peripheral leukocytes",

    "Abstract": "Epithelial differentiation in glioblastomas (GBM) may be associated with circumscribed growth and focal keratin expression resembling carcinoma metastasis. Therefore these rare lesions can pose a diagnostic problem suggesting coincidental occurrence of two separate neoplasms. However molecular analysis should succeed in establishing a common origin of seemingly unrelated tumor samples. Five GBMs exhibiting epithelial differentiation were microdissected and analyzed for mutations in the TP53 gene. SSCP analysis of exons 5-8 was followed by direct sequencing of aberrantly migrating fragments. TP53 mutations were identified in tumors from two of five patients. A G--&gt;T transversion in codon 176 was detected in a tumor, initially diagnosed as metastases of unknown origin, however, a later autopsy revealed GBM. In this lesion, the mutation was observed in both, areas of astrocytic differentiation and areas of epithelial differentiation. One tumor diagnosed as GBM with epithelial differentiation carried C--&gt;T transition in codon 211 in both, areas of astrocytic and epithelial differentiation. Thus, molecular analysis proved clonality in two GBMs with epithelial differentiation, thereby excluding a collision tumor. The present data support the concept of clonal origin of these morphologically heterogeneous lesions",

    "Title": "Determination of microsatellite instability, p53 and K-RAS mutations in hepatic metastases from patients with colorectal cancer: relationship with response to 5-fluorouracil and survival",
    "Abstract": "In vitro and clinical studies have suggested that high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H) phenotype, p53 and K-ras mutations might influence the response to chemotherapy in a variety of tumors, including primary colorectal cancers (CRC). Unresectable hepatic metastases from CRC are commonly treated with 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and folinic acid. Since several new active drugs are now used for treating CRC, molecular determinants predictive to response to 5FU would thus be crucial for optimizing indications of chemotherapy to those patients. MSI-H phenotype, p53 and K-ras status were characterized in a prospective study of 56 patients with CRC metastatic to the liver and treated with 5FU-based chemotherapy. The objective response rate after a 3-month treatment was 32.1%. The prevalence of p53 mutations, K-ras mutations and MSI-H phenotype was 62.5%, 30.3% and 1.8%, respectively. No significant association was found between response to chemotherapy and p53 mutations (78% mutated tumors in responders vs. 55% in nonresponders; p = 0.10) and K-ras mutations (39% mutated tumors in responders vs. 26% in nonresponders; p = 0.34). Survival was longer for patients with p53-mutated metastases than for patients with unresected wild-type p53 metastases (median survival 15 months vs. 17 months; p = 0.06). The determination of the MSI-H phenotype, p53 and K-ras status in hepatic metastases from CRC does not discriminate a group of patients that should preferentially benefit from 5FU-based chemotherapy. The prognosis of patients with treated liver metastases is better when p53 is mutated. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc",

    "Title": "p53 Mutations are present in colorectal cancer with cytoplasmic p53 accumulation",
    "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown that nuclear p53 over-expression is an indicator of p53 mutations whereas cytoplasmic p53 accumulation is related to wild-type p53 in several kinds of tumors. Cytoplasmic p53 accumulation has been demonstrated to be an independent prognostic factor in colorectal adenocarcinomas. The purpose was to examine whether mutations occur in cases with p53 accumulated in the cytoplasm and whether there are any differences in the frequency and characteristics of p53 mutations in different staining patterns. In the present study, we identified p53 mutations using PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing in 75 primary colorectal adenocarcinomas with different staining patterns (negative, nucleus, cytoplasm, nucleus and cytoplasm). The results show that the frequency and nature of mutations in tumors with cytoplasmic p53 accumulation were similar to those with nuclear p53 expression. However, the tumors with accumulation in both the nucleus and cytoplasm demonstrated a higher mutation rate. We suppose that the role of cytoplasmic p53 accumulation in predicting prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer may be dependent on both mutational and non-mutational mechanisms.

    "Title": "Mutations of p53 gene in human colorectal cancer: distinct frameshifts among populations",
    "Abstract": "We analyzed 57 p53 gene mutations in 181 colorectal cancer patients in Taiwan and compiled data on 475 independent p53 mutations in 1,156 primary colorectal cancer patients worldwide between 1992 to 1998. Transitions at the CpG sites were observed in 31 (54%) and 232 cases (49%), respectively. Frameshift mutations occurring within exons were observed in 11 (20%) and 50 cases (10%), respectively. Among the various populations studied, colorectal cancer in Taiwan had the lowest p53 mutation rate (31%), highest frequency (20%) of frameshift mutations and the second lowest rate (13%) of transversion mutation. Based on their relation to the base runs, the 61 frameshift mutations could be grouped into 4 subclasses. After corrections were made for differences in the base number in a run, the relative mutational frequency at a base run was found to be 9- to 47-fold over that in the no-run residues. The p53 frameshift mutational spectrum found in the cases in Taiwan, with respect to hotspot sequence, was significantly different from those in the selected database (p = 0.008). These data support that the patterns of high frequency of transitions at CpG sites and low frequency of transversions in base substitutions in the p53 gene are similar regardless of patient origin. However, these data also illustrate that frameshift mutations in the p53 gene in colorectal cancer patients are sequence dependent and are distinct among populations. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc",

    "Abstract": "We assessed the possible association between CagA+ Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric carcinogenesis in gastric cancer patients. Gastric biopsy specimens were obtained from 64 patients with gastric cancer and were histologically classified into intestinal and diffuse types. H. pylori infection was determined by cultivation, flaA-PCR and serum antibody against CagA. p53, BAX and transforming growth factor-beta-RII (TGFbeta-RII) gene mutations were analyzed by PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing. Intestinal and diffuse types of cancer were detected in 45 and 19 patients, respectively. H. pylori infection was found in 55 (85.9%) of 64 patients. There was no significant difference in H. pylori positivity between intestinal and diffuse types. However, the CagA antibody was positive in 15 (78.9%) of 19 patients with the diffuse type and in 22 (48.9%) of 45 patients with the intestinal type (p = 0.030). Among the 55 H. pylori-positive cases, 11 (29.7%) of the 37 patients in the CagA+ group were found to have p53 alterations, compared with 2 (11.1%) in the 18 CagA- group (p = 0.182). Moreover, among the 64 gastric cancer patients, p53 alterations were more frequently found in the CagA+ group (29.7%) than in the H. pylori-positive CagA- and H. pylori-negative groups (7.4%; p = 0.033). BAX gene mutations were found in 19 (29.7%) of 64 patients and there was no relationship among CagA seropositivity, cancer stages and histopathological phenotypes. In contrast, the TGFbeta-RII gene mutation was only detected in one CagA- patient.

    "Title": "TP53 gene mutations in Hodgkin lymphoma are infrequent and not associated with absence of Epstein-Barr virus",
    "Abstract": "Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells, the neoplastic cells of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) have clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. The presence of somatic mutations suggests a germinal center origin, whereas the presence of crippling mutations suggests rescue of RS precursors from apoptosis by a transforming event. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which can be detected in 30-50% of HL cases, probably plays a role in this transforming event. The frequent presence of p53 protein expression in RS cells also suggests a role of the TP53 gene in this escape from apoptosis. Although mutations of the TP53 gene occur infrequently in RS cells, it has been suggested that in EBV-negative cases this gene mutation may be fundamental for the inhibition of apoptosis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that there is an inverse correlation between the presence of TP53 gene mutations and the presence of EBV. In 21 of 67 cases EBV encoded small RNA (EBER)1-2 mRNAs were detected. Immunostaining for p53 protein revealed positivity in all 67 cases with variable percentages of positive cells and staining intensity. Screening for mutations in exons 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the TP53 gene in single RS cells obtained by laser microdissection from 26 HL specimens and 4 HL-derived cell lines revealed mutations in 2 of 15 EBV-positive cases and in 1 of 11 EBV-negative cases. Our results confirm the presence of infrequent (11.5%) TP53 gene mutations in HL and suggest that mutations of the TP53 gene are not correlated to the absence of EBV",

    "Title": "Heterogeneous distribution of P53 immunoreactivity in human lung adenocarcinoma correlates with MDM2 protein expression, rather than with P53 gene mutation",
    "Abstract": "Although the tumor suppressor p53 protein (P53) immunoreactivity and its gene (p53) mutation were reported to be significant prognostic indicators for human lung adenocarcinomas, little is known regarding the relationship between the heterogeneous distribution of P53 and its genetic status in each tumor focus and the clinicopathological significance. To determine how P53 is heterogeneously stabilized in patients, we compared P53 expression to both the p53 allelic mutation in exon 2 approximately 9 by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism using microdissected DNA fractions, and the immunohistochemical MDM2 expression. Of the 48 positive to P53 in 118 lung adenocarcinomas examined, 10 with heterogeneous P53 expression were closely examined. The higher P53 expression foci in 7 of 10 cases were less differentiated, histologically in respective cases, and were frequently associated with fibrous stroma. Two had genetic mutations in exon 7 of the p53 gene in both the high and low P53 expression foci of cancer tissue indicating no apparent correlation between heterogeneous P53 expression and the occurrence of gene mutation. Immunohistochemical expression of MDM2 was significantly lower in high P53 expression areas (p &lt; 0.05, the mean labeling indices of high and low P53 expression areas being 4.2 +/- 5.4% and 13.6 +/- 12.2%, respectively). In addition, among all the 118 cases examined, MDM2 expression was significantly suppressed in cases of p53 gene mutation, simultaneously with P53 overexpression, as compared with cases without both the p53 mutation and expression (p &lt; 0.001). These findings suggest that the heterogeneous stabilization of P53 in human lung adenocarcinomas could be partly due to suppressed MDM2 expression. The overexpression of non-mutated P53 may afford a protective mechanism in human lung adenocarcinomas",

    "Abstract": "Synchronous and metachronous tumors are frequently observed in the urinary tract and may be explained by the concept of 'field cancerization,' i.e., exposure to carcinogens leading to the independent transformation of many urothelial cells resulting in oncogenetically unrelated tumors. Increasing evidence, however, supports the concept of clonality, i.e., the progeny of a single transformed cell spreads through the urinary system resulting in genetically related tumors. The aim of our study was to investigate the putative clonal origin of invasive urothelial cell carcinomas (UCCs) of the bladder from a prior superficial tumor. We selected 6 patients (5 males and 1 female) with superficial and subsequent invasive UCC tumors. All patients were previously diagnosed with a p53 mutation in their invasive tumor. At least 1 superficial and 1 invasive tumor of the same patient were analyzed for mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene by PCR-SSCP and, in case of a band shift, followed by direct sequencing. In all patients the same p53 mutation was found in the superficial and subsequent invasive tumor(s). All tumors arose from the same progenitor cell. These results support the concept of a clonal origin of superficial and metachronous invasive bladder UCCs",

    "Abstract": "Irradiation to the head is associated with a significantly increased incidence of meningiomas. Radiation-induced meningiomas morphologically resemble their sporadically arising counterparts; however, they frequently exhibit a more malignant phenotype. Several genes have been shown to carry mutations in meningiomas, with the NF2 gene being most frequently affected. To examine whether the NF2 gene also plays a role in the development of radiation-induced meningiomas, we compiled a series of meningiomas from 25 patients with a history of previous cranial radiation. This series was compared with 21 atypical WHO grade II meningiomas and 15 anaplastic WHO grade III meningiomas, all from patients without a history of prior irradiation. NF2 mutations occurred significantly more often in sporadic atypical and anaplastic than in radiation-induced meningiomas (p < 0.02). In addition, all meningiomas were examined for mutations in the PTEN, TP53, HRAS, KRAS and NRAS genes. Two mutations in the TP53 gene in a sporadic and a radiation- induced tumor were detected. PTEN mutations were observed in 1 anaplastic and 1 radiation-induced meningioma. No structural alterations were seen in the RAS genes. Our data suggest that, while there is a certain overlap in the mutational spectrum, NF2 mutations may not play such a prominent role in the pathogenesis of radiation- induced compared to sporadic meningiomas",

    "Abstract": "Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is one of the most important mechanisms for inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes. Studies of LOH in patients with cervical carcinoma have reported a high frequency of LOH on 3p21.3, 6p21.2, 17p13.1, and 18q21.2. Our study explored whether p53 status, human papilloma virus (HPV), and LOH on chromosome 3p21.3, 6p21.2, 17p13.1, and 18q21.2 are associated with treatment outcome in 65 patients with cervical cancer after radiotherapy. Tumors and normal DNA were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for genetic losses at 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci. The presence of HPV and its type were analyzed by PCR-based assay using the consensus primers for E6, E7, and L1 region. Mutations of the p53 gene were identified by a single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Chromosomes 3p21.3, 6p21.2, 17p13.1, and 18q21.2 were involved in the LOH in 23.1%, 41.5%%, 33.8%, and 23.1% of the tumors in our study, respectively. HPV-positive tumors were found in 73.8% of the patients and p53 mutation in 10.8%. The patients with LOH on chromosome 6p21.2 and 18q21.2 survived significantly shorter compared with those without LOH on chromosome 6p21.2 and 18q21.2 in both the overall survival (P = 0.006 and P = 0.007) and the disease-free survival (P = 0.005 and P = 0.008). The HPV- negative patients survived significantly shorter compared with the HPV- positive patients in both the overall survival (P = 0.01) and the disease-free survival (P = 0.04). According to multivariate analysis, HPV status (P = 0.0004, P = 0.01), LOH on 6p21.2 (P = 0.006, P = 0.02), and LOH on 18q21.2 (in both P = 0.01) is a significant predictor of both overall and disease-free survival time. The results of our study suggest that absence of HPV infection, LOH on 6p21.2, and LOH on 18q21.2 are the most important determinants of outcome of patients with cervical carcinoma after radiotherapy",

    "Title": "A single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3'untranslated region of the CDKN2A gene is common in sporadic primary melanomas but mutations in the CDKN2B, CDKN2C, CDK4 and p53 genes are rare",
    "Abstract": "In this report we present the results of mutational analysis of the CDKN2B, CDKN2C, CDK4, p53 genes and 5'UTR of the CDKN2A gene in a set of 44 sporadic primary melanomas, which had been earlier analysed for mutations in the CDKN2A (p16/p14(ARF)) gene. No tumour-associated mutations were detected except in 1 melanoma where we found a CC>T* deletion-mutation in the codon 151-152 (exon 5) of the p53 gene. On the basis of our preliminary results, we did extended genotyping of the 500 C>G and 540 C>T polymorphisms in the 3'UTR of the CDKN2A gene in 229 melanoma cases and 235 controls. The T-allele frequency (for 540 C>T polymorphism) in melanomas was significantly higher than in controls (0.14 vs. 0.08; chi(2) = 5.95, p = 0.01; OR = 1.71, 95%CI = 1.11-2.66). The heterozygote frequency for this polymorphism was 0.26 (59/229) in melanomas compared to 0.13 (30/235) in healthy controls (chi(2) = 11.4; p = 0.0007; OR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.40-3.92). The frequency of the 500 C>G polymorphism in the 3'UTR in the CDKN2A gene was not significantly higher in melanomas compared to healthy controls. The 500 C>G polymorphism, however, was in linkage disequilibrium with approximately 50 kb apart the C>A intronic polymorphism in the CDKN2B gene (determined in 44 melanomas and 90 controls; Fisher exact test, p<0.0001). Finally, the sequence analysis of genomic DNA isolated from T cell lymphocytes of healthy individuals exhibited that the codon reported as last of exon 2 of the CDKN2C gene is rather the first codon of exon 3",

    "Title": "Intratumor genetic heterogeneity in advanced human colorectal adenocarcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Colorectal carcinogenesis is widely accepted as one of the best-characterized examples of stepwise progression. The existing colorectal carcinogenesis model assumes genetic homogeneity of individual tumors for the main known genetic alterations: K-ras and p53 genes point mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 5q and 18q. The object of the present study was to demonstrate the existence of an intratumor genetic heterogeneity in advanced sporadic colorectal carcinoma for these genetic alterations. Using improved tissue microdissection and DNA extraction, for each tumor, amplifiable DNA was obtained from 15 to 20 areas, of which 1 to 2 concerned lymph node metastases (LNM). This study revealed that 10 of 15 (67%) analyzed tumors were heterogeneous for at least 1 genetic alteration, with between 2 and 6 genotypically different clones detected per tumor. No correlation was observed between the genotype of these subclones and histological differentiation or invasive propensity. Intratumor heterogeneity was more frequently observed for LOH than for point mutations, 67% and 58% for LOH at APC and DCC locus, and 20% for mutation of either the K-ras or p53 gene. In 5 of the 9 (56%) heterogeneous cases with available LNM, the genotype observed in the LNM was different from that of the main clone in the primary tumor, and moreover, 2 of the LNM displayed a genotype undetected in the primary tumor. In conclusion, intratumor genetic heterogeneity was demonstrated in advanced sporadic colorectal carcinoma and was represented as topographically distinct genotypic subclones. Taking into account such a significant genetic heterogeneity of colorectal tumors, the use of genetic markers for prognosis management should be reconsidered",

    "Title": "Tumor heterogeneity in small hepatocellular carcinoma: analysis of tumor cell proliferation, expression and mutation of p53 AND beta-catenin",
    "Abstract": "Most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) first occur as well-differentiated HCCs, from which poorly differentiated HCC cells develop because of dedifferentiation. In this study, we try to clarify the changes of dedifferentiation and cell proliferative activity and their relationship in small HCCs (less than 3.0 cm in diameter) and try to learn the mechanism of these changes by analysing the expressions and genetic changes of proliferation-related genes p53 and beta-catenin. Of 41 surgically resected small HCCs, 11 were identified to have tumor heterogeneity. DNA from the 11 small HCCs, consisting of 29 intratumoral lesions and 11 noncancerous liver tissues adjacent to HCCs, was extracted from paraffin embedded tissue sections. Exons 5-8 of p53 gene and exon 3 of beta-catenin gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed by direct sequence. The serial sections were also immunostained by anti-Ki-67, p53 and beta-catenin antibody. Immunohistochemistry showed that the p53 overexpression was significantly related to the proliferative activities as evaluated by Ki-67 immunostaining and to the histological differentiation. The expression of beta-catenin was found to be heterogeneously distributed not only in various histological grades of the same tumor but also in areas of the same histological grade. p53 and beta-catenin gene mutations were detected in 1 tumor respectively, both of which were second primary HCCs and also recurred later. The p53 mutation showed the same mutation pattern in heterogeneous subpopulations. beta-catenin mutation was detected only in the less differentiated lesion but not in the well-differentiated lesion of tumor. In conclusion, our findings suggest that there was histological heterogeneity in small but established HCC, which was accompanied by increased proliferative activity and p53 overexpression. The overexpression of beta-catenin may be related to the proliferative activity and dedifferentiation of HCC",

    "Title": "Mutations with loss of heterozygosity of p53 are common in therapy-related myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia after exposure to alkylating agents and significantly associated with deletion or loss of 5q, a complex karyotype, and a poor prognosis",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To study mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of p53 in therapy-related myelodysplasia (t-MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two unselected patients with t-MDS and 25 patients with t-AML were studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) at the DNA level and by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-SSCP at the mRNA level, and cases with aberrant SSCP patterns were sequenced. RESULTS: Somatically acquired mutations of p53 were observed in 21 of 77 cases of t-MDS or t-AML, and 19 of these 21 patients had received alkylating agents. Single-base substitutions at A:T pairs were more common in t-MDS and t-AML, whereas single-base substitutions at G:C pairs are most common in MDS and AML de novo and in solid tumors. Six patients demonstrated a cytogenetic loss of 17p13, and these six and an additional nine patients with p53 mutations demonstrated LOH of p53 at the DNA or mRNA level. This suggests a cytogenetic loss of the normal p53 allele in these nine cases combined with duplication of the homologous chromosome 17 carrying the mutated p53 allele. Mutations of p53 were significantly associated with deletion or loss of 5q (P &lt;.0001) and a complex karyotype (P =.0001), but surprisingly were not associated with deletion or loss of 7q (P =.73), and were infrequent in patients with balanced chromosome translocations (P =.03). Mutations of p53 were more common in older patients (P =.036) and were associated with an extremely poor prognosis (P =.014), apparently restricted to the 15 cases with LOH of p53 ( P =.046). CONCLUSION: Mutations with loss of function of p53 are significantly associated with deletion or loss of 5q in t-MDS and t-AML after previous treatment with alkylating agents and are associated with genetic instability",

    "Title": "Mutations and Allelic Loss of p53 in Primary Tumor DNA From Potentially Cured Patients With Colorectal Carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare p53 alterations in survivors and nonsurvivors after surgery for colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine potentially cured patients with colorectal carcinoma, without recurrent disease for more than 6 years after their primary surgery, were selected to match a group of 41 colorectal cancer patients with early metastatic spread to the liver. All patients were screened for mutations in the p53 gene, exons 5 to 9, by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and subsequent sequencing. RESULTS: The frequency of p53 mutations was significantly different in cured patients (60%) compared with patients with early relapse (41%, P &lt;.05). A significant difference was found in the distribution of mutations, indicating that potentially cured patients had a different proportion of mutations in conserved regions of p53 (P =.02). This difference was explained by a significantly different frequency of mutations in exon 8 (40% v 15%, P =.03), which is part of the conserved region V. All mutations in region V were codon 273 mutations in cured patients, whereas three of four mutations were located in codon 273 in patients with metastatic disease. Allelic loss of p53 (loss of heterozygosity [LOH]) was demonstrated in 26% of the cured patients and in 39% of patients with metastatic disease (P =.36). The combination of mutation and LOH of p53 was the same (17%) in both groups. CONCLUSION: A large number of p53 mutations in colorectal cancer do not promote disease progression. Some mutations, particularly within conserved regions, may even counteract negative functional effects of other p53 structural alterations. A complete loss of p53 function was not related to survival or progression after curative operation of colorectal carcinoma",

    "Title": "Genotype-phenotype correlation in gemistocytic astrocytomas",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Gemistocytic astrocytomas often behave aggressively and carry the least favorable prognosis among diffuse astrocytomas. The frequency of p53 mutations has been reported to be significantly higher in the gemistocytic variant as compared with other astrocytomas. METHODS: Between 1985 and 1998, we selected 25 tumor samples from among 201 samples from patients with gemistocytic astrocytomas operated on at the Mayo Clinic. Exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were sequenced using an automated deoxyribonucleic acid sequencer. Morphometric characterization of individual gemistocytes was performed using an image analysis program. RESULTS: Of 25 tissue samples analyzed, 16 were found to carry a p53 missense mutation (three in exon 5, three in exon 6, one in exon 7, and nine in exon 8), and one sequence variant was synonymous. Mutations were clustered at codons 151 (2 of 17 mutations), 193 (3 of 17 mutations), and 273 (5 of 17 mutations) of the p53 gene. Patients whose tumors carried a p53 mutation were significantly younger than other patients, and their tumors tended to accumulate more p53 protein than those of other patients. Phenotype analysis of gemistocytes revealed that the sizes of tumor cell nuclei and of entire tumor cells in the same tissue area were positively correlated. Smaller tumor cell nuclei tended to be less circular or more atypical. In addition, more atypical gemistocytes were found in tumors lacking a wild-type p53 allele as well as in tissue from patients whose postoperative survival was shorter. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm that the frequency of p53 mutations is significantly higher (approximately twofold) in gemistocytic astrocytomas as compared with other astrocytoma subtypes. Whether the high frequency of p53 mutations contributes to the more aggressive behavior of gemistocytic astrocytomas, however, remains unclear",

    "Title": "p53 mutation is infrequent in clear cell carcinoma of the ovary",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: p53 gene alteration has been extensively studied in epithelial ovarian cancer. However, its occurrence in clear cell carcinoma, an infrequent histologic subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer, is rarely reported. The aim of this study is to determine the status of p53 gene alteration in this distinct type of ovarian carcinoma. METHODS: Paraffin blocks of tumors from 38 patients with primary or recurrent ovarian clear cell carcinoma were studied for p53 alteration. All these tumors were subjected to immunohistochemical and molecular analysis. Two monoclonal antibodies (DO-7 and PAb 1801) were used for immunohistochemical staining. Genomic DNAs extracted from paraffin blocks of the 38 tumors were subscribed for a nested polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) analysis. Tumors showing band shift on SSCP were further prepared for DNA sequencing to determine the site of mutation. RESULTS: Overexpression of p53 was observed in only one stage III clear cell carcinoma. However, focal positive p53 staining was noted in another five tumors. Of the six tumors showing positive immunohistochemistry, p53 alterations were noted in four tumors. Three tumors revealed a missense point mutation: two were in exon 7 (TCT(227) --&gt; TTT and GGC(245) --&gt; AGC) and one was in exon 5 (CGC(156) --&gt; CAC). Another tumor revealed a 12-bp deletion in two possible ways: it might involve the last four codons at the 3' end of exon 4 (nucleotides 12,288-12,299) or it might cross over the splice junction between exon 4 and intron 4 (nucleotides 12,290-12,301). The former would result in a predicted protein product of 389 amino acids whereas the latter would cause a frameshift in the gene sequence and would result in a truncated protein. CONCLUSION: Mutations in p53 appear to be much less frequent in clear cell carcinoma than in other histologic types of epithelial ovarian cancer. We suggest that p53 alterations may not play an important role in the development of clear cell carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Objective. The purpose of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that mutation of TP53 is a requirement for BRCA-associated cancer development. Methods. A cell line experimentally deficient in BRCA1 protein was constructed using a regulatable antisense expression vector expressing 4000 bp from the BRCA1 cDNA. Changes in BRCA1, p53, and p21 protein levels were assayed by immunoblotting. Ovarian tumors with germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 were screened for mutations in TP53 by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Results. Antisense inhibition of BRCA1 protein caused p53 and p21 protein levels to rise, indicating that partial loss of BRCA1 function activates the p53 DNA damage response pathway. Somatic mutation of TP53 was observed in 7 of 14 BRCA-associated ovarian tumors. Conclusions. Our findings provide novel evidence that loss of BRCA1 function in human cells activates the p53 DNA damage response pathway and that loss of this pathway, by somatic mutation of TP53, is a likely requirement for BRCA-associated tumor development.

    "Title": "Dominant-negative mutation of p53 tumor suppressor gene in endometrial carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that mutation of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene is involved in endometrial carcinogenesis. However, the status of p53 function in endometrial cancers has not yet been investigated in detail. METHODS: We surveyed inactivating p53 mutations in endometrial carcinomas using the yeast p53 functional assay, which can evaluate the transcriptional activity of p53 in vivo in yeast. To the detected p53 mutants, we also applied a transdominance assay, which assesses the dominant-negative property of mutants. RESULTS: Of 23 endometrial carcinomas, 9 tumors (39.1%) were found to harbor p53 mutations. Only 1 of the 6 mutants in 18 endometrioid-type tumors showed dominant-negative capacity. In contrast to the endometrioid-type tumor, all 3 mutations in 5 serous-type tumors (R273H, 9-bp deletion in codons 240-243, and R248W) showed dominant-negative capacity and presented in a homozygous state in the tumors, indicating a complete functional inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: Although this study included a relatively small number of cases and therefore is a preliminary study, these results suggest that the dominant-negative mutation of the TP53 gene is related to serous adenocarcinoma. The role of the dominant- negative status of p53 mutants in endometrial carcinogenesis and progression of this disease should be further investigated",

    "Abstract": "Thirty-three cases of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) from the archives of National Coal Workers' Autopsy Study were studied for mutational alterations in p53 and K-ras using PCR-SSCP, DNA sequencing and PCR-oligonucleotide probe hybridization techniques. Mutations of the p53 were observed in 4 smokers (19%) and one in a never smoker (8%). Two polymorphisms in smokers were detected at codon 213, a common site for sequence variation. Among the smokers the p53 mutations were in the heavy smokers. In never smokers there was only a single p53 mutation and two K-ras mutations. In never smokers the frequency of K- ras mutations was similar (17%) in smokers, but one never smoker had two K-ras mutations. Mutations of p53 were more frequent in adenocarcinomas (27%) and they were AT-->GC transitions. Four of 11 (36%) adenocarcinomas were found to have K-ras codon 12 mutations, and one adenocarcinoma had two K-ras mutations. There were two large cell undifferentiated carcinomas with p53 mutation and one with a K-ras mutation. Two of the 16 squamous cell carcinomas were positive for p53 mutation, while no K-ras mutations were found in this group. The results of these preliminary studies indicate a moderately different mutational spectrum of p53 and K-ras in coal miners independent of cigarette smoking. The mutational spectrum observed in this study of coal miners with heavy cigarette smoking history suggest a protective effect of coal mine dust in preventing abnormal mutations induced by chemical carcinogens in cigarette smoke or reactive oxygen species. These limited preliminary studies provide insight into the possibility of accurately measuring changes in etiologic markers to unravel the uncertainties of cancer in coal miners",

    "Abstract": "Lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) are a distinct subgroup of extranodal B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Most studies have failed to demonstrate the clonal rearrangement of BCL-1, BCL-2 or c-MYC genes for MALT lymphomas. Further, alteration of the p53 gene is rarely demonstrated in low-grade MALT lymphomas, but can be detected in high-grade disease. Lymphomas of the ocular adnexa represent approximately eight percent of all extranodal lymphomas, most of which are MALT lymphomas, but few studies had explored the alterations of BCL- 1, BCL-2, c-MYC and p53 genes specifically for ocular MALT lymphomas. We investigated the changes to BCL-1, BCL-2, c-MYC and p53 genes in these lymphomas for Taiwanese patients. Clonal rearrangement for immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH), BCL-1, BCL-2, c-MYC and p53 genes was examined for 16 cases of ocular MALT lymphoma. Restriction-length polymorphism and polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) of the DNA, corresponding to exons 5 through 9, followed by DNA sequencing, were utilized to analyze the possible mutations of the p53 gene for these tumors. Thirteen of the cases revealed rearranged IgH genes using Southern blotting or PCR. No rearrangement of BCL-1, BCL-2, c-MYC or p53 genes was discovered, with point mutation of the p53 gene in one case. As for other types of MALT lymphomas, BCL-1, BCL-2 and c-MYC genes are not implicated in the pathogenesis of the ocular sub-group. Although alteration of the p53 gene is rare for low-grade ocular MALT lymphoma, its role in disease progression merits further research",

    "Title": "Analysis of p53 mutation and expression in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma",
    "Abstract": "Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is a rare, superficially situated tumor that most frequently occurs in the temporal lobe of young adults and is often associated with seizures. It generally has a relatively favorable prognosis. Prior studies have shown that TP53 mutations may occur in up to 25% of PXAs, suggesting that PXA may have an etiology similar to diffuse astrocytoma rather than pilocytic astrocytoma. In the present study, we performed immunostaining for p53 protein and examined the mutation status of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene in 55 PXAs, 8 of which had undergone one or multiple recurrences. Of 55 primary PXAs, 35 (64%) showed staining in <1% of tumor cells, 15 (27%) in 1-10%, 4 (7%) in 11-50%, and only 1 (2%) in >50%. No significant increase in p53 protein expression was noted in recurrences, even when associated with increased histological anaplasia. We found a TP53 heterozygous mutation in exon 7 in 1 of 47 primary tumors that yielded useable DNA, and in its recurrence 3 years later. This tumor, a grade II PXA, did not show signs of anaplastic transformation at recurrence. Eleven additional recurrences from 7 patients, 5 of which showed signs of histological anaplasia, did not show TP53 mutations in exons 5-8. Based on our data, the p53 mutation appears to be an uncommon (2%) genetic event in PXA formation and does not appear to be involved in tumor progression. Consequently, our findings suggest that the genetic events that underlie PXA formation differ from those involved in diffuse astrocytoma",

    "Abstract": "The K-ras, p53, p16 and DPC4 genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation- specific polymerase chain reaction. These cell lines showed mutations in K-ras and p53 at frequencies of 91% and 95%, respectively. Alterations in p16INK4a were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions, seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases. Eight cell lines (36%) had an alteration of DPC4, including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions. The most typical mutational profile involved K-ras, p53, and p16INK4a, concurrently aberrated in 20 cases (91%). Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes. Inactivation of DPC4 was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes. This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway",

    "Abstract": "In order to assess the suitability of cryopreserved neoplastic tissues for xenografting into nude (nu/nu) mice, we compared the take rate in 28 samples of pancreatic ductal carcinoma. Eleven fresh samples were implanted in nu/nu mice, and 17 were frozen in cryopreserving solution and implanted at a later time. All samples were examined for the presence of neoplastic tissue in cryostat sections. A total of 15 tumors grew in the animals; five from the freshly implanted samples and ten from those cryopreserved. Ten xenografted tumors were characterized for alterations in p53, K-ras, and p16 genes, which were found in six, eight, and nine cases, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the take rate for xenografting is comparable between cryopreserved and fresh tissue samples.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: p53 gene mutation and p53 protein accumulation is the most common event in human cancers. The present study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of p53 mutations in patients with gastric carcinoma in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor samples from 36 patients with primary gastric carcinoma undergoing radical gastrectomy were evaluated. The mutational status of the p53 (exons 5 to 8) was screened by polymerase chain reaction/single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis followed by direct sequencing. These results were compared with p53 protein expression as assessed by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Of all 36 gastric carcinomas, mutations of the p53 gene were found in 7 cases (19.4%). These results from direct sequencing indicated that mutations consisted of five missence mutations, one silent mutation and one mutation within the splice donor site of intron 5. Mutations were found at codon 145 in exon 5 (1 case), intron 5 (1 case), codon 248 in exon 7 (1 case), codon 251 in exon 7 (2 cases), codon 285 in exon 8 (1 case) and codon 287 in exon 8 (1 case). The mutation hot spot at codon 251 in gastric cancer has not been observed previously. Over-expression of p53 oncoprotein was observed in 10 patients (27.8%) immunohistochemically. CONCLUSIONS: p53 gene mutation might contribute to the pathogenesis of human gastric carcinoma. However, the suggestion awaits further investigation for confirmation",

    "Title": "Detection of a novel point mutation in the p53 gene in grade II astrocytomas by PCR-SSCP analysis with additional Klenow treatment",
    "Abstract": "Using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) with additional Klenow treatment and direct sequencing mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene were analyzed from 21 cases of human astrocytomas. Three cases had p53 gene mutations: two of them were glioblastomas showing a point mutation, one in exon 5 and the other in 6. The last one was a gemistocytic astrocytoma showing a point mutation in exon 5. The frequency of p53 gene mutations in the astrocytomas examined was 14.3% (3 out of 21). No SSCP alterations were observed in any of the p53 fragments amplified from WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytomas and WHO grade III anaplastic astrocytomas. Further examination by direct sequencing showed that two mutations of glioblastomas had single-base substitutions resulting in silent and missense mutations, whereas one of the gemistocytic astrocytomas had a double-base substitution resulting in a missense mutation. The present studies revealed that all mutations were located outside the hot spots and, interestingly, one of them disclosed a missense mutation in exon 5 at codon 166, which was first detected in a grade II astrocytoma (gemistocytic type). It is possible that the missense mutation at this codon may be associated with special risk factors for the development of astrocytic tumors in Thai patients",

    "Title": "Topotecan (Hycamtin) responsiveness in human renal carcinoma cell lines of the clear cell and papillary types",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since no effective therapeutic approach is yet known for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), we analyzed the effects of topotecan (Hycamtin), a novel topoisomerase I-inhibitor, in RCC cell lines of the clear cell and papillary/chromophilic types. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects of topotecan were analyzed in 20 RCC cell lines by MTT-assay and light microscopic apoptosis counting. Moreover, Bcl-2 and Bax expression was investigated by Northern blot and immunocytochemistry while the p53 mutation status was analyzed by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Exposure to clinically relevant concentrations of topotecan (i.e. < or = 1 microg/ml) resulted in a significant (p<0.05) dose-dependent reduction of cell number in 17 out of 20 RCC cell lines. The reduction of cell number was paralleled by an increase in apoptotic cell death. Papillary/chromophilic RCCs exhibited a significantly (p<0.05) more pronounced responsiveness to topotecan than clear cell RCCs. Moreover, the effects of topotecan proved to be superior to those of 5- fluorouracil (5-FU), an anticancer drug currently used in the therapy of RCCs. No correlation became evident between responsiveness to topotecan and the expression levels of Bcl-2 and Bax. Moreover, the response to topotecan could not be correlated with the p53 mutation status of our RCC cell lines. CONCLUSION: Clinically relevant concentrations of topotecan induced apoptosis in RCC cell lines more effectively than 5-FU. Further testing will show whether topotecan- induced apoptosis can be exploited for the treatment of RCCs in vivo as well",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human carcinomas not only consist of neoplastic epithelial cells but also of tumor stroma, which may play an important role in tumor-progression. Whereas the tumor surrounding stroma is generally believed to represent a reactive component induced by tumor cell derived factors, a contribution of neoplastic cells to stroma formation via epithelium-mesenchyme transition during tumor invasion has become a novel concept in recent years. MATERIALS, METHODS AND RESULTS: We here show, by laser-assisted microdissection, that frequent genetic alterations in non-hereditary invasive human colon and breast cancers (loss of heterozygosity and TP53 mutations) occur not only in the neoplastic epithelial cells, but also in the adjacent fibroblastic stroma and that both components can share clonal features. CONCLUSION: Tumor cell-mesenchyme transitions are among the possible explanations for these findings and could actually occur during tumor invasion in vivo",

    "Title": "Characteristics of mutations in the p53 gene in oral squamous cell carcinoma associated with betel quid chewing and cigarette smoking in Taiwanese",
    "Abstract": "p53 mutations are etiologically associated with the development of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) or are associated with exposure to specific carcinogens. In this study, we used PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing to analyze the conserved regions of the p53 gene (exons 5-9) in OSCC tumor specimens from 187 patients with varied histories of betel quid, tobacco and alcohol use. Ninety-one of the 187 OSCCs (48.66%) showed p53 gene mutations at exons 5-9. The incidence of p53 mutations was not associated with age, sex, TNM stage, status of cigarette smoking or betel quid chewing. However, alcohol drinkers exhibited a significantly higher incidence (57/101, 56.44%) of p53 mutations than non-users (39.53%, 34/86) (P = 0.02). The effect of alcohol on the incidence of p53 mutations was still statistically significant (RR = 2.24; 95% CI, 1.21-4.15) after adjustment for cigarette smoking and betel quid (BQ) chewing. G:C to A:T transitions were the predominant mutations observed and associated with BQ and tobacco use. Alcohol drinking could enhance these transitions. After adjustment for cigarette smoking and BQ chewing, alcohol drinking still showed an independent effect on G:C to A:T transitions (RR = 2.41; 95% CI, 1.01-5.74). These findings strongly suggest an important contributive role of tobacco carcinogens to p53 mutation in this series of Taiwanese OSCCs and alcohol might enhance these mutagenic effects. As safrole-DNA adducts have been detected in 77% (23/30) of the OSCC tissues from Taiwanese oral cancer patients with a BQ chewing history, we cannot rule out the possibility that safrole or other carcinogens present in the BQ may cause a similar pattern of mutagenesis. Determination of the role of safrole and other carcinogens present in BQ on the pattern of p53 gene mutation in OSCC will require further study",

    "Title": "Heterogeneity of p53 mutational status in the superficial spreading type of early gastric carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The superficial spreading type of gastric carcinoma may originate from either a single cellular clone or from several different clones; this issue remains controversial. Indeed, the p53 gene has been shown to play an important role in gastric carcinogenesis, but there have been only a few reports on the heterogeneity of gastric carcinoma with respect to the p53 gene. METHODS: We analyzed seven cases of the superficial spreading type of gastric submucosal carcinomas (80 lesions; 10 to 17 per case) which showed different histological types and/or different p53 protein staining patterns. Direct sequences of polymerase chain reaction products were used for the analysis. RESULTS: p53 Gene heterogeneity in mucosal carcinoma lesions was detected in three cases. However, in all of the cases, the p53 mutational pattern was identical to that found in the submucosal carcinoma lesions. In the heterogeneous cases, the mutation in the submucosal carcinoma was one of the mutation patterns found among the mucosal carcinoma lesions. More precisely, the mutational pattern of both submucosal carcinoma lesions and the mucosal lesions located just above them, was identical. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that, with regard to the p53 gene, in some superficial spreading types of gastric carcinomas, there are various subclones in the mucosal carcinoma; one of these subclones becomes predominant through clonal selection, and, thus, invades the submucosa",

    "Title": "A unique basal pattern of p53 expression in ulcerative colitis is associated with mutation in the p53 gene",
    "Abstract": "AIMS: The p53 protein is implicated in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and death. As part of a study characterizing p53 alterations in colonic mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis, we identified a unique pattern of basal p53 immunoreactivity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue samples (n=180) from 42 ulcerative colitis patients were evaluated for p53 alterations by immunohistochemistry, loss of heterozygosity analysis, polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. In addition, the expression of the p53- associated proteins p21waf1/cip1 and MDM2 was evaluated immunohistochemically. Three basic patterns of p53 immunoreactivity were observed: (i) isolated immunoreactive cells in the crypt bases; (ii) strongly positive cells confined to the basal half of the glands; and (iii) diffusely staining cells. The basal staining pattern was observed in both non-neoplastic tissues and in some areas of dysplasia, and was associated with normal expression of p21waf1/cip1 in all cases, and with p53 mutation in seven of 11 cases. CONCLUSIONS: The basal pattern of p53 expression is associated with mutation in the p53 gene, and appears to be an early change in a subgroup of ulcerative colitis patients. The significance of this pattern of immunoreactivity and the mechanism by which it develops are discussed",

    "Abstract": "AIMS: We investigated p53, Ki67, MDM2, and p21WAF1/CIP1 in order to evaluate its relationship with prognosis in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST). METHODS AND RESULTS: In 49 cases of MPNSTs, the immunohistochemical studies of Ki67, p53, MDM2, p21WAF1/CIP1 and polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR- SSCP) with direct sequencing of p53 were performed with the formalin- fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. In 43 cases with survival data available, an evaluation of the prognostic significance of clinicopathological factors was also carried out. A high Ki67 labelling index (LI) (>25%) was correlated with a reduced survival rate in the 43 cases of MPNST (P=0.0106, log-rank test). Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the Ki67 LI and the immunohistochemical expression of p53 or MDM2. In 17 MPNST cases, PCR amplification of exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene was successful. One case showed a base change of codon 240 (AGT-->AGC), but translated amino acid (Ser) remained unchanged. Multivariate Cox analysis of our series showed that the association of von Recklinghausen's disease, tumour depth, and the presence of rhabdomyoblasts (malignant triton tumour) each had an independent negative impact on overall survival. CONCLUSION: High Ki67 LI (>25%) was of significant prognostic value in MPNST",

    "Title": "Early mycosis fungoides: molecular analysis for its diagnosis and the absence of p53 gene mutations in cases with progression",
    "Abstract": "The histological diagnosis of initial mycosis fungoides (MF) and the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for its progression and transformation to the more highly malignant variants of MF remain largely unknown. Because of the rare occurrence of these tumours, the need for snap frozen skin biopsy specimens and the difficulty to obtain suitable material for karyotypic and genotypic analysis, specific cytogenetic and molecular lesions have not yet been identified. In particular the role of known oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, including the p53 gene, in the pathogenesis and clinical progression of MF has not been extensively investigated. The present study was carried out using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique combined with temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) to detect mutations of the p53 gene in 58 patients with MF. TGGE analysis was also used in combination with clonality analysis by means of T-cell receptor gamma (TCRG) gene rearrangement studies to distinguish parapsoriasis en plaque and initial MF from patch/plaque stage MF. More than 83% of the diagnoses of initial MF could be confirmed using PCR-TGGE analysis. However, although the sensitive TGGE analysis was used for all exons, p53 gene polymorphisms were found in 4 and p53 gene mutation in only 1 of 58 biopsy specimens. It appears unlikely that p53 gene mutations play a role in either the pathogenesis of parapsoriasis and initial MF or their progression to advanced stages of MF. However, TCRG gene rearrangement studies by means of TCR-TGGE analysis may be useful for distinguishing histologically discordant cases of initial MF",

    "Title": "Frequent inactivation of the tp53 gene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma from a high-risk population in china",
    "Abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common fatal cancers worldwide, and north central China has some of the highest rates in the world. Previous studies from tumors in this area of China have shown high frequencies of allelic loss on chromosome 17p13-11, which includes the region where the TP53 gene is found. We examined 56 ESCC patients using single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing to assess the frequency and spectrum of TP53 mutation and the association between allelic loss at microsatellite marker TP53 and TP53 mutations. Ninety-six % of cases were found to have at least one genetic alteration, including TP53 mutation (77%), allelic loss within the TP53 gene (73%), and/or loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 microsatellite marker (80%); 75% had two or more such alterations, including 59% with both a point mutation and an intragenic allelic loss (&quot;two hits&quot;). The majority of mutations observed were in exon 5, where the most common type of nucleotide substitution was a G:C--&gt;A:T or C:G--&gt;T:A transition, including half that occurred at CpG sites. Allelic loss was most commonly found in exon 4 but was very common in exon 5 as well. Taken together, the multiple genetic alterations of TP53 in this population at high risk for ESCC indicate that there is a very high degree of genetic instability in these tumors, that TP53 is a primary target for inactivation, and that this tumor suppressor gene plays a critical role in the carcinogenesis process for ESCC",

    "Abstract": "A p53 yeast functional assay, which cannot only detect p53 gene mutations but also can assess p53 gene function, was used to screen for p53 gene dysfunction in human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. Surgically resected frozen tissues of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas from 57 patients were examined for p53 gene mutation. Because the mean age of the patients diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was 64 years, we classified those who were &lt;65 years of age as the Young Group and classified the others as the Elderly Group. The incidence of p53 gene mutations was 43 of 57 (75%). The incidence of p53 gene mutations observed in the Young Group was significantly higher than in the Elderly Group (P = 0.0007). Alcohol and smoking status did not relate to p53 gene mutation expression. Survival rate after surgery was not significantly associated with the presence of p53 gene mutation. However, in the Young Group with p53 gene mutation, those who had null mutations had a significantly shorter survival than those without null mutations (P = 0.0455). No other clinicopathological factors were associated with p53 gene mutations. Possibly, there may be a difference in esophageal carcinogenesis between the Young and the Elderly groups, because the incidence of p53 gene mutations is different between the two groups. In the Young Group, p53 gene mutation may cause esophageal carcinogenesis, and null mutation for p53 gene is a significant prognostic factor",

    "Title": "The p53 Mutational Spectrum Associated with BRCA1 Mutant Ovarian Cancer",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Cancer-specific p53 mutational spectra have been identified. Data from murine models and human BRCA1-related hereditary breast cancers suggest that both unique and specific BRCA1-associated p53 mutations may be found in BRCA1-related ovarian cancers. Experimental DESIGN: The p53 mutational spectrum from ovarian cancers containing either somatic or germ-line BRCA1 mutations was compared with that of sporadic ovarian cancers defined as those diagnosed with a negative family history for breast/ovarian cancer in a three-generation pedigree. Tumor DNA was screened over exons 2-11 of the p53 gene by the PCR and single-strand confirmation polymorphism analysis of the amplimers. Cycle-based DNA sequencing from separate reactions was used to confirm p53 mutations. RESULTS: p53 gene mutations were detected in 42 of 86 sporadic ovarian cancers, compared with 13 of 15 cancers with somatic BRCA1 mutations (P = 0.007) and 16 of 20 cancers with germ-line BRCA1 mutations (P = 0.01). p53 null mutations were found in 31.4% of BRCA1 mutant cancers, compared with only 9.3% of the sporadic cancers (P = 0.002). The p53 mutational spectrum of germ-line BRCA1-related cancers was shifted toward transversions, frameshifts, and non-CpG transitions relative to the spectrum of sporadic ovarian cancers. Thirty-three unique ovarian cancer p53 mutations were sequenced. However, the specific p53 mutations in the BRCA1 mutant cancers were no more unique to this cohort than the p53 mutations of the sporadic cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian cancers containing somatic or germ-line BRCA1 mutations are uniformly accompanied by p53 dysfunction. This finding offers additional support to observations regarding the importance of p53/BRCA1 interactions in ovarian carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Multiple high-grade bronchial dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma: concordant and discordant mutations",
    "Abstract": "Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) involving chromosomes 3p, 5q, 9p, or 17p and aberrant expression or mutation of p53 are reported previously in selected bronchial dysplasias and squamous cell cancers (SCCs). Yet, comprehensive analyses of LOH patterns at these chromosomal sites and of p53 alterations are not reported for histologically normal bronchial epithelium, high-grade bronchial dysplasia, and SCC present in the same pulmonary resections. Whether concordant or discordant genetic changes are detected in these bronchial tissues, especially when multiple high-grade dysplastic bronchial lesions are present, was studied. Genomic DNA was microdissected from eight pulmonary SCCs and high-grade dysplastic lesions that were associated with SCC. In four cases, two independent high-grade dysplastic bronchial lesions were identified. When available, histologically normal bronchial epithelium was microdissected. Germ-line genomic DNA was isolated from normal lymph nodes. LOH was assessed for 15 microsatellite markers on chromosomes 3p, 5q, 9p, or 17p, sites frequently deleted in lung cancers. Immunohistochemical p53 expression was studied and correlated with p53 DNA sequence analyses. Progressive LOH for these markers was found when SCCs were compared with high-grade dysplasia and histologically normal bronchial epithelium present in the same resections. Histologically normal bronchial specimens had LOH in up to 27% of informative markers. High-grade dysplastic lesions exhibited LOH for 18-45% and SCC had LOH for 18-73% of the markers. Common regions of LOH were found in some dysplasias compared with SCCs. In other dysplasias, discordance was found relative to SCCs, especially for p53 mutations. In cases with a single or second high-grade dysplasia associated with SCC, heterogeneity in LOH markers was detected. These concordant and discordant changes were consistent with convergent and divergent clonal selection pathways in pulmonary squamous cell carcinogenesis. Some histologically normal bronchial epithelial tissues had genetic changes more similar to those in the SCCs than in dysplastic lesions. DNA loss or mutations accumulate in SCC, but discordant genetic changes can exist in the same carcinogen-exposed bronchial tissues. These findings have implications for lung cancer prevention trials",

    "Title": "Correlation of p53 mutations with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy and shortened survival in ovarian cancer",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The p53 tumor suppressor gene plays a central role in cell cycle regulation and induction of apoptosis. We analyzed p53 alterations and their impact on response to chemotherapy and clinical outcome in ovarian cancer patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: One hundred seventy-eight ovarian carcinomas, snap frozen and stored at -80 degrees C, were analyzed for mutations of the p53 gene (exons 2-11) by single- strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing and for p53 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (monoclonal antibody DO7). RESULTS: p53 mutations were found in 56% (99 of 178) of the tumors, and 62% of these were located in evolutionary highly conserved domains of the gene. Time to progression and overall survival were significantly shortened in patients with p53 mutations compared with wild-type p53 (P = 0.029 and P = 0.014) and patients with mutations in highly conserved domains as opposed to nonconserved domains or wild-type p53 (P = 0.010 and P = 0.007). p53 protein overexpression (>10% positively stained nuclei) was found in 62% (110 of 178). Time to progression and overall survival were shorter in cases with p53 overexpression (cutpoint, 10%: P = 0.071 and P = 0.056) but only marginally significant. Resistance to adjuvant cisplatin or carboplatin chemotherapy was significantly more frequent in patients with p53 overexpression (P = 0.001) or p53 missense mutations (P = 0.008) than patients with normal p53. CONCLUSIONS: p53 alterations correlate significantly with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy, early relapse, and shortened overall survival in ovarian cancer patients in univariate analysis. In multivariable analysis though, p53 was not an independent prognostic factor",

    "Title": "Persistence of genetically altered fields in head and neck cancer patients: biological and clinical implications",
    "Abstract": "In 1953, Slaughter et al. [D. P. Slaughter et al., Cancer (Phila.), 6: 963-968, 1953] proposed the concept of field cancerization in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) and discussed its clinical significance for the development of second primary tumors and local recurrences. To define the process of field cancerization and its putative clinical implications, we analyzed genetic aberrations in HNSCC and the accompanying macroscopically normal mucosa. In 28 HNSCC patients, loss of heterozygosity was determined in tumor and five noncontiguous mucosal biopsies using eight microsatellite markers at 9p, 3p, and 17p. For patients who showed loss of heterozygosity in their mucosal biopsies, all margins of the surgical specimen were subsequently analyzed to determine the extension of the field. In these cases, additional markers at 8p, 13q, and 18q as well as p53 mutations were included to determine subclonal differences between field and tumor. Genetically altered fields were detected in 36% (10 of 28) of the HNSCC patients. The field varied in size between patients and consisted of genetically different subclones. In 7 of 10 cases, the field extended into the surgical margins. One particular patient with a genetically altered field in a surgical margin developed a local recurrence after 28 months of follow-up. Microsatellite analysis showed that this recurrence had more molecular markers in common with the nonresected premalignant field than with the original tumor, suggesting that this persistent field has progressed further into a new malignancy. Our data show that genetically altered mucosa remains after treatment in a significant proportion of HNSCC patients, which may explain in part the high frequency of local recurrences and second primary tumors. Adequate identification and risk assessment of these genetically altered fields may have profound implications for future patient management",

The frequency of p53 mutation in bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC; 0% in 17 cases) and BAC with invasive growth component (BAC-invasive; 11% in 27 cases), which is conventionally categorized as the mixed subtype in WHO typing, were apparently significantly lower than in other types (non-BAC including acinar, papillary, solid, or mixed histology with these subtypes; 48% in 101 cases; P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that the histological subtype including BAC-invasive was a strong, independent, and significant prognostic factor (P < 0.03), as were tumor size and pathological stage (P < 0.001 and 0.002, respectively) for overall survival. However, the occurrence of p53 mutation itself was seen to be significant only in case of the univariate analysis. Therefore, histological subtyping may be a better prognostic indicator than is p53 mutation. These findings suggest that the WHO classification with the BAC and BAC-invasive from other histological subtypes may prove useful to predict the outcome for surgically treated patients with lung adenocarcinoma",

    "Title": "Genetic alterations in tp53 in recurrent urothelial cancer: a longitudinal study",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Because bladder cancer has a recurrence rate that can be as high as 90% at 2 years, we sought to clarify whether these metachronous tumors are polyclonal or monoclonal in origin. We have examined the genetic alterations of the TP53 gene in a cohort of patients with urothelial cancer who underwent multiple biopsies at different times and sites because of tumor recurrence and/or progression. We postulated that if tumor cells at different points in the natural history of the disease contain an identical mutation in the TP53 gene, this pattern could provide evidence for the monoclonality of the recurrent bladder tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fifty-three biopsy specimens from 13 patients at different times and sites were selected for this study. Microdissection was used to ensure the purity of tumor cells. DNA extraction, PCR, and direct sequencing of exons 5 through 8 of the TP53 gene were conducted following protocols optimized in our laboratory. RESULTS: We found that specimens from seven patients carried tumor- specific TP53 mutations. The number of lesions in these patients ranged from two to seven, extending from 2 to 4 years. All of the seven patients displayed identical mutations in the different microdissected tumors. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these data, it appears that the recurrent bladder tumors originate from the same clone",

    "Title": "Tumor-suppressor effect of interferon regulatory factor-1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) regulates the IFN system, inhibits cell growth, and has tumor-suppressor activities. p21 is a universal cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, the induction of which depends on both p53 and IRF-1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The expression of p21 in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) is regulated by wild-type p53. We examined the expressions of IRF-1 and p21 in 32 HCCs by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and the mutation p53 gene in 32 HCCs by single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. The expression of IRF-1 mRNA in 15 of 32 HCCs was lower than that in adjacent noncancerous tissue. IRF-1 mRNA expression was reduced in 0 of 3 specimens of well-differentiated HCC, 9 of 21 (42%) specimens of moderately differentiated HCC, and 6 of 8 (75%) specimens of poorly differentiated HCC. IRF-1 mRNA expression was significantly lower in tumors with portal thrombus than in those without portal thrombus (P = 0.003). p53 mutations were detected in 7 of 32 HCCS: p21 expression was reduced in 6 of the 7 (86%) HCCs with p53 mutations. In contrast, p21 expression was reduced in 13 of 25 (52%) HCCs with wild-type p53. IRF-1 expression was reduced in 7 of 13 (53%) HCCs with both wild-type p53 and reduced expression of p21. These results suggest that IRF-1 may be a tumor-suppressor gene for HCC and that IRF-1 is related to p21 expression in HCC with wild-type p53",

    "Title": "Prognostic value of p53 mutations in patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: A significant correlation has been found between p53 mutation and response to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. To determine the prognostic value of p53 mutation in patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy, p53 mutation was analyzed using the biopsied specimens taken for diagnosis. METHODS: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy was performed for 40 patients with severe dysphagia caused by esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with T3 or T4 disease. Chemotherapy consisted of protracted infusion of 5-fluorouracil, combined with an infusion of cisplatinum. Radiation treatment of the mediastinum was administered concomitantly with chemotherapy. The p53 gene mutation was detected by fluorescence-based polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) methods. DNA sequences were determined for DNA fragments with shifted peaks by SSCP methods. RESULTS: Of the 40 patients, 15 had T3 disease and 25 had T4 disease; 11 patients had M1 lymph node (LYM) disease. Of the 40 patients, 13 (33%) achieved a complete response. The median survival time was 14 months, and the 2-year survival rate was 20%. Among the 40 tumor samples, p53 mutation was detected in 24 tumors (60%). The survival rate in the 24 patients with p53 mutation did not differ significantly from that in the 16 patients without p53 mutation. In contrast, the 15 patients with T3 disease survived longer than the 25 patients with T4 disease (P = 0.016); however, the survival rate in the 11 patients with M1 LYM disease did not differ significantly from that in the 29 patients without M1 LYM disease. CONCLUSION: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is potentially curative for locally advanced esophageal carcinoma, but p53 genetic abnormality has no impact on prognosis",

    "Title": "Genetic analysis of a local recurrent tumor after colonic polypectomy",
    "Abstract": "After polypectomy, the cut end of the polyp is usually examined by light microscopy to assess the risk of recurrent cancer. Here, we report a recurrent tumor that appeared in the colon 6 years after polypectomy, although cancer cells were not observed in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of the cut end of the primary polyp. Retrospectively, the primary polyp and the recurrent tumor were analyzed for mutations of the p53 gene. We detected p53 mutations in the primary polyp, even in the cut end of the polyp. The same set of two p53 mutations was detected in the recurrent tumor. These observations indicate a common origin of the primary tumor and the recurrent tumor. We conclude that it is important to analyze p53 mutations in colonic polyps, especially when the cut end of the polyp is difficult to evaluate histologically, in order to predict recurrence",

    "Abstract": "Background and Purpose: TP53 gene-mutation and expression of p53 have been described to influence the radiosensitivity of tumour cells from head and neck carcinomas. The present study was performed to evaluate whether TP53 mutation may influence the clinical outcome of head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy or surgery.Materials and methods: DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections from primary biopsies taken before radiotherapy. Gene mutations (in exons 5-9) were identified using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) as the initial scanning procedure and characterized by sequencing. Patients were treated with primary radiotherapy or surgery alone. Treatment was given according to the DAHANCA schedules with 5 or 6 weekly fractions (2 Gy) of radiotherapy (66-68 Gy). Most patients were also treated with the hypoxic radiosensitizer Nimorazole. The results are reported as 5-year actuarial values, and differences estimated by log-rank analysis.Results: The present analysis is based on 114 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, pharynx and oral cavity diagnosed between March 1992 and October 1996. Ninety patients received primary radiotherapy alone and 21 were treated with surgery. TP53 mutations were found in 45 patients (39%) and in patients receiving radiotherapy, TP53 mutation was highly associated with poor prognosis. Loco-regional control rates (5-year actuarial values) for TP53 mutation was 29 vs. 54% for TP53 wildtype (P&lt;0.01). For disease-free survival the corresponding values were 13 and 38% (P&lt;0.01), respectively. The correlations were not found to be related to specific subtypes of mutations (e.g. missense mutations affecting DNA-contact or Zn-binding regions) but rather to the presence of any mutation at all. In contrast, TP53 mutation did not influence the response to surgery.Conclusions: A strong relationship was observed between TP53 mutation and poor prognosis (increased risk of loco-regional failure and death) in head and neck cancer patients given primary radiotherapy but not surgery",

A hemicolectomy was performed, and the tumor specimen was prepared for DNA-analysis and immunohistochemical screening. We found a mutation of p53 gene without APC- and ras-gene alteration and expression of erbB2-protooncogen. The polyps in non- hereditary Cronkhite-Canada-syndrom are neither adenomatous nor hyperplastic, but patients often develop colorectal cancers. The steps of mutation do not follow the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, first described by Vogelstein 1988. This and previous observations suggest that carcinogenesis in Cronkhite-Canada syndrome follows another independent sequence",

    "Title": "Colloid (mucinous noncystic) carcinoma of the pancreas",
    "Abstract": "In the past, colloid (mucinous noncystic) carcinoma (CC) of the pancreas had been included under the category of ordinary ductal adenocarcinoma, a tumor with a dismal prognosis, or was frequently misdiagnosed as mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. The clinicopathologic features of CC have not yet been well characterized, because most cases on record have been parts of studies on either mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) or intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), with which colloid carcinomas are frequently associated. To determine the clinicopathologic characteristics of CC, 17 pancreatic tumors composed predominantly (&gt;80%) of CC (defined as nodular extracellular mucin lakes with scanty malignant epithelial cells) and in which the invasive carcinoma measured larger than 1 cm were studied. Ten of these were originally classified as mucinous ductal adenocarcinoma and four as mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. The mean age of the patients was 61 years; 9 were men and 8 were women. The mean size of the CC was 5.3 cm (range, 1.2-16 cm). In more than half of the patients, CC represented the invasive component of an IPMN (in nine cases) or MCN (in one case). The tumors were composed of well-defined pools of mucin with sparse malignant cells in various patterns of distribution. Signet-ring cells floating in the mucin (but not as individual cells infiltrating stroma, a characteristic finding of signet-ring cell adenocarcinomas) were commonly identified and were prominent in five cases. Perineurial invasion was noted in six cases and regional lymph node metastases in eight. Mutation in codon 12 of the k-ras gene was detected in only 4 of 12 cases studied and p53 mutation in 2 of 9. Immunohistochemical and histochemical mucin stains suggested luminalization of the basal aspects of the cells. Five-year survival was 57%. At an overall mean follow up of 57 months, 10 patients were alive with no evidence of disease (median, 79 mos), including four with lymph node metastasis, three others with perineurial invasion, and another with vascular invasion. Four patients died of disease (18, 18, 25, and 26 mos), and three died of thromboembolism (with persistent disease) at 2, 5, 10 months. All seven patients who died with or of tumor had undergone incisional biopsy of the tumor either before the operation or intraoperatively, whereas none of the patients who were alive had incisional biopsy. When compared with 82 cases of resectable ordinary ductal adenocarcinoma on whom follow-up and staging information was complete, it was found that the patients with CC present with larger tumors (p = 0.03) but lower stage (p = 0.01). The prognosis of CC is significantly better: 2-year and 5-year survival are 70% versus 28% and 57% versus 12%, respectively (p = 0.001). In conclusion, pancreatic CC may occur with or without an identifiable IPMN and MCN component, and should be distinguished from mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, ordinary ductal adenocarcinoma, and signet-ring cell adenocarcinoma. CC of the pancreas is associated with a significantly better prognosis than ordinary ductal adenocarcinoma. In addition to its distinctive morphologic and clinical characteristics, CC of the pancreas also appears to have a low incidence of mutation in codon 12 of the k-ras gene. In cases with a clinical suspicion of colloid carcinoma, the possibility that an incisional biopsy may contribute to thromboembolic complications or even dissemination of the tumor may need to be considered. The luminalization of the basal aspects of the tumor cells may be the cause of stromal mucin accumulation that characterizes colloid carcinoma and may act as a containing factor",

    "Abstract": "The authors studied 46 primary gastric lymphomas for expression of the p53 gene by immunohistochemistry and screened for mutations in p53 exon 5-8 by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism. Twenty-five specimens cases were also analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosomal region 17p12-13.1. In 36 lymphomas negative for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, of which 29 were of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type, p53 genetic changes were found in 47.2% but correlated poorly with overexpression. Only 20% of the mutations involved exon 7. There were recurrent mutations of intron 7, intron 6, and exon 6. In contrast, the 10 EBV- positive cases, none of MALT type, had a much higher rate of mutation, and all showed both p53 overexpression and p53 mutation and/or LOH, and 87.5% had mutations involving exon 7. Four of these involved codon 242, not seen in the EBV-negative group. Splicing mutations of intron 8 were seen in three specimens, two involving the same nucleotide position. In four of five specimens, LOH analysis identified microsatellite instability, allelic loss, or both. The Helicobacter pylori infection rate in the EBV-positive group (20%) was much lower than in the EBV- negative group (91.7%). These differences between the two groups suggest involvement of different carcinogens. Mutation of codon 242 has not been specifically associated with other tumors and may represent a mutational hot spot in the EBV-positive lymphomas",

    "Title": "Prognostic significance of K-ras and TP53 mutations in the role of adjuvant chemotherapy on survival in patients with Dukes C colon cancer",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Mutations in K-ras and TP53 genes are common in colorectal cancer. They affect biologic behavior and might influence chemotherapy susceptibility in these tumors. We investigated whether the survival of patients with Dukes C colon cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy is influenced by K-ras and TP53 mutations. METHODS: Mutation screening of the hot spots of the K-ras gene and of the evolutionarily conserved regions of the TP53 gene was performed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of 55 consecutive patients with Dukes C colon cancer treated with adjuvant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 47 (range, 32-66) months. RESULTS: Alterations in the mutation hot spots of K-ras were found at codon 12 (n = 11) and 13 (n = 4) in 15 of the 55 carcinomas (27 percent). No mutation was found at codon 61. Mutations of a probably causative nature in the evolutionarily conserved regions (exons 5-8) of the TP53 gene were found in 24 tumors (44 percent). K-ras and TP53 mutations were found equally in the group with recurrent disease (7/26 (26 percent) and 12/27 (44 percent), respectively) and in the group without recurrences (8/28 (24 percent) and 12/28 (43 percent), respectively). Cancer-specific survival did not differ significantly between patients with K-ras or TP53 or both mutated and nonmutated tumors, respectively (log-rank test: K-ras, P = 0.72 and TP53, P = 0.77; K-ras and TP53, P = 0.8). Also, potentially aggressive K-ras codon 12 and 13 mutations had the same survival as tumors without these mutations (log-rank test; P = 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with K-ras or TP53 or both mutated Dukes C colon tumors have the same survival as nonmutated tumors when treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. These data suggest that mutations in K-ras or TP53 alone are not prognostic indicators in patients with Dukes C colon cancer receiving adjuvant 5-Fluorouracil-based therapy",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the roles of the CDKN1C (P57KIP2) gene, which encodes for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDNC, and the TP53 tumor suppressor gene in adrenal tumorigenesis, as a means of investigating the molecular basis of sporadic adrenal tumors, which is unknown. DESIGN: Screening for the presence CDKN1C and TP53 mutations and analyzing the expression pattern of CDNC, P53 and its downstream effector CDN1 (P21WAF1/CIP1) in a series of 79 sporadic adrenal tumors. METHODS: Single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing were used for mutation analysis of CDKN1C and TP53 in blood and adrenal tissue samples. In a subgroup of 48 tissues, CDKN1C expression was evaluated by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical analysis of P53 and CDN1 was performed. RESULTS: No somatic mutations of CDKN1C were found in the tumors analyzed, in spite of low/absent CDNC expression in adrenocortical adenomas and carcinomas. Mutations in the TP53 gene were present in 70% of adrenocortical carcinomas, associated with abnormal P53 and CDN1 expression, but not in benign neoplasms. In the normal adrenal cortex, CDNC expression was strictly nuclear and confined to the cortical zone (i.e. zona glomerulosa and reticularis), with no staining in the medulla. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the TP53 gene are frequent in adrenocortical carcinomas and might be used as a marker of malignancy. In the normal adrenal cortex, the zone- specific pattern of expression of CDNC suggests a role in adrenal differentiation",

    "Abstract": "Background &amp; Aims: To evaluate how characterization of genetic alterations can help in the elucidation of liver carcinogenesis pathways, 137 tumors were analyzed. Methods: High-density allelotype, p53, Axin1, and beta-catenin gene mutations were determined. Alterations were analyzed according to clinical parameters. Results: Tumors could be divided into 2 groups according to chromosome stability status. In the first group, demonstrating a chromosome stability, beta-catenin mutation associated with chromosome 8p losses were frequently found as the single genetic alterations. beta-catenin mutations were associated with large tumor size and with negative hepatitis B virus status. In the second group, demonstrating a chromosome instability, the most frequent allelic losses were on chromosome 1p, 4q, 6q, 9p, 13q, 16p, 16q, and 17p; Axin1 and p53 were frequently mutated. All of these alterations, except losses on 6q and 9p, were associated with hepatitis B virus infection. P53 mutations, 17p, 13q losses, and a high value of the fractional allelic loss index were associated with poor differentiated tumors, independently of risk factors. Finally, in the whole series, chromosome 9p and 6q losses were associated with poor prognosis. Conclusions: Two main pathways defined by genetic alterations show different risk factors and clinical characteristics. Furthermore, loss of chromosome 9p or 6q is an independent prognostic indicator",

Eight cases of endoscopically resected colorectal intramucosal carcinomas were analyzed to determine the p53 gene sequence (exons 5 to 8). Six out of 8 cases showed p53 gene mutations, and in all of them, the mutational status was heterogeneous. In 4 cases, mutated codons were heterogeneous as well. These data indicate that p53 gene alterations in colorectal carcinomas occur and diverge at the stage of intramucosal carcinoma, supporting our previously proposed hypothesis that colorectal carcinomas can be composed of various subclones as regards p53 gene mutation, while the carcinoma is limited to the mucosa, and one of these subclones commences invasion to the submucosa after clonal selection, thus generating a monoclonal invasive carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Two cases of ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated carcinoma or dysplasia and morphologically non-neoplastic mucosa with p53 protein overexpression (MNNM-p53OE) were selected. DNA was extracted from the paraffin blocks of these lesions and exons 5 - 8 of the p53 gene were analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing. In addition, mutations in K-ras codon 12 were analyzed by PCR-RFLP methods. MNNM-p53OE was located surrounding and adjoining a coexisting carcinoma and / or dysplasia. A p53 mutation was detected in 12 / 22 (54.5%) MNNM-p53OE samples, 4 / 8 (50%) dysplasia samples and 8 / 8 (100%) carcinoma samples. The p53 mutations detected in MNNM-p53OE were identical to those demonstrated in the adjoining carcinoma and / or dysplasia. No K-ras codon 12 mutation was detected in any of the samples. These results indicate that MNNM-p53OE may share an identical clonal linkage with a coexisting carcinoma and / or dysplasia, and may be an initial and submorphological form of UC-associated neoplasia. Recognition of MNNM-p53OE in biopsy specimens may help to identify patients with UC at risk of developing colorectal carcinoma",

We analyzed the status of the Rb, p53, p15INK4B, p16INK4A and p14ARF genes in these diseases by Southern blot, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and western blot analysis. We used 31 NK cell neoplasms, including four cell lines derived from NK cell neoplasms, 3 myeloid / NK cell precursor acute leukemias, 4 blastic NK cell lymphoma / leukemias, 4 aggressive NK cell leukemia / lymphomas, 4 nasal NK cell lymphomas, and 12 chronic NK lymphocytosis. We found gene amplification of the p53 gene in one nasal NK cell lymphoma, and point mutations of the p53 gene in one blastic NK cell lymphoma / leukemia and one chronic NK lymphocytosis. In addition, homozygous deletions of p15, p16 and p14 genes in 5 out of 31 samples were detected; 3 were from nasal NK cell lymphoma and 2 from blastic NK cell lymphoma / leukemia. Also hemizygous deletion of the Rb gene in one blastic NK cell lymphoma was detected. Rb proteins were highly expressed in one cell line as well as two myeloid / NK cell precursor acute leukemias. In other cell lines, complete loss and an aberrant migration pattern of Rb protein expression were observed. Comparative genomic hybridization suggested that the homozygous deletions of the p15, p16 and p14 were subtle chromosomal deletions and could not be identified by standard karyotyping in some cases. Although the number of cases we analyzed was not large, alterations identified in the Rb, p53, p16, p15 and p14 genes are of significance and might be associated with tumorigenesis in NK cell neoplasms",

    "Abstract": "A case of polypoid tumor of the esophagus consisting of a sarcomatous tumor partly covered with superficial squamous cell carcinoma is described. The sarcomatous component consisted of anaplastic spindle and pleomorphic tumor cells that mimicked malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH). Both the sarcomatous and carcinomatous components were positive for p53 immunohistochemically. Further molecular analysis revealed that the two components had the same somatic mutation in the p53 gene. These results suggest a monoclonal origin of this biphasic tumor",

    "Title": "p53 protein expression and gene mutation in phyllodes tumors of the breast",
    "Abstract": "The malignant potential of mammary phyllodes tumors is difficult to assess on initial pathologic examination. Studies on the p53 tumor suppressor gene have shown that it has an important role in the development of a variety of malignancies, yet the specific contribution to the pathogenesis and development of the malignant potential of phyllodes tumor is largely unknown. We studied p53 protein expression in 25 cases of phyllodes tumors histologically classified as either malignant (12 cases) or benign (13 cases). Using microdissection approach, we also analyzed the p53 gene sequence in a case that demonstrated progression from benign to malignant phenotype. Nuclear p53 staining was detected in various proportions (1-90%) of neoplastic stromal cells of malignant tumors. No staining was found in benign tumors. Progression from benign to malignant phenotype was associated with a significant increase in the accumulation of p53 (more than 20 times). This was caused by an underlying missense mutation in exon 7, resulting in a change from Arg248 to Trp248 in the malignant component of the tumor. Stromal p53 over-expression was observed only in neoplasms histologically classified as malignant and was associated with an increased proliferation index (MIB-1 staining). These two markers may be used as useful adjuncts in the diagnosis of malignancy in difficult cases or when only a limited sample size is available. Somatic mutation in exon 7 of p53 gene in malignant phyllodes tumor points toward the importance of p53 in the malignant transformation of phyllodes tumors",

    "Title": "Relationship between tumor suppressor gene p53 and tumors of adipose tissue",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between p53 gene and tumors of adipose tissue at the level of protein and gene. METHODS: Immunohistochemical LSAB, PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing were used in 82 cases. RESULTS: p53 protein is expressed only in liposarcomas, in which the positive staining rate was 48.08% (25/52). In different subtypes of liposarcomas, the positive staining rate in well differentiated liposarcomas was 30.00% (9/30), which is much lower than that of the poorly differentiated liposarcomas (P < 0.005). Abnormality in the single-stranded DNA pattern was determined in 2 samples (pleomophic liposarcomas) by PCR-SSCP analysis. Missense mutations in exon 8 codon 268 of p53 gene (AAC-->ATC) were detected by DNA sequencing. Another heterozygotic cosense mutation may exist at exon 6 codon 221 of p53 gene (GAG-->GAA). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the p53 protein has a relationship with development, differentiation and malignancy of liposarcoma. Detecting the level of p53 protein expression may be valuable in evaluating the level of differentiation and malignancy of liposarcoma. There appear point mutation on exon 8, 6 of p53 gene",

    "Abstract": "Ultraviolet light exposure is the major risk factor for the development of squamous cell carcinoma in Caucasians. Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 have been identified in both squamous cell carcinomas and basal cell carcinomas. The human homolog of the Drosophila patched gene, has been shown to be mutated in sporadic basal cell carcinomas; however, mutations in the patched gene have not been found in squamous cell carcinoma. In this study, we screened a total of 20 squamous cell carcinoma samples for mutations in the patched gene. Using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism as an initial screening method, we identified one non-sense mutation, two mis-sense mutations and three silent mutations in five squamous cell carcinoma samples. In one squamous cell carcinoma sample, we identified a tandem GG--&gt;AA transitional change at nucleotide 3152 in exon 18 of the patched gene that resulted in a premature stop codon at codon 1051. The three squamous cell carcinoma samples containing non-sense and mis-sense mutations were isolated from individuals with histories of multiple basal cell carcinoma. Sequence analysis of the p53 gene in these five squamous cell carcinoma samples identified one CC--&gt;TT and three C--&gt;T ultraviolet-specific nucleotide changes. Our study provides evidence that the patched gene is mutated in squamous cell carcinoma from individuals with a history of multiple basal cell carcinoma. The identification of ultraviolet-specific nucleotide changes in both tumor suppressor genes supports the notion that ultraviolet exposure plays an important part in the development of squamous cell carcinoma",

    "Title": "Ultraviolet exposure as the main initiator of p53 mutations in basal cell carcinomas from psoralen and ultraviolet A-treated patients with psoriasis",
    "Abstract": "Basal cell carcinoma, the most frequent skin cancer in humans, is often linked to chronic sun exposure. In psoralen and ultraviolet A-treated psoriatic patients, basal cell carcinomas may occur even more frequently; however, the exact etiology and mechanisms of tumorigenesis in psoriatic patients are unclear because psoralen and ultraviolet A is not only a carcinogen but also an immunosuppressor and because psoralen and ultraviolet A-treated psoriatic patients often have other (co)carcinogenic risk factors (e.g, therapeutic exposure to ultraviolet B, X-ray radiation, arsenic, tar, and/or chemotherapeutic agents such as methotrexate). In this study, we analyzed the DNA of 13 basal cell carcinomas from five psoralen and ultraviolet A-treated psoriatic patients for mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. DNA sequencing revealed a total of 11 mis-sense, two non-sense, and four silent mutations in seven of the 13 basal cell carcinomas (54%). Of the 13 total mis-sense or non-sense mutations, 12 (92%) occurred at dipyrimidine sites and nine (69%) were of the ultraviolet fingerprint type (eight C-->T transitions and one CC-->TT transition). Three of the C-->T transitions occurred at dipyrimidine sites opposite a 5'-TpG sequence (a potential psoralen-binding site and target for psoralen and ultraviolet A mutagenesis). Thus, whether these mutations were induced by ultraviolet or psoralen and ultraviolet A was not clear. In addition, two other mutations (15%) occurred at 5'-TpG sites, one (8%) occurred at a 5'-TpA site (the most frequent site of psoralen binding and mutagenesis in cell and murine studies), and one (8%) involved a G-- >T transversion. These results suggest that (i) the major initiator of p53 mutations in basal cell carcinoma in psoralen and ultraviolet A- treated psoriasis patients is environmental and/or therapeutic ultraviolet(B) exposure, and that (ii) psoralen and ultraviolet A itself causes only a smaller portion of p53 mutations in psoralen and ultraviolet A-associated basal cell carcinomas",

    "Title": "Detecting Colorectal Cancer in Stool With the Use of Multiple Genetic Targets",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer cells are shed into the stool, providing a potential means for the early detection of the disease using noninvasive approaches. Our goal was to develop reliable, specific molecular genetic tests for the detection of colorectal cancer in stool samples. METHODS: Stool DNA was isolated from paired stools and primary tumor samples from 51 colorectal cancer patients. Three genetic targets-TP53, BAT26, and K-RAS-were used to detect tumor-associated mutations in the stool prior to or without regard to the molecular analyses of the paired tumors. TP53 gene mutations were detected with a mismatch-ligation assay that detects nine common p53 gene mutations. Deletions within the BAT26 locus were detected by a modified solid-phase minisequencing method. Mutations in codons 12 and 13 of K-RAS were detected with a digital polymerase chain reaction-based method. RESULTS: TP53 gene mutations were detected in the tumor DNA of 30 patients, all of whom had the identical TP53 mutation in their stools. Tumors from three patients contained a noninherited deletion at the BAT26 locus, and the same alterations were identified in these patients' stool specimens. Nineteen of 50 tumors tested had a K-RAS mutation; identical mutations were detected in the paired stool DNA samples from eight patients. In no case was a mutation found in stool that was not also present in the primary tumor. Thus, the three genetic markers together detected 36 (71%) of 51 patients (95% confidence interval [CI] = 56% to 83%) with colorectal cancer and 36 (92%) of 39 patients (95% CI = 79% to 98%) whose tumors had an alteration. CONCLUSION: We were able to detect the majority of colorectal cancers by analyzing stool DNA for just three genetic markers. Additional work is needed to determine the specificity of these genetic tests for detecting colorectal neoplasia in asymptomatic patients and to more precisely estimate the prevalence of the mutations and sensitivity of the assay",

    "Title": "p53 missense mutations in microdissected high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: To understand the role of sporadic mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 (also known as TP53) in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, it is important to identify at which histologic stage such mutations first occur. We previously showed that a p53 mutation present in invasive breast cancer was found in all surrounding areas of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) but not in areas of hyperplasia or normal breast epithelium. In the present investigation, we studied patients with DCIS, but without invasive breast cancer, to determine the spectrum of DCIS types that can harbor a p53 mutation. METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 94 patients with DCIS were evaluated histologically for the predominant cellular architectural pattern, degree of necrosis, and nuclear grade. Each specimen was also assigned an overall histologic grade (with the use of the Van Nuys Prognostic Index pathologic classification). Tissue specimens were stained immunohistochemically with an anti-p53 antibody. Positively stained tissue areas were analyzed for the presence of p53 mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: DCIS from 10 of 94 patients were found to contain p53 missense mutations. All 10 were of a solid or a comedo histologic pattern and contained cells of nuclear grade 2 or 3 (i.e., more abnormal nuclei). The frequency of p53 missense mutations was statistically significantly different among the three overall histologic grade categories (zero [0%] of 49 with low-grade DCIS, one [4.35%] of 23 with intermediate-grade DCIS, and nine [40.9%] of 22 with high-grade DCIS; df = 2 and P&lt;.0001). CONCLUSION: The DCIS types in patients in this series are representative of clinically detected DCIS. Our finding that p53 mutations can occur before the development of invasive breast cancer, particularly in DCIS of high histologic grade, has potentially important implications for prevention and treatment",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Survival of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma is highly variable. Prognostic markers would thus be useful to identify clinical subsets of such patients. Because specific genetic alterations have been associated with glioblastoma, we investigated whether similar genetic alterations could be detected in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma and used to identify those with particularly aggressive disease. METHODS: Tissue specimens were collected from 174 patients enrolled in Mayo Clinic Cancer Center and North Central Cancer Treatment Group clinical trials for newly diagnosed gliomas, including 63 with anaplastic astrocytoma and 111 with glioblastoma multiforme. Alterations of the EGFR, PTEN, and p53 genes and of chromosomes 7 and 10 were examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction, and DNA sequencing. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Mutation of PTEN, amplification of EGFR, and loss of the q arm of chromosome 10 were statistically significantly less common in anaplastic astrocytoma than in glioblastoma multiforme (P =.033, P =.001, and P<.001, respectively), and mutation of p53 was statistically significantly more common (P<.001). Univariate survival analyses of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma identified PTEN (P =.002) and p53 (P =.012) mutations as statistically significantly associated with reduced and prolonged survival, respectively. Multivariate Cox analysis of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma showed that PTEN mutation remained a powerful prognostic factor after adjusting for patient age, on-study performance score, and extent of tumor resection (hazard ratio = 4.34; 95% confidence interval = 1.82 to 10.34). Multivariate classification and regression-tree analysis of all 174 patients identified EGFR amplification as an independent predictor of prolonged survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme who were older than 60 years of age. CONCLUSION: PTEN mutation and EGFR amplification are important prognostic factors in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma and in older patients with glioblastoma multiforme, respectively",

    "Title": "p53 Mutations and microsatellite instability in ovarian cancer: Yin and yang",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that p53 frameshift mutations in ovarian cancer occur as a result of genomic instability rather than as a proximal cause of this process. STUDY DESIGN: Sequencing of the p53 tumor suppressor gene has been carried out on 305 ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers. Two groups of p53 null mutations were identified: (1) those caused by frameshift insertion or deletion mutations (n = 31) and (2) those caused by nonsense mutations (n = 28). As a control group 59 tumors with p53 missense mutations were selected by matching with the p53 null tumors on the basis of patient age at diagnosis, stage and grade of cancer, cancer site, and year of diagnosis. Microsatellite instability was determined from paired normal and tumor tissue deoxyribonucleic acid by means of the following different markers: D2S123, D5S346, D17S250, BAT25, and BAT26. Amplimers from polymerase chain reactions were evaluated on 7% polyacrylamide gels. RESULTS: The p53 null tumors were more likely to be of higher stage and grade. Fallopian tube cancers were more common (P =.02) in the p53 frameshift group. The overall incidence of microsatellite instability was 39%, 36%, and 25% for tumors with p53 frameshift nonsense and missense mutations (P =.30). Microsatellite instability was seen almost exclusively with ovarian cancer (P =.04). CONCLUSIONS: Microsatellite instability is a relatively common event in ovarian cancer and is dependent on marker selection. The p53 frameshift mutations do not appear to occur as a consequence of genomic instability",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Abnormal protein expression and gene mutation should be examined on exactly identified lesions. To perform simultaneous analyses of oncogene or tumor suppressor gene mutations and related protein expression in single histologic sections, we have developed a novel method using an antigen-retrieval solution for a polymerase chain reaction template before immunohistochemical staining. METHODS: Using 20 cases of sporadic colorectal carcinoma, several kinds of antigen-retrieval solutions were tested after heating rehydrated, 4-microm-thick, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded histologic sections at 96 degrees C for 20 minutes. Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis was conducted for p53 (exons 5 through 9) and K-ras (exons 1 and 2), and the histologic sections were then immunostained with monoclonal antibody against p53. RESULTS: DNA analysis of antigen-retrieval solutions was possible in all 20 cases and revealed completely consistent results (100%) with fresh cancer tissue and microdissected cancer tissue of paraffin-embedded histologic sections. With this method, K-ras mutations were positive in 10 of 20 cases (exon 1 in 9 cases and exon 2 in 1 case) and p53 mutations were positive in 9 of 20 cases (exon 5 in 4 cases, exon 6 in 1, exon 7 in 3, and exon 8 in 1 case), with 8 of the 9 p53 mutation cases showing diffuse p53 protein expression on immunostaining. Base alterations of all abnormal conformers were confirmed with direct sequencing. For polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) was found to be the optimal antigen-retrieval solution. CONCLUSIONS: This newly developed method can be used for routine immunostaining and genetic analysis with single histologic sections",

    "Abstract": "Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines have been important in vitro models for studying the pathogenesis of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and for exploring new treatment strategies. A new EBV(-) Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (GA- 10) was established from a patient with a clinically aggressive, chemorefractory BL and characterized. Although functional p- glycoprotein could not be demonstrated by dye-efflux assays, both p53 genes were mutated in the GA-10 cells, perhaps contributing to the resistant phenotype of the original neoplasm. Two properties of BL cells which may be useful targets for novel cytotoxic therapeutics are their surface expression of CD77, the receptor for Shiga toxin (Stx), and their high rate of proliferation. Expression of CD77 on the GA-10 cells was heterogeneous in that certain subclones expressed high levels of CD77 and correspondingly exhibited strong growth inhibition by Stx while others showed low levels of CD77 expression and weak Stx-induced growth inhibition. Flavopiridol, a potent inhibitor of cell cycle progression through G1 and G2, induced cytotoxicity of the GA-10 cells with an LC(50) of approximately 40 nM vs 70 nM for HL-60 cells (P < 0.05). The concentrations of flavopiridol at which only 10% of the cells were viable (LC(10)) were approximately 280 nM for the GA-10 cells and 520 nM for the HL-60 cells (P < 0.05). Dose-related induction of apoptosis in response to flavopiridol was demonstrated in the GA-10 cells by morphology, TUNEL assay, and activation of caspase-3. Flavopiridol was also cytotoxic to seven other BL cell lines tested. These data suggest that flavopiridol may have therapeutic value in the treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma",

The HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 are thought to play a crucial role in this process through their interactions with the p53 protein and the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product pRb, respectively. E6 binds to p53 protein promoting its degradation. This is considered to contribute to the oncogenesis of HPV-associated anogenital cancer. On the other hand, in HPV-negative cervical carcinoma, p53 mutations are thought to have a role in the transformation process. A total of 122 HPV-positive cervical carcinoma tissue samples were evaluated for the presence of mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene by single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. Only four missense point mutations were detected. These findings suggest that other mechanisms independent of p53 inactivation may play a role in the genesis of cervical carcinomas",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 gene are the most common genetic alteration in malignant human tumors. A cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21WAF1/CIP1, is thought to be an important mediator of p53-induced cell cycle arrest. Although numerous studies have reported p53 expression and mutation in colorectal cancer few of them have correlated p53 expression with that of its downstream effector p21 and with the proliferation index as measured by expression of the Ki67 nuclear antigen. We studied p53, p21 and Ki67 expression by immunohistochemistry and molecular biology in 35 colorectal carcinomas. We compared these findings with each other and with clinical factors. Sixty three percent of tumors expressed p53 whereas seventy one percent expressed p21WAF1/CIP1. In adenocarcinomas, p21 staining was heterogeneous: p21-reactive cells were seen in the most differentiated areas. There was no correlation between p21WAF1/CIP1 and p53 expression, p53 mutation, Ki67 expression or clinical factors such as sex or location of the tumor. On the other hand, there was a statistical relationship between p21 expression and survival: our results indicated an association between high p21 expression and lower stages p21WAF1/CIP1 appears to be induced independently of p53 in these tumors and may be associated with differentiation rather than proliferation",

    "Abstract": "Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is an uncommon but aggressive type of endometrial carcinoma that is frequently associated with extrauterine disease despite minimal or no myometrial invasion. The origin of the extrauterine tumors in this setting remains controversial. The majority of USCs (90%) and endometrial intraepithelial carcinomas (78%), the putative precursor of USC, have p53 mutations, suggesting that p53 alterations occur early in the pathogenesis of USC. To determine if the extrauterine tumors associated with minimally invasive USC and endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (EIC) represent metastases or multifocal primary tumors, we examined the mutational pattern of the p53 gene in 3 cases of minimally invasive USC and 1 case of EIC and in the corresponding extrauterine tumors associated with each of the cases. In all 4 cases, the primary tumors and the associated extrauterine tumor foci had identical p53 mutations. Our results support the premise that extrauterine serous tumors found in association with EIC or minimally invasive USC represent a unifocal process and thus are early metastases",

    "Abstract": "Twenty-six gastric carcinoma and matching normal tissue DNAs, which had previously been analyzed for alterations of the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) and MCC (mutated in colorectal cancer) genes were further investigated for the following genetic alterations: mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the p53 gene, replication error (RER) and LOH at 12 microsatellite repeat loci, and mutation of the hMSH2 gene. In addition, 9 of the 26 gastric carcinomas were analyzed for genetic alterations using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Somatic mutations of the p53 gene were found to be frequent being detected in 31% of gastric carcinomas while LOH at the p53 locus was observed in 37.5% of informative cases. Loss of wild type p53 allele was detected in the majority (7 of 8) tumors found to be harboring a mutation. In the hMSH2 gene, an intronic 4 base pair insertion at 31 base pairs upstream of the beginning of exon 13 was detected in both tumor and normal tissue from one gastric carcinoma case. RER was detected in 11.5% of gastric carcinomas, at one or more microsatellite repeat loci. Of the 12 microsatellite repeat loci analyzed LOH was most frequently observed at D22S351 (30% informative cases) suggesting that a tumor suppressor gene on 22q may be important in gastric carcinogenesis. In support of this, CGH analysis carried out on 9 of the gastric carcinomas identified loss of chromosome 22 in 5 of these tumors",

    "Title": "Characterisation of molecular alterations in microdissected archival gliomas",
    "Abstract": "Classification of gliomas according to their molecular characteristics may be important in future histopathological diagnosis. However, gliomas frequently display heterogeneity at the histological, biological and molecular level. In this study of archival diagnostic gliomas, precision microdissection was used to enrich samples in the most malignant cells or to investigate intratumoural histological heterogeneity. Analysis of tumour samples microdissected from the most aggressive regions, representative of the histopathological diagnosis, revealed PTEN mutations in 4/14 anaplastic astrocytomas, 4/13 glioblastomas and 1 gliosarcoma, but not in 19 low-grade gliomas. Using a novel PCR procedure and direct sequence analysis of the entire coding sequence, TP53 mutations were detected in 1/3 pilocytic astrocytomas, 3/13 astrocytomas, 4/14 anaplastic astrocytomas, 5/13 glioblastomas and 1 gliosarcoma. All but one of the tumours with TP53 mutation showed p53 immunopositivity, but 5 low-grade and 10 high-grade gliomas had p53 protein nuclear accumulation in the absence of detectable mutation. p53 status was unrelated to p21 expression. Neither PTEN nor TP53 mutations influenced the proliferative index or microvessel density of high-grade astrocytomas. Unusual findings include: TP53 mutation in a juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma; TP53 and PTEN mutations in a de novo glioblastoma, a gliosarcoma with identical mutations in gliomatous and sarcomatous components, and an infratentorial anaplastic astrocytoma with an earlier supratentorial grade II astrocytoma bearing the same TP53 mutation but not the PTEN mutation or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 10q23. Similarly, the transition to high-grade histology was associated with acquisition of PTEN mutations and 10q23.3 LOH in two de novo high-grade tumours with regions of low-grade histology",

    "Title": "Molecular genetic alterations in glioblastomas with oligodendroglial component",
    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme is the most malignant astrocytic glioma and usually resistant to chemotherapy. A small fraction of glioblastomas may contain areas with histological features of oligodendroglial differentiation. To determine the molecular genetic alterations in such &quot;glioblastomas with oligodendroglial component&quot;, we investigated 13 of these tumors for genetic alterations and/or expression of the TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, and EGFR genes. In addition, we performed microsatellite analyses for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome arms 1p, 19q and 10q. None of tumors showed evidence for LOH on 10q. LOH on 1p was detected in 3 tumors, 1 of which additionally showed LOH on 19q. The 3 tumors with LOH on 1p showed neither TP53 mutations nor nuclear p53 accumulation. In contrast, 9 of 10 tumors without demonstrated losses on 1p showed nuclear p53 accumulation. TP53 mutations were identified in 3 of these cases. Further aberrations detected were epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression (3 of 13 tumors), homozygous CDKN2A deletion (2 of 11 tumors), and PTEN mutation (1 of 13 tumors). Taken together, our results indicate that &quot;glioblastomas with oligodendroglial component&quot; carry heterogeneous genetic alterations. LOH on 10q, PTEN mutation, and homozygous CDKN2A deletion appear to be less common in these tumors as compared to ordinary glioblastomas. Furthermore, a subset of these tumors demonstrates LOH on 1p, i.e., an alteration that has recently been linked to chemosensitivity and good prognosis in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas",

    "Title": "Genetic alterations of the p14ARF -hdm2-p53 regulatory pathway in breast carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "TP53 is the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancers. The amplification and overexpression of HDM2 plays a role in tumorigenesis via inactivation of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. p14ARF, an alternate transcript of the INK4A tumor suppressor locus, prevents hdm2-induced transcriptional silencing of p53 by binding hdm2. The role of this p14ARF-hdm2-p53 regulatory pathway in breast carcinoma is unknown. We hypothesized that p14ARF mutations and HDM2 gene amplification may be alternative mechanisms of p53 inactivation in breast cancer. Mutational analysis of TP53 (exons 5-9) and exon 1beta of pl4ARF was performed by PCR-SSCP and putative mutations were confirmed by sequencing. p14ARF mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR and the presence of HDM2 gene amplification by differential PCR. Among the cell lines, 7/14 (50%) harbored TP53 mutations and 2/14 (14%) had a deletion ofp14ARF exon 1beta with no detectable p14ARF mRNA. None demonstrated HDM2 gene amplification. TP53 mutations were identified in 7/36 (19%) breast tumors and HDM2 amplification in 2/30 (7%) tumors. All the tumors contained an intact p14ARF exon 1beta with corresponding expression of the mRNA. Alterations in the various components of this regulatory pathway were identified in nine (64%) cell lines and 25% of the 36 breast cancers with TP53 mutation being the predominant aberration. Although p14ARF mutations and HDM2 gene amplification appear to be uncommon events in breast carcinoma, deregulation of this pathway may occur via alternative mechanisms in breast carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Contralateral breast cancer: molecular differentiation between metastasis and second primary cancer",
    "Abstract": "Previous cancer in one breast is a strong known risk factor for cancer in the contralateral breast. Differences in tumor histology and nuclear grading are applied to distinguish between a metastatic spread and a second primary cancer, although cancers of the breast often share the same histological features. Comparison of genetic alterations in paired tumors may provide the most reliable approach for discerning clonal relationships, hence uncovering the presence or absence of multiple primary cancers. We compared tumors from 33 patients with cancer in both breasts for mutations in the p53 gene. With this molecular approach, we were able to define the relationship within paired tumors in 13 patients. The paired tumors of two patients shared the same mutation, revealing the second lesion in one case as a contralateral metachronous lymph node metastasis appearing 29 months after first surgery, and in the other as a spread to the opposite breast. In 11 patients, mutations were either discordant or solely present in one of the lesions, confirming the diagnosis of bilateral breast cancer. Histopathological evaluation had failed to provide firm diagnosis in nine out of 11 instances on account of concordances in pathological parameters such as histological type and grading. In our study, we could show that bilateral breast malignancies most frequently represent two primary breast cancers. We could also demonstrate that contralateral breast cancer spread does occur. Standard pathological assessment allowed a firm diagnosis only in the presence of different histological types",

    "Abstract": "Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is characterized by the presence of intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions composed of whorls of intermediate filaments. This tumor was originally described as an entity of the abortive type of Wilms' tumor in childhood. Recently, it has been proved that these rhabdoid cells can be observed in various types of malignant tumors, including soft tissue sarcoma or carcinoma. To investigate the oncogenesis of this tumor, we examined the p53 gene alteration by means of immunohistochemical analysis and DNA direct sequencing in three cases of malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) of the soft tissue and three cases of MRT of the kidney. All the cases of MRT of the soft tissue and two of the cases of MRT of the kidney showed immunopositivity for p53 protein. Among them, one of the cases of MRT of the soft tissue and two of the cases of MRT of the kidney showed missense mutations of the p53 gene. These results strongly suggest that p53 gene alterations may have an important role to play in the aggressive biological behavior and poor prognosis of this tumor",

    "Title": "P53 mutation and response to hepatic arterial floxuridine in patients with colorectal liver metastases",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To establish the relationship between the number and site of p53 genomic mutations in metastatic colorectal cancer, and the response to hepatic arterial floxuridine. METHODS: Liver metastasis biopsies were collected, at the time of laparotomy for hepatic arterial cannulation. in 28 patients with metachronous colorectal liver metastases. p53 Gene mutations were assessed using reverse transcription, nested polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformational polymorphism and gene sequencing. Chemotherapy response was determined from computerised liver tomograms after 4 months of treatment. RESULTS: Liver metastasis p53 mutation was identified in 21 (75%), and p53 'hot spot' mutation in 11 (39%) patients. There was a significantly lower prevalence (Fisher's, P=0.001) of patients with p53 'hot spot'-mutated liver metastases in stable disease and partial response (5/22) than in progressive (6/6) disease groups. Significantly fewer (Mann-Whitney U, P=0.002) p53 'hot spot' mutations/biopsy were observed in liver metastases from stable disease and partial response (median 0, iqr. 0-0) than in progressive (median 1, iqr 1-2) disease patients. p53 'Hot spot'-mutated liver metastases were associated with significantly shorter survival times (logrank P=0.05) after hepatic arterial floxuridine. Significant response or survival-time differences by total or L2/L3 zinc-binding site p53 mutations were not detected. CONCLUSIONS: The results support a role for p53 'hot spot' mutations in colorectal liver metastasis resistance to fluorinated pyrimidines, and suggest that the presence of such mutations may be a contra-indication to treatment of colorectal liver metastases with hepatic arterial floxuridine",

    "Abstract": "Gene alterations accumulate during the progression of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) to a malignant clone. Here, a new myeloid cell line, designated YSK-21, with the balanced t(8;21)(q22;q22) and the unbalanced der(1)t(1;17)(p36;q21), was established. YSK-21 grows well in a medium containing recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF), or interleukin-3 (rhIL-3). Molecular analysis using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that t(8;21)(q22;q22) resulted in an AML1-MTG8 fusion transcript. FISH and spectral karyotyping (SKY) in conjunction with G-banding analysis revealed a der(1)t(1;17)(p36;q21) chromosomal translocation, which appeared in the clone developed from the original leukemic cells. Molecular analysis of the TP73 gene on 1p36 and the TP53 gene revealed a deletion of one-allele in TP73 with partial demethylation of another allele in the initial clone of YSK, and a point mutation consisting of an A-->T substitution in codon 288 of the TP53 gene in the developed clone of YSK-21. YSK-21 cells, expressing aberrant AML1-MTG8, TP53, and TP73 protein molecules, may be useful for elucidating the pathophysiology of these aberrant proteins and for studying the der(1)t(1;17)(p36;q21) chromosomal translocation",

    "Title": "Second primary glioblastoma",
    "Abstract": "Although characterized by a highly variable phenotype and multiple genetic alterations, glioblastomas are considered monoclonal in origin. We here report on a 64-yr-old patient who developed a second glioblastoma in the left frontal lobe 10 yr after surgical resection of a glioblastoma of right frontal lobe. The first tumor contained 2 p53 mutations, in codon 213 (CGA--&gt;TGA, Arg--&gt;stop) and codon 306 (CGA--&gt;TGA, Arg--&gt;stop), further, 1 missense PTEN mutation (codon 257, TTC--&gt;TTA, Phe--&gt;Leu) and a silent PTEN mutation (codon 154, TTC--&gt;TTT, Phe--&gt;Phe). The second glioblastoma also contained multiple, but different mutations: p53 mutations in codons 158 (CGC--&gt;CAC, Arg--&gt;His) and 273 (CGT--&gt;TGT, Arg--&gt;Cys), and a PTEN mutation in codon 233 (CGA--&gt;TGA, Arg--&gt;Stop). Both neoplasms had a homozygous p16 deletion. The discordant pattern of mutations indicates that the second glioblastoma was not a recurrence but an independent second glioblastoma. The presence in these neoplasms of multiple mutations in tumor suppressor genes suggests the involvement of a novel disease mechanism but there was no indication of a DNA mismatch repair deficiency or of an inherited tumor syndrome",

    "Title": "Glioblastomas with an oligodendroglial component: a pathological and molecular study",
    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is considered by the WHO classification to represent the most malignant grade of the astrocytic tumors. However, a subset of GBM includes recognizable areas with oligodendroglial features, suggesting that some GBM may also have an oligodendroglial origin. The aim of this study was to analyze the molecular profile of GBM associated with an oligodendroglial component (GBMO). We analyzed a series of 25 GBMO. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 1p and 19q, known as common markers of oligodendroglial tumors, were observed in 40% and 60% of cases, respectively; 72% of the tumors displayed one or both of these markers. All but 4 tumors (84%) showed alterations known to be preferentially involved in the progression of astrocytic tumors to GBM, such as EGFR amplification (44%), P16 deletion (48%), LOH on 10q (64%), PTEN (20%), and TP53 (24%) mutations. Therefore, GBMO displayed all the genetic aberrations found in 'standard' GBM with a comparable incidence, but differed from GBM by having a higher rate of LOH on 1p and 19q. These results suggest that GBMO might represent a subgroup of tumors of oligodendroglial origin that is distinct from the 'standard' GBM in terms of tumorigenesis pathway",

    "Title": "Concurrent inactivation of RB1 and TP53 pathways in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas",
    "Abstract": "Oligodendrogliomas are characterized by frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosomes 1p and 19q, but additional genetic alterations are likely to be involved. In this study, we screened 28 oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade II) and 20 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade III) for alterations in the RB1/CDK4/p16INK4a/p15INK4b and TP53/p14ARF/MDM2 pathways. In oligodendrogliomas, hypermethylation of RB1 (1 case) and p14ARF (6 cases) were the only detectable genetic changes (7/28, 25%). In anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, the RB1/CDK4/p16INK4a/p15INK4b signaling pathway regulating the G1 -->3 S transition of the cell cycle was altered in 13/20 (65%) cases, by either RBI alteration, CDK4 amplification, or p16IN4a/p15INK4b homozygous deletion or promoter hypermethylation. Further, 50% (10/20) of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas showed alterations in the TP53 pathway through promoter hypermethylation or homozygous deletion of the p14ARF gene and, less frequently, through TP53 mutation or MDM2 amplification. Of 13 anaplastic astrocytomas with an altered RB1 pathway, 9 (69%) also showed a dysregulated TP53 pathway. Thus, simultaneous disruption of the RB1/CDK4/p16INK4a/p15INK4b and the TP53/p14ARF/MDM2 pathways occurs in 45% (9/20) of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, suggesting that these phenomena contribute to their malignant phenotype",

    "Title": "The spectrum of p53 mutations in colorectal adenomas differs from that in colorectal carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: p53 mutations are frequently observed in colorectal carcinomas but they have also been found in colorectal adenomas, although considerably less frequently. AIMS: To explore p53 mutations in benign tumours, we have screened 70 colorectal adenomas for allelic loss at, and point mutations in, TP53 by analysis of selected microdissected cell populations. RESULTS: Sixteen (22.8%) adenomas were found to have allelic loss, of which 11 (15.7%) had p53 mutations. In adenomas with mild, moderate, or severe dysplasia, mutation or allelic loss occurred in 4.8%, 16.7%, and 52.6%, respectively (p<0.001). Seven different mutations were found, all missense changes or inframe deletions: one (Thr150Arg) has not been found before while three (Gln144His, Gly245Arg, and Glu285Gln) have not been described previously in colorectal tumours. The other three mutations (Arg175Gly, DeltaPro190, and Gly245Ser) have been found in colorectal carcinomas, the last commonly. Adenomas harboured a spectrum of p53 mutations which was significantly different from cancers as regards the position in the gene and a higher frequency of G-->C/C-->G changes. CONCLUSIONS: Combining our data on adenomas with data already published and in comparison with the spectrum of mutations in colorectal carcinomas, it is suggested that some p53 mutations have a weaker effect than others and are therefore more likely to be found in adenomas which have not progressed to carcinomas",

    "Title": "Molecular characteristics of serrated adenomas of the colorectum",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Serrated adenomas (SAs) of the colorectum combine architectural features of hyperplastic polyps and cytological features of classical adenomas. Molecular studies comparing SAs and classical adenomas suggest that each may be a distinct entity; in particular, it has been proposed that microsatellite instability (MSI) distinguishes SAs from classical adenomas and that SAs and the colorectal cancers arising from them develop along a pathway driven by low level microsatellite instability (MSI-L). AIMS: To define the molecular characteristics of SAs of the colorectum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed 39 SAs from 27 patients, including eight SAs from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). We screened these polyps for selected molecular changes, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH) close to APC (5q21) and CRAC1 (15q13-q22), MSI, and mutations of K-ras, APC, p53, and beta-catenin. Expression patterns of beta-catenin, p53, MLH1, MSH2, E-cadherin, and O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Comparative genomic hybridisation was performed on several polyps. RESULTS: MSI was rare (<5% cases) and there was no loss of expression of mismatch repair proteins. Wnt pathway abnormalities (APC mutation/LOH, beta-catenin mutation/nuclear expression) occurred in 11 SAs, including 6/31 (19%) non-FAP tumours. CRAC1 LOH occurred in 23% of tumours. K-ras mutations and p53 mutations/overexpression were found in 15% and 8% of SAs, respectively. Loss of MGMT expression occurred in 18% of polyps and showed a borderline association with K-ras mutations. Aberrant E- cadherin expression was found in seven polyps. Comparative genomic hybridisation detected no gains or deletions of chromosomal material. CONCLUSIONS: The serrated pathway of colorectal tumorigenesis appears to be heterogeneous. In common with classical adenomas, some SAs develop along pathways involving changes in APC/beta-catenin. SAs rarely show MSI or any evidence of chromosomal-scale genetic instability. K-ras mutations may however be less common in SAs than in classical adenomas. Some SAs may harbour changes in the CRAC1 gene. Changes in known genes do not account for the growth of the majority of Sas",

    "Title": "Ataxia telangiectasia mutated-deficient B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia occurs in pregerminal center cells and results in defective damage response and unrepaired chromosome damage",
    "Abstract": "B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a heterogeneous disease involving more than one molecular mechanism that leads to the transformation of CD5(+) B cells at either the pregerminal or postgerminal center stage of differentiation. It was previously demonstrated that ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene mutations can occur in B-CLL and cause a defect in the p53 pathway. Here the role of ATM mutations in the pathogenesis of B-CLL is addressed. Of 50 B-CLL tumors with fully analyzed ATM and TP53, 16 had ATM mutations. Six of 50 B-CLLs showed mutations in TP53 and the remaining 28 tumors had wild- type ATM or TP53. No tumor had both ATM and TP53 mutations. Remarkably, all 16 ATM mutant B-CLLs showed the absence of somatic variable region heavy chain hypermutation indicating a pregerminal center cell origin and a common pathogenesis for these tumors. Furthermore, in 5 of the 16 B-CLLs, ATM mutation preceded the transformation stage of differentiation. At the cellular level, ATM mutant tumors exhibited a deficient ATM-dependent p53 response to gamma irradiation, failure to up-regulate TRAIL-R2, a downstream target that links irradiation- induced p53 response with apoptosis, and an inability to repair induced chromosome breaks. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is also of pregerminal center origin and ATM mutations are frequent in this malignancy. It is concluded that ATM is likely to play an important role at the pregerminal center stage and a model is proposed where loss of ATM function during B-cell ontogeny drives B-CLL tumorigenesis in pregerminal B cells by a dual defect in p53 damage response and repair of chromosome breaks",

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates the prognostic significance of genetic abnormalities (detected at or shortly after presentation), clinical stage, lymphocyte morphology, CD38 expression, and IGVH gene status in 205 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Deletion of chromosome 11q23, absence of a deletion of chromosome 13q14, atypical lymphocyte morphology, and more than 30% CD38 expression are significantly associated with the presence of unmutated IGVH genes. Advanced stage, male sex, atypical morphology, more than 30% CD38 expression, trisomy 12, deletion of chromosome 11q23, loss or mutation of the p53 gene, and unmutated IGVH genes are all poor prognostic factors in a univariate analysis. However, only 98% or more homology of IGVH genes to the germline sequence, loss or mutation of the p53 gene, and clinical stage retain prognostic significance in a multivariate analysis. The median survival of patients with mutated IGVH genes, unmutated IGVH genes, and loss or mutation of the p53 gene regardless of IGVH gene status is 310, 119, and 47 months, respectively. These data should facilitate the design of new trials for the management of patients presenting with advanced disease or poor prognosis early stage disease.",

Moreover, somatic ATM mutations have been identified in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In this study, the entire ATM coding sequence was examined in genomic DNA from 120 lymphoid neoplasms. Novel mutations and mutations implicated in cancer and/or A-T were found in 9 of 45 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), 2 of 24 follicular lymphomas, and 1 of 27 adult acute lymphoblastic leukemias, whereas no such mutations were detected among 24 peripheral T-cell lymphomas. The mutational spectrum consisted of 2 nonsense mutations, 1 mutation affecting RNA splicing, and 10 missense variants. Most of these mutations were associated with loss or mutation of the paired ATM allele, consistent with biallelic inactivation of ATM. Of the 9 DLBCLs with ATM mutations, 7 also carried TP53 mutations and/or deletions of the INK4a/ARF locus (P =.003). The ATM 735C>T substitution previously considered a rare normal variant was found to be 5.6 times more frequent in individuals with DLBCL than in random individuals (P =.026), suggesting that it may predispose to B-cell lymphoma. Our data suggest that ATM mutations contribute to the development of DLBCL, and that ATM and the ARF-p53 tumor suppressor pathway may cooperate in the pathogenesis of this malignancy",

    "Title": "p53 mutation analysis for definite diagnosis of multiple primary lung carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The detection of a second tumor in patients with lung carcinoma raises the question whether this lesion is a metastasis or a second primary lung carcinoma. Patients cannot always be categorized satisfactorily according the criteria of multiple lung carcinoma proposed by Martini and Melamed. This may result in an inadequate treatment schedule in individual patients. Because p53 mutations can be used as clonal marker, the authors investigated whether p53 mutation analysis can differentiate between primary lung carcinomas and metastatic disease. METHODS: Sixty-four tumors in 31 patients with synchronous and metachronous lung tumors were investigated by p53 mutation analysis. RESULTS: In 21 patients, the tumors showed different p53 mutations, and therefore a definite diagnosis of multiple primary lung carcinoma was made. One of these patients did not meet the criteria of Martini and Melamed. In two other patients not matching these criteria, identical mutations were demonstrated in both tumors, indicating the presence of metastatic disease. In eight patients, analysis was not conclusive or possible. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutation analysis can be a useful tool to confirm or rule out multiple primary lung carcinoma, and the results confirm the criteria of Martini and Melamed. However, in patients not meeting these criteria, the diagnosis of multiple lung carcinoma still has to be considered, and metastatic disease has to be ruled out. P53 mutation analysis can be helpful for this purpose",

    "Title": "Prognostic value of p53 mutations, bax, and spontaneous apoptosis in maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many researchers have attempted to correlate p53 mutation and spontaneous apoptosis with the effectiveness of radiochemotherapy and with prognosis in several malignancies. METHODS: The current study group consisted of 70 Japanese patients with maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Fifty seven patients were treated with radiochemotherapy followed by total or partial maxillectomy, and the remaining 13 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Tumor biopsy specimens at pretreatment status were examined for apoptosis- related proteins such as p53 protein, Fas, bax, bcl-x, and apoptosis using immunohistologic methods. The proportion of apoptotic cells labeled by single stranded DNA antibody was expressed as an apoptotic index (AI). p53 mutations at exons 5 through 8 were analyzed by direct sequence on polymerase chain reaction amplified products obtained from laser microdissected tissues. The effectiveness of radiochemotherapy was investigated histologically on surgically dissected specimens. RESULTS: p53 mutations were identified in 20 (29%) of 70 patients. p53 protein was overexpressed in 39 patients (56%), Fas in 20 patients (29%), bax in 40 patients (57%), and bcl-x in 33 patients (47%). Overexpression of bax was associated with negativity of bcl-x (P = 0.015) and with high AI (P = 0.024). Low AI and/or p53 mutation in the pretreatment tissues correlated with low histologic effectiveness of radiochemotherapy (P = 0.048, P = 0.019, respectively). Kaplan-Meier analysis as well as univariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that low histologic effectiveness of radiochemotherapy (P = 0.0281, P = 0.0284, respectively), p53 mutations (P = 0.0095, P = 0.0187, respectively), negativity of bax (P = 0.0069, P = 0.0191, respectively), and low AI (P = 0.0134, P = 0.0407, respectively) were significantly related to worse disease-free survival. Multivariate analysis showed AI as an independent factor predicting for disease-free survival (P = 0.0455). CONCLUSIONS: The p53 mutations, expression of bax, and levels of spontaneous apoptosis have prognostic value in maxillary sinus SCC; AI especially is an independent factor for disease-free survival. A high level of spontaneous apoptosis induced by overexpression of bax may increase sensitivity of radiochemotherapy resulting in good prognosis, while p53 mutation may lead to resistance against radiochemotherapy, resulting in poor prognosis",

    "Title": "Topoisomerase IIalpha gene expression is regulated by the p53 tumor suppressor gene in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma patients",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Topoisomerase IIalpha (Topo IIalpha) is an essential nuclear enzyme for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Previous experimental studies using cell lines reported that Topo IIalpha expression was negatively regulated by wild-type p53 through the gene's promoter region. METHODS: Surgically resected tumor specimens from 98 nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients who were not treated with preoperative chemotherapy were studied. Quantitative reverse- transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis was done to evaluate Topo IIalpha gene expression. Polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism following sequencing was performed to investigate mutations of p53. RESULTS: Topo IIalpha gene expression in squamous cell carcinomas was significantly higher than in adenocarcinomas (P = 0.0007). Topo IIalpha gene expression in moderately differentiated tumors and poorly differentiated tumors was significantly higher than in well differentiated tumors (P = 0.0032 and P = 0.0005, respectively). Thirty nine tumors (40%) had mutations of p53. Topo IIalpha gene expression in tumors with mutant p53 was significantly higher than in those with wild-type p53 (P = 0.0224). CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that Topo IIalpha gene expression is regulated by p53 gene status in NSCLC patients and that the overexpression of Topo IIalpha induced by mutant p53 might cause more aggressive carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Influence of p53 mutations on prognosis of patients with glioblastoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The influence of p53 mutations on the biology of astrocytic tumors is controversial. p53 is thought to be inactivated in the early stage of gliomagenesis; however, what role its inactivation plays in the malignancy of gliomas remains unknown. To understand the significance of p53 inactivation, the authors identified the locus of p53 gene mutation in glioma samples at different stages of progression and studied the correlation between the mutation and clinical behavior. METHODS: Samples from newly diagnosed gliomas, including pure and mixed astrocytomas, were analyzed for p53 mutations using a yeast functional assay. To determine the locus of the gene mutations, DNA sequencing was performed. RESULTS: The incidence of p53 mutations was higher in anaplastic astrocytomas (AA, 48%) than glioblastomas (GBM, 31%). There was no significant difference in the average ages of GBM patients with and without p53 mutations (54.9 years +/- 2.3 and 53.2 years +/- 4.6, respectively). In GBM patients, the mutation did not affect progression free survival or overall survival. Astrocytomas and GBM differed in the distribution of p53 mutation loci. CONCLUSIONS: The p53 gene mutation does not markedly affect the survival of GBM patients. The difference in the location of p53 mutations between AA and GBM suggests that in gliomas, the p53 mutation may contribute not only to tumorigenesis (as an early event) but also to progression to malignancy (as a late event)",

    "Title": "Molecular markers of prognosis in astrocytic tumors",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Astrocytoma is a primary brain tumor that affects 20,000 Americans each year. To date, only age and histologic grade stand out as independent predictors of survival. There is now increased interest in the use of molecular markers as objective standards against which to establish diagnosis and grade. METHODS: The study evaluated human glioma tumor suppressor genes and associated loci in fresh snap-frozen gliomas from 63 males and 37 females, with a median age of 42 years, including 19 low-grade astrocytomas. The tumor samples were selected so that about equal numbers of glioblastomas from younger and older patients were represented in the series. Methods for suppressor gene and genetic loci evaluation included loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, multiplex polymerase chain reaction analysis, and gene sequencing. RESULTS: Low-grade astrocytomas had the least number of molecular abnormalities. LOH on 9p and/or CDKN2A deletion occurred more often in glioblastomas (P < 0.001), LOH on 17p/TP53 mutations occurred more frequently in anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs; P = 0.112), and LOH on 10q/PTEN mutation frequency was similar in glioblastomas and AAs (P < 0.001). Poorer survival was associated significantly with the occurrence of either deletion of p16 (P = 0.031), LOH on 9p (P = 0.016), or LOH on 10q (P = 0.0007). The absence of LOH on 17p and the presence of PTEN mutation were associated marginally with survival. Even though TP53 mutations were more frequent among younger patients with glioblastoma, they had no statistically significant effect on survival after adjustment for age (P = 0.62). In all multivariate models, age and grade were the only significant predictors of survival or were nearly significant predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that LOH on 9p and p16 deletions may prove to be objective standards for the diagnosis of patients with high-grade gliomas, although the absence of these abnormalities is nonprognostic",

    "Title": "Expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1, matrix metalloproteinase 2, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 in carcinoma of the head and neck",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Numerous reports have documented a direct involvement of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) overexpression in the development and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In this study, the authors examined whether the expression of MMPs in HNSCC is correlated with other steps involved in tumor growth and metastasis, like angiogenesis, activation the nitric oxide (NO) pathway, and alteration of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. METHODS: MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression levels were examined immunohistochemically in samples from 43 patients with HNSCC. Microvessel density (MVD) was determined by immunostaining of endothelial cells with anti-CD31 monoclonal antibody. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity and cyclic guanosine monophosphatate (cGMP) levels were assessed in fresh tumor samples, whereas exons 5-9 of the p53 gene were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and were sequenced. RESULTS: MMP-1 overexpression (>10% of tumor cells) was identified in 32 tumors (74.5%), whereas elevated levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were detected in 17 tumors (39.5%) each. Tumors with MMP-9 overexpression were characterized by significantly higher MVD (P = 0.05) and significantly higher iNOS activity and cGMP levels (P = 0.005 and P = 0.02, respectively). Moreover, p53 mutation was associated strongly with MMP-9 overexpression (P = 0.004). Conversely, no correlation was found between MMP-1 and MMP-2 expression, angiogenesis, iNOS activity, cGMP levels, and p53 mutation in this series. CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the existence of a correlation between MMP-9 expression, activity of the iNOS pathway, p53 status, and angiogenesis in patients with HNSCC. This raises the possibility that p53 mutation, which frequently is present in HNSCC, may result in increased angiogenesis and invasiveness related to increased nitric oxide and MMP production by tumor cells, ultimately contributing to tumor progression",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify the prognostic relevance of the G1/S cell cycle regulator genes p16INK4a, p53, MDM2, and Rb in patients with resected ductal pancreatic cancer (PC). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The tumor suppressor genes p16INK4a, p53, and Rb are altered in PC in 27% to 95%, 40% to 70%, and 5%, respectively. The role of MDM2 is not clearly defined in PC. The prognostic value of these cell cycle regulators has not been clarified. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with PC with complete follow-up who underwent potentially curative resections were included in the study. An extreme group analysis was performed including the 20 patients with the shortest survival and the 20 patients with the longest survival. Protein expression of p16, p53, MDM2, and Rb was investigated, and mutation analysis of p16INK4a and p53 was performed. p16INK4a promoter hypermethylation was examined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Significantly more tumors in the shortest-surviving patients had p16INK4a alterations compared with tumors of the longest-surviving patients. In contrast, the frequency of p53 alterations was not significantly higher in the shortest-surviving versus the longest-surviving groups. Stabilization of MDM2 and loss of Rb expression were identified in a minority of tumors, independent of survival length. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of p16INK4a alterations in resected tumors of patients with PC is connected with a worse prognosis, indicating patients that might benefit from adjuvant therapy regimens. p53 alterations, MDM2 overexpression, and loss of Rb expression could not be identified as prognostic markers from this study, but a larger study with greater statistical power might show a different result with regard to p53",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the predictive power of p53 gene analysis versus p53 immunohistochemical staining in terms of response to preoperative short-term radiotherapy using 25 Gy in operable rectal cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Recent studies show that p53 may be a determinant of radiosensitivity being required for induction of apoptosis in case of radiation-induced DNA damage. METHODS: Preirradiation biopsy samples of 64 patients with rectal carcinoma were analyzed. Genetic alterations of the p53 gene were detected by complete direct sequencing of exons 2 to 10. Expression of the nuclear phosphoprotein p53 was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. Results were correlated with histopathology of resected specimens and follow-up data, respectively. RESULTS: Mutations of the p53 gene were present in 45% of tumors. Patients with a normal p53 gene had a significant survival advantage. Comparing pre- and postradiotherapy T category, a reduction was seen in patients with normal p53 genotype only. A mutant p53 genotype was highly specific in indicating stable disease concerning T category after irradiation. Protein overexpression was detected in 61%. Overexpression of the p53 protein was not related to survival or response. The concordance between immunohistochemistry and sequencing was only 0.51. CONCLUSIONS: The authors show that downstaging after short-term radiation may occur but is seen in tumors with normal p53 gene only. Moreover, p53 genotype but not p53 immunohistochemistry is predictive for response to preoperative short- term radiotherapy and patient survival",

    "Title": "Genetic and epigenetic alterations of the INK4a-ARF pathway in cholangiocarcinoma",
    "Abstract": "The INK4a-ARF locus, located on chromosome 9p21, encodes two cell-cycle regulatory proteins, p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), acting through the Rb-CDK4 and p53 pathways. To study the contribution of each pathway in the tumourigenesis of cholangiocarcinoma, the alterations of p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), p53, and pRb were analysed. After microdissection, DNAs from 51 cholangiocarcinomas were analysed by methylation-specific PCR (MSP), restriction-enzyme related polymerase chain reaction (RE-PCR), microsatellite analysis, mRNA expression, and DNA sequencing. Immunohistochemistry of p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), p53, and pRb was also performed. Promoter methylation of p14(ARF) was found in 13/51 cases (25%) and p16(INK4a) showed aberrant promoter methylation in 39/51 cases (76%) which correlated with loss of mRNA transcription. Two tumours (4%) had homozygous deletion of the INK4a-ARF locus. Specific mutations of both exons were not detected. p14(ARF) inactivation appeared in the context of an unmethylated p16(INK4a) promoter in eight of 13 cases (61%) of the carcinomas methylated at p14(ARF). Mutations of p53 were found in 19 of 51 tumours (37%), and four of them (21%) harboured p14(ARF) inactivation. The pRb protein was detected in 30/51 (59%) tumours examined. The absence of pRB protein did not correlate with any of the examined parameters. Alterations of the INK4a-ARF locus, pRB or p53 status could not be established as independent prognostic factors in these tumours. These findings indicate that the INK4a-ARF locus is frequently inactivated in cholangiocarcinoma of the liver and occurs independently of the status of p53 or pRb",

    "Title": "Mutated p53 as a molecular marker for the diagnosis of head and neck cancer",
    "Abstract": "In total, 10-30% of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) develop local recurrences despite seemingly adequate tumour resection. This may result from minimal residual cancer (MRC): small numbers of tumour cells left behind in the surgical margins, undetectable by routine histopathology. In recent studies, p53 mutations have been considered as selective and sensitive DNA markers of cancer cells. There are two potential problems in using mutated-p53 DNA as a marker. Firstly, p53 mutations occur early in progression and might therefore detect unresected precursor lesions besides tumour cells. Secondly, DNA is a very stable biomolecule that might lead to false-positive results. These two potential problems have been evaluated in this study. Fifty patients with a radical tumour resection were included, of whom 30 showed a p53 mutation in the primary tumour. Histopathologically tumour-free surgical margins were quantitatively analysed for mutated p53 by molecular diagnosis (plaque assay) and subsequent (immuno)histopathology. p53 mutated DNA was detected in the surgical margins of 19/30 patients. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of small tumour foci in 2/19 mutated p53-positive cases. In 7/19 cases, the tumour-specific p53 mutation was found in unresected dysplastic mucosal precursor lesions. Moreover, in a number of cases small p53-immunostained patches were detected, but the mutations found were never tumour-related. By screening contralateral exfoliated cells and plaque assays on RNA it was shown that detection of mutated-p53 DNA is prone to false-positive results. In conclusion, using p53 mutations as a marker, both MRC and unresected mutated p53-positive mucosal precursor lesions are detected within surgical margins. Molecular assessment of surgical margins using p53 mutations enables the selection of HNSCC patients at high risk for tumour recurrence, but tumour RNA seems at present to be a more specific biomolecule for analysis than tumour DNA",

    "Abstract": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a distinct type of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma characterized by cyclin D1 overexpression and the cytogenetic abnormality, the t(11;14)(q13;q32). MCL cell lines have been difficult to establish and in vitro studies of these neoplasms are scarce. We describe the establishment and characteristics of a new MCL cell line, Mino. The cells are large, growing singly and in small clumps in vitro. By flow cytometry, the immunophenotype was compatible with MCL (i.e. CD5+CD20+CD23-FMC7+). Conventional cytogenetics showed hyperdiploidy with multiple complex karyotypic abnormalities, but no evidence of the t(11;14), proven to be present only by fluorescence in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Western blots showed expression of cyclin D1 but no detectable cyclin D2 and cyclin D3; the retinoblastoma protein was predominantly phosphorylated. There was expression of tumor suppressor gene products including p53, p16(INK4a), and p21(WAF1). Sequencing of the TP53 gene revealed a mutation (codon 147(valine-->glycine)) in exon 5. Epstein Barr virus was absent. In summary, Mino is a new MCL cell line that may be useful to study the pathogenesis of MCL",

    "Title": "Concomitant inactivation of p53 and Chk2 in breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "The structure and expression of the human Rad53 homologue Chk2 was analysed in breast cancer. The previously described silent polymorphism at nucleotide 252 in codon 84 (GAA>GAG) was observed in 5/141 cases. Somatic Chk2 coding mutations were detected in 7/141 cases, these occurring in 4/18 BRCA1-associated breast cancers, 1/78 sporadic breast cancers and 2/25 typical medullary carcinomas. Each of the BRCA1- associated cancers with Chk2 mutations also contained mutations in p53, whereas the single sporadic cancer with Chk2 mutation was wild-type for p53. Expression of Chk2 was ubiquitously detected in normal ductal epithelium of the breast, but there was loss of expression in a significant proportion of breast carcinomas, and this occurred in cancers both with and without p53 mutation. A CpG island was identified 5' of the Chk2 transcriptional start site, but there was no evidence of cytosine methylation in any of the cancers with down-regulated Chk2 expression. Analysis of the germ-line of 45 individuals with hereditary or early onset breast cancer revealed wild-type Chk2 sequence in all cases. Thus, despite the rarity of somatic mutations in Chk2 in sporadic breast carcinomas, our results nevertheless reveal that concomitant loss of function in Chk2 (via down-regulation of expression) and p53 (via mutation) occurs in a proportion of sporadic cases. However, consistent with other studies, we show that germ-line mutations in Chk2 are unlikely to account for a significant proportion of non BRCA1-, non BRCA2-associated hereditary breast cancers",

    "Title": "High incidence of protein-truncating mutations of the p53 gene in liver metastases of colorectal carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "To clarify the significance of p53 mutations in liver metastasis of colorectal carcinogenesis, the characteristics of p53 mutations from 51 liver metastases and 76 primary invasive carcinomas without liver metastasis (Dukes' A, B and C) were compared. The frequency of tumors with p53 mutations was 61% (31 out of 51) in the liver metastases, and 51% (39 out of 76) in the primary carcinomas without liver metastasis. Approximately 90% of the informative cases having p53 mutation showed 17pLOH. Mutations detected within exons 4-10 of the p53 gene included missense, nonsense, frameshift, inframe deletion, and inframe insertion mutations. Out of the tumors with p53 mutations, we found that the percentage of tumors with protein-truncating mutations (nonsense and frameshift mutations) was extremely higher in liver metastases (16 out of 31, 52%) than in primary carcinomas without liver metastasis (5 out of 39, 13%) (P=0.0005). The present results suggest that protein-truncating mutations of the p53 gene are more relevant than missense mutations as one of the prognostic factors in liver metastasis of colorectal carcinomas",

    "Title": "Novel colon cancer cell lines leading to better understanding of the diversity of respective primary cancers",
    "Abstract": "A major obstacle to obtaining more detailed insights into the diversity of phenotypic and molecular changes occurring in colon cancer cells is the lack of low-passage colon cancer cell lines, which would still closely reflect the phenotype of the colon cancer cells in vivo. Here, we characterize eight novel, low passage number human colon carcinoma cell lines, originating from colorectal cancers extensively characterized in the clinics. All cell lines closely resemble the original tumors with respect to phenotype, markers and detectable genetic changes. Cell morphology and marker expression is highly variable, ranging from fully polarized cells correctly expressing all basolateral epithelial markers, to cells with mesenchymal characteristics and a complete loss of polarity due to delocalization or loss of junction complex proteins. The alterations in phenotype and epithelial marker expression correspond to changes already detectable in the primary tumor in vivo. Seven of the cell lines show chromosomal instability, while one cell line is characterized by microsatellite instability. p53 associated with K-ras mutations were detected in three cell lines. Hitherto non-described E-cadherin mutations were found at both alleles in one cell line whereas in another cell line the E-cadherin protein was down-regulated. A stabilizing beta-catenin mutation (S45F) appears in the same cell line that carried the mutated E-cadherin gene. Six cell lines carried APC mutations, which in five of the lines led to an activated beta-catenin/Tcf/LEF signaling pathway. In accordance with beta-catenin/Tcf/LEF activation, the cell lines show increased migration and invasiveness. Our results show that the characterized, low-passage cell lines mirror the diversity of the individual tumors from which they were derived. Through molecular analyses of these cell lines we demonstrate that tumorgenicity events are much more diverse in human colon cancer than expected, despite the common origin of the tumors from a small patient group with similar tumor grading and clinical prognosis",

    "Title": "Postatrophic hyperplasia of the prostate in Japan: histologic and immunohistochemical features and p53 gene mutation analysis",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postatrophic hyperplasia (PAH) is one of the patterns of prostatic atrophy but has been regarded as a precursor of prostatic cancer (PCA) because of its possible increase in proliferative activity compared with simple atrophy and morphologic mimicry of PCA. METHODS: Radical prostatectomy specimens obtained from 28 patients with PCA were analyzed by histologic and immunohistochemical methods by using 34 beta E12 and Ki-67 as primary antibodies. Tissue from PAH, PCA, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), a possible precursor of PCA, and benign hyperplasia were microdissected and p53 gene mutations were examined by the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism method followed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Histologically, PAH consists of compactly arranged small acini with irregular atrophic-appearing contours, mimicking PCA. PAH lesions were detected in 7 (25%) of 28 cases with PCA: multifocal in 6 of 7 (85.7%) cases, maximum size of lesions ranged from 0.3 to 2.3 mm. Mild nuclear enlargement and small nucleoli were observed in all cases. Capsular or perineural invasion, crystalloids, and mitotic figures were not found in any case. Inflammatory changes and fibrosis near PAH were found in 100% and 71% of cases, respectively. PAH involved non-transition zone in all cases and occasionally involved transition zone. Forty-three percent of PAH lesions were in proximity (<2 mm) to PCA. None of the clinical and pathologic factors examined were correlated with the presence of PAH. Immunohistochemical analysis by using 34 beta E12 revealed intact basal cells. Proliferative activity defined by positive rate for labeling with MIB-1 antibody was intermediate between benign prostatic hyperplasia and HGPIN. The frequency of p53 mutations in PAH lesions was 5.3%, which was similar to that in HGPIN lesions (4.2%). Benign glands never showed mutations. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that PAH might be a precursor for PCA",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations are associated with poor survival in low and low- intermediate risk diffuse large B-cell lymphomas",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: p53 alterations have been associated with a poor prognosis in aggressive B-cell lymphoma. We investigated the clinical relevance of p53 status in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), focusing on patients who belong to lower risk groups of the international prognostic index and were uniformly treated. We aimed to determine whether this biological marker could identify among such patients those with a pejorative outcome who could benefit from a distinct therapeutic approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 69 patients presenting with no, one (low-risk, n = 40) or two (low-intermediate risk, n = 29) risk factors treated with an anthracyclin-containing induction regimen. p53 exons 5-8 mutations were screened for using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and confirmed by direct sequencing. Immunohistochemical detection of p53 protein and of its downstream target p21 were also evaluated in 60 of 69 cases. RESULTS: p53 mutations were detected in 16 of 69 (23%) lymphoma samples. The presence of a p53 gene mutation affected survival (P = 0.01), with a 6-year survival rate estimated to be 44% in mutated patients, compared with 79% in non-mutated ones. Using a stepwise Cox model, p53 mutation constituted the only parameter affecting survival (relative risk = 2.7, P = 0.03). A p53(+)/p21(-) immunohistochemical pattern (n = 15), suggestive of a disrupted p53 function, strongly correlated with p53 gene status and was associated with a lower 6-year survival rate when compared with a p53(-) or p53(+)/p21(+) phenotype (47% versus 74%, P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: p53 alterations constitute a pejorative biological indicator able to discriminate among clinically defined lower risk patients with DLBCL",

    "Title": "Human papillomavirus and p53 mutational status as prognostic factors in head and neck carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mutations of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene are common in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and may portend a worse prognosis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) represents another potential prognostic factor for SCCHN. The oncogenic potential of HPV may be due to the ability of its E6 oncoprotein to promote degradation of wild-type p53 protein. We wish to determine whether there is a lower incidence of p53 mutations in HPV-positive versus HPV-negative tumors, and if HPV and/or p53 status has an impact on survival. METHODS: Thirty-two SCCHN specimens were analyzed for mutations of the p53 gene using single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis followed by DNA sequencing. The HPV status of all specimens was evaluated by use of polymerase chain reaction with HPV consensus primers and Southern blot hybridization. Pertinent clinical information was obtained from chart review. RESULTS: Nonsilent p53 mutations were present in 2 of 15 (13%) of HPV-positive tumors compared with 6 of 17 (35%) of HPV-negative tumors (p =.229; Fisher's exact test, odds ratio.28). A survival advantage was found between HPV-positive compared with HPV-negative specimens (p =.0264) and between p53 wild type compared with p53 mutant specimens (p =.01) by univariate log rank analysis. When stratified according to both HPV and p53 status, a statistically significant survival difference was observed largely because of a 100% survival for the HPV-positive/p53 wild-type group (p =.003). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study supports the notion that the presence of HPV confers a survival advantage among HNSCC patients, particularly when p53 is wild type",

    "Abstract": "Alterations in the p53 gene are among the most common molecular changes in breast cancer although its potential role as a prognostic and predictive factor of tumor response is controversial. All abnormalities of this tumor marker need to be detected with efficacy and practical technologies. In the present study, our aim was to compare four different analyses of p53 in order to determine how many and which techniques were necessary and sufficient to reflect the p53 status in breast cancer. We analyzed p53 at the molecular level with sequencing of total cDNA and allelic loss. Furthermore, we detected p53 protein accumulation by immunohistochemistry and presence of p53 antibodies by serological analysis. Nine patients (17%) had p53 gene alterations, 33% had allelic loss, 19% had positive p53 nuclear staining and p53 antibodies were detected in 12% of patients. We found p53 gene alterations associated with p53 nuclear protein expression (p=0.001). The single significant statistical correlation in this study suggested the need to define p53 status with more than one abnormality. The general view of a simultaneous multilevel analysis would make it possible to encompass the consequences of p53 abnormalities in breast cancer",

    "Title": "p53 mutations as tumor markers in fine needle aspirates of palpable breast masses",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mutations in p53 exons 5-8 are found in 40-50% of breast carcinomas. We performed a retrospective analysis of p53 mutations in fluid-based, archival fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses to determine their potential diagnostic utility as breast tumor cell markers. STUDY DESIGN: Residual, fluid-based, archival FNAs of 27 breast masses were retrospectively evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP) and sequencing for p53 exons 5-8. Results were compared with the morphologic diagnoses and genotyping of available excisional biopsy tissue. RESULTS: Six of the twenty-seven cases were found to have a clonal mutation in p53; all six mutated cases showed carcinoma on subsequent excisional biopsy. Definitive cytologic diagnosis of cancer had been possible in only four of the six cases. Identical mutations were found in the excised carcinomas in the five cases with available tissue. None of the 14 aspirates with benign cytology had detectable mutations in p53. CONCLUSION: p53 Mutational analysis by PCR/SSCP/sequencing deserves to be critically studied as a diagnostic criterion in patients with indeterminate or suspicious cytology. Validation studies should be performed to test p53 mutations as molecular diagnostic markers in breast cytology specimens",

    "Title": "Gliomatosis cerebri: molecular pathology and clinical course",
    "Abstract": "Gliomatosis cerebri is a rare, diffusely growing neuroepithelial tumor characterized by extensive brain infiltration involving more than two cerebral lobes. Among 13 patients with gliomatosis cerebri (median age, 46 years), biopsies showed features of diffuse astrocytoma (n = 4), oligoastrocytoma (n = 1), anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 5), anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (n = 1), or glioblastoma (n = 2). Molecular genetic investigation showed TP53 mutations in three of seven tumors and both PTEN mutation and epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression in one tumor. Amplification of CDK4 or MDM2 or homozygous deletion of CDKN2A was not detected. Three of 10 patients receiving radiotherapy showed a partial response (one patient) or had stable disease (two patients) lasting for more than 1 year. Four of six patients treated with procarbazine, carmustine, vincristine chemotherapy demonstrated partial remission (one patient), minor response (two patients), or stable disease (one patient). Median survival time from diagnosis was 14 months (range, 4-91+ months). Infratentorial involvement was associated with shorter survival. We conclude that (1) the molecular genetic alterations in gliomatosis cerebri resemble those in diffuse astrocytomas; (2) the prognosis of gliomatosis cerebri is variable but for at least 50% of patients as poor as for glioblastoma; and (3) some patients respond to radiotherapy and/or procarbazine, carmustine, vincristine chemotherapy",

    "Title": "Occurrence of chromosome 9 and p53 alterations in multifocal dysplasia and carcinoma in situ of human urinary bladder",
    "Abstract": "To define the genetic changes of flat urothelial lesions, carcinoma in situ (CIS) and moderate dysplasias (DII) were investigated for alterations in the two chromosomal regions most frequently involved in bladder cancer. Overall, 33 CIS and 16 DII from 21 patients were used to microdissect urothelium. Dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using gene locus probes of 9q22 (FACC), 9p21 (CDK), 17p13 (p53), and related centromeric probes was applied on interphase nuclei. In parallel, preamplified DNA of these samples was used for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses with eight microsatellite markers on chromosomes 9p, 9q and 17p, and for sequencing of exons 5-9 of p53. Data indicated nearly identical deletion frequencies for chromosomes 9 and 17 for CIS (chromosome 9, 86%; p53, 84%). DII showed a lower deletion rate in comparison with CIS (chromosome 9, 75%; p53, 53%). A very high correlation between the results of FISH and LOH analyses was found. p53 mutations were detected in 12 of 15 patients (CIS, 72%; DII, 67%). In three of 16 patients with multifocal tumors, oligoclonal lesions were identified by LOH analyses, a finding further supported by sequencing of p53, by which two different p53 deletions were detected in two cases. In conclusion, data from microdissected flat urothelial lesions indicate that chromosome 9 deletions cannot be regarded as indicators of papillary growth, because they are found frequently in both types of flat lesions of the urothelium: those associated with papillary tumors and those that are not. The similar distribution and lower amount of genetic changes in DII render DII a possible precursor lesion of CIS",

    "Title": "Prevalence and spectrum of p53 mutations associated with smoking in breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "To explore the role of smoking in breast cancer, we undertook a population-based study to evaluate the prevalence and spectrum of p53 mutations in the breast tumors of smokers and nonsmokers. We evaluated 456 archival invasive breast tumors for mutations in exons 4-8 of the p53 gene, using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and manual sequencing. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the association of p53 mutations with clinical and smoking characteristics. Of 108 mutations identified, 77 (71%) were point mutations and 31 (29%) were deletions or insertions. A higher prevalence of p53 mutations was found in the breast tumors of current smokers (36.5%; P = 0.02) compared with never smokers (23.6%), whereas fewer mutations were found in former smokers (16.2%; P = 0.09). After adjustment for age, race, menopausal status, clinical stage, tumor size, and family history of breast cancer, current smokers were significantly more likely to harbor any p53 mutation [odds ratio (OR), 2.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-3.78], p53 transversions (OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.03-11.06), and G:C--&gt;T:A transversions (OR, 10.53; 95% CI, 1.77-62.55) compared with never smokers. Stage at diagnosis did not account for the increase in p53 mutation-positive breast cancer among current smokers. Former smokers were also more likely than never smokers to harbor G:C--&gt;T:A transversions (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 0.37-15.73), although this association was not statistically significant. Among former smokers, the prevalence of p53 mutations varied with time since quitting: former smokers who quit smoking for longer than 1 year had a lower prevalence of p53 mutations (10.5% for 1-5 years and 12.9% for &gt;5 years) than those who had stopped smoking within the year of their cancer diagnosis (26.3%). Our results indicate that cigarette smoking appears to modify the prevalence and spectrum of p53 mutations in breast tumors. Moreover, the difference in mutational spectra observed between smokers and nonsmokers is suggestive of the genotoxic effects of smoking in breast tissue",

    "Title": "Oncolytic activity of the E1B-55 kDa-deleted adenovirus ONYX-015 is independent of cellular p53 status in human malignant glioma xenografts",
    "Abstract": "Treatment of malignant gliomas remains a major challenge in adults and children because of high treatment failure. The E1B 55 kDa-gene deleted adenovirus, ONYX-015 (ONYX Pharmaceuticals), was demonstrated to replicate selectively in and lyse tumor cells. Currently ongoing clinical trials of ONYX-015 in head and neck tumors are promising. Here, we demonstrate ONYX-015-mediated cell lysis and antitumor activity in three of four s.c. human malignant glioma xenografts deriving from primary tumors. Intratumoral injections of ONYX-015, 1 x 10(8) plaque-forming units daily for 5 consecutive days, yielded significant tumor growth delay in the p53 mutant xenografts IGRG88 and the p53 wild-type IGRG93 and IGRG121 treated at an advanced tumor stage. The p53 wild-type tumors IGRG93 and IGRG121 experienced 45% and 82% complete tumor regressions. Four and 8 of 11 animals, respectively, survived tumor free 4 months after treatment. Widespread intratumoral adenoviral replication was observed in tumor cells of these two xenografts compared with only scattered replication in the p53-mutant tumors. In addition to a fast tumor growth rate, wild-type p53 status was associated with increased antitumor activity of the E1B-attenuated virus, and induction of functional p53 may therefore determine adenoviral cytolysis in tumor cells. In conclusion, ONYX-015 displayed a major antitumor activity in human xenografts derived from primary malignant glioma supporting its development in the treatment of these highly malignant tumors",

    "Abstract": "Oligoastrocytomas (OA) are mixed glial tumors that show morphologic features of both oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. The histogenesis of these tumors remains undefined. The aim of this study was to investigate the clonality of OA on the basis of tumor-dependent genetic alterations and tumor-independent X-chromosome inactivation. We microdissected 11 biphasic OA and subjected the oligodendroglial and astrocytic components to allelic loss analysis of chromosomes 1p, 9p21, 10q, 13q, 17p, and 19q; TP53 immunohistochemical and mutation analyses; and X-linked HUMARA gene methylation study. On the basis of the genetic findings, we categorized these tumors into 3 groups. Group 1 consisted of 4 tumors that showed identical genetic aberrations in the 2 histologic elements, characterized by allelic loss on 1p and 19q. These results suggest that group 1 tumors are of monoclonal origin and share a precursor cell with oligodendrogliomas. Group 2 consisted of 5 tumors characterized by losses on 1p and 19q, with additional allelic losses on chromosomes 9p, 10q, 13q and/or 17p. Four of these tumors were of the anaplastic type. Thus, group 2 tumors may be regarded as advanced variants of group 1 OA with heterogeneous genetic changes during clonal expansion. The X-chromosome inactivation analysis confirmed the monoclonality of groups 1 and 2 OA. Group 3 consisted of two tumors that showed divergent allelic loss patterns in the 2 histologic components. Mutation and overexpression of TP53 were detectable in the astrocytic components only. These findings raise the possibility that group 3 tumors have a biclonal origin. In conclusion, our results suggest that OA are predominantly of monoclonal origin but that a small subset of tumors may be derived from different precursors",

    "Abstract": "In our previous study, we found no genetic alteration in exons 1 and 2 of Ha- and Ki-ras oncogenes nor in exons 5 to 9 of the p53 suppressor gene in seven Japanese malignant mesothelioma patients exposed to asbestos. To examine further whether malignant mesothelioma due to asbestos has genetic alterations in the p53 suppressor gene and in Ha- and Ki-ras oncogenes, we analyzed point mutations of these genes in paraffin embedded operative open biopsied samples of the primary tumor of malignant mesothelioma in twelve American patients. The genetic analysis was conducted by the PCR-SSCP (polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism) method in all patients and by sequencing analysis of DNA bases in the two patients with suspected gene mutation. The analysis of the p53 suppressor gene showed an amino acid converting mutation of exon 7 in one patient and a polymorphism of exon 6 in another patient; the former patient was a heavy smoker with a biphasic cell type. No genetic alteration was found in exons 1 and 2 of Ha- and Ki-ras oncogenes in any of the patients. The results suggest that the effects of asbestos on the p53 suppressor gene and Ha- and Ki- ras oncogenes in malignant mesothelioma are negligible. Further studies are needed to examine whether the observed mutation of the p53 suppressor gene is due to the combined effects of asbestos and smoking or to other unknown factors",

    "Abstract": "To assess whether a satellite lesion in the primary-tumor lobe is intrapulmonary metastasis from primary cancer (pm 1) or they are double primary lung cancers, we examined the postoperative prognosis of patients with pm 1 and the p 53 genetic differentiation between a satellite lesion and a primary lesion. Of 772 consecutive patients with N0-2M0 non-small cell lung cancer who underwent surgical resections between 1979 and 2000, 31 patients had a satellite lesion in the primary-tumor lobe. The 5-year survival rate was 26.3% in the pm 1 (+) T 4 group (n = 37), 14.7% in the pm 1 (-) T 4 group (n = 43), and 32.5% in the T 3 group (n = 132), suggesting that pm 1 cases should be classified as T 3. We examined 16 of 37 patients with pm 1 for mutations of the p 53 gene occurring exons 5 through 8 by the fluorescence-based polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism. Seven of the 16 patients analyzed had at least one p 53 mutations in their tumors. The mutational status of the p 53 gene was discordant in 5 patients, suggesting they were double primary lung cancers. The mutational status including DNA sequencing of the p 53 gene was concordant in 2 patients, suggesting they were intrapulmonary metastases. It remains arguable in the TNM staging system whether a satellite lesion in the primary-tumor lobe is intrapulmonary metastasis from primary cancer or they are double primary lung cancers",

    "Title": "Gene mutations in lymphoproliferative disorders of T and NK/T cell phenotypes developing in renal transplant patients",
    "Abstract": "Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PT-LPD) is characterized by lymphoid proliferation after organ or bone marrow transplantation. In Western countries, most cases of PT-LPD are B-cell- derived and Epstein-Barr virus-associated, in which alterations of c- myc, p53, and N-ras genes might play a role in disease progression. In Japan, PT-LPD of T- and NK/T-cell types are not uncommon in renal transplant patients. Mutations of p53 (exons 4 through 8), K-ras (exons 1 and 2), c-kit (exons 11 and 17), and beta-catenin genes (exon 3) in 12 cases of these diseases were analyzed by PCR single strand conformation polymorphism and then by direct sequencing. p53 gene mutations were detected in 5 of 5 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, 3 (60%) of 5 cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, and 1 of 2 cases of NK/T cell lymphoma. Twenty-five percent of T and NK/T cell lymphomas showed K-ras mutations. Mutations of c-kit and beta-catenin genes were found in 33% of cases. Among a total of 42 substitution mutations, 40 were transitions with involvement of CpG sites in 20 to 30% of cases. Most cases had at least one mutation that changed an amino acid, which might have provided the selection pressure for expansion. These findings suggested that p53 gene mutations might play a central role in development of peripheral T-cell lymphoma including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma in renal transplant patients",

    "Title": "Histologic-genetic mapping by allele-specific PCR reveals intraurothelial spread of p53 mutant tumor clones",
    "Abstract": "Common and clinically important features of urothelial carcinomas are multifocality and a high rate of recurrence. Molecular studies demonstrated that multifocal tumors are frequently composed of one tumor clone spreading throughout the urothelial tract. A combination of histologic and genetic mapping of cystectomy specimens from bladder cancer patients is a valuable tool to study bladder carcinogenesis and tumor cell spread by correlating urothelial morphologic features and defined genetic alterations. In the present study, the primary tumors of 14 cystectomy specimens were investigated for p53 protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry and p53 gene mutation by genomic sequencing. Seven tumors showed a strong nuclear staining for the p53 protein. In six of seven tumors, a p53 gene mutation was detected. Allele-specific PCR of defined p53 mutations was established in five of six cases with a p53 mutation. Subsequent screening of the entire urothelial lining of each cystectomy specimen by allele-specific PCR revealed p53-mutant cell clones in urothelial patches with carcinoma in situ and dysplasia, but also frequently in histomorphologically normal urothelium adjacent to the tumor. The pattern of tumor cell spread indicated a continuous intraurothelial growth of the p53-mutant clone. P53 immunohistochemistry visually confirmed the presence of mutant cells in most of these samples. We conclude that allele-specific PCR is a highly sensitive and reliable method for tracking specific p53 mutant clones in the urothelium. Moreover, the detection of p53-mutant cells in histologically normal or preneoplastic urothelial areas in four patients with invasive bladder cancer indicates an extensive intraurothelial tumor cell spread. The excellent correlation of immunohistochemically positive urothelial patches with the presence of a specific mutation highlights the biologic significance of p53-positive cells in the urothelium of tumor patients",

    "Title": "Infrequent p53 Gene Mutations and Lack of p53 Protein Expression in Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney: Immunohistochemical Study and Mutation Analysis of p53 in Renal Tumors of Unfavorable Prognosis",
    "Abstract": "A high prevalence of p53 gene mutation and protein expression has been found in the anaplastic variant of Wilms' tumor (WT), known to be associated with poor outcome. However, there are very few studies of p53 alterations in the other two rare and highly malignant renal tumors in childhood, in other words, clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) and malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (MRTK). Overexpression of p53 protein has been detected in eight CCSKs in one study, and in two in another, yet no molecular correlation with p53 gene mutations has been carried out. Our study is the first molecular analysis concerning p53 in CCSK. We investigated eight cases of CCSK and one case of MRTK for p53 protein expression by immunohistochemical staining. All were analyzed for p53 mutations in the region of exons 4 to 8 by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method and DNA sequencing analysis. By histological study, no CCSK showed anaplastic features. None expressed p53 protein, but two harbored p53 mutations. One was in exon 5, with a base pair insertion between codons 162 to 163 causing frameshift alteration in amino acid. Another was a silent CTC-->CTT transversion in codon 289 of exon 8. The case of MRTK did not show any alterations of p53 protein or gene. Our result indicates that p53 alterations are infrequent in CCSK and do not seem to be primary genetic events in the pathogenesis of CCSK",

    "Title": "Molecular Analysis of p53, MDM2, and H-ras Genes in Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone in Patients Older than 40 Years",
    "Abstract": "Some investigators have reported that the histological features of osteosarcoma (OS) arising in elderly patients are different from those in younger patients; however, a molecular biologic study of OS in elderly patients has not been documented. In this study, 23 cases of OS (15 osteoblastic and 8 MFH-like types) and 18 cases of MFH of bone in patients 40 years of age or older were analyzed for mutation of the p53 gene, amplification of the MDM2 gene, and mutation of the H-ras gene, using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded materials. We also examined the expression of p53, MDM2, and p21WAF1 protein immunohistochemically and assessed the proliferative activities using the monoclonal antibody MIB-1. p53 immunoreactivity was recognized in 5 of 23 OS cases (22%), whereas p53 gene mutations were also detected in 5 of 23 OS cases (22%; osteoblastic [4/15; 27%] and MFH-like [1/8; 18%] types) and in 4 of 18 cases of MFH of bone (22%). There was a statistically significant correlation between p53 immunoreactivity and p53 mutation status in OS (P =.0482). All those cases of osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone that had p53 mutations, with the exception of one case of MFH of bone that had a silent mutation, showed aggressive biologic behavior (dead of disease within 12 mo), in contrast to the MFH-like OS cases (alive without disease at 22 mo). Three cases of OS (13%) and three cases of MFH of bone (17%) showed immunoreactivity for MDM2. As for gene alteration, three cases of OS (13%) and 3 cases of MFH of bone (17%) demonstrated MDM2 amplification. MDM2 amplification showed a significant correlation with the expression of MDM2 protein in OS (P =.0344). p21WAF1 expression was detected in three cases of OS (13%) and in six cases of MFH of bone (33%). MDM2 alteration and p21WAF1 expression were not observed in any of the cases of MFH-like OS. MIB-1-LI showed a statistically significant correlation with p53 immunoreactivity and MDM2 immunoreactivity in OS (P =.0307 and P =.0358, respectively). H-ras mutation at Codons 12 and 13 was not recognized in any of the cases of OS or MFH of bone. In conclusion, although treatment differences during the time of study make it difficult to compare survival analysis, in the current study, p53 mutation in osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone in elderly patients seemed to be closely associated with the progression of the tumor, which was not the case in MFH-like OS. Furthermore, MDM2 alteration and p21WAF1 expression were demonstrated only in osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone, whereas they were not recognized in MFH-like OS. Although the number of patients in this analysis was small, it would appear that MFH-like OS may have some characteristic biologic aspects when compared with osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone in elderly patients",

    "Title": "Limitations of the use of single base changes in the p53 gene to detect minimal residual disease of breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation is frequently used in the treatment of malignant diseases, but contamination of the graft by tumour cells is a real concern and may lead to disease relapse. The feasibility of applying heterogeneous single base genetic changes as tumour specific markers to detect minimal residual disease in PBPC harvests was studied, using the p53 gene and breast cancer as models. METHODS: Tumour tissues from 51 patients with cellular aliquots from PBPC harvests available were studied. Thirty eight patients had metastatic disease or were at high risk of metastasis, and 13 had high risk stage II/III disease with four or more involved axillary lymph nodes. Tumour DNA was screened for p53 mutations in exons 5 to 9, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, followed by sequencing. Based on sequence information, allele specific primers were designed for each mutation and the non- radioisotopic, amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) was used to screen DNA from PBPC harvests for minimal residual disease. Attempts were made to optimise each system, based on parameters determined using the T47D breast cancer cell line with a confirmed point mutation in codon 194. RESULTS: Twelve different somatic mutations were found, two of which could not be sequenced. The remainder were point mutations. Only five of the 10 ARMS systems were successfully optimised, and minimal residual disease detection sensitivities ranged from one copy of tumour DNA in 10(2) to 10(3) copies of wild-type DNA. Using ARMS, three of five patients and eight of 12 of their PBPC harvests showed minimal residual disease. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of single base genetic changes in minimal residual disease detection is relatively insensitive and is limited to a small number of patients and to certain mutations. In addition, it is labourious and therefore unlikely to play an important role in clinical practice",

    "Title": "P53 tumor suppressor gene mutations in laryngeal cancer and in recurrent disease following radiation therapy",
    "Abstract": "In this study we performed p53 sequencing based mutation analysis in laryngeal cancers and matched recurrent disease following irradiation. The question is if irradiation affects the DNA and introduces or deletes mutations so that p53 cannot be used as a clonal marker anymore. P53 mutations were identified in fresh-frozen laryngectomy specimens with either primary laryngeal cancers, treated by surgery and irradiation post-operative with local failure during follow-up, or with recurrent laryngeal cancers following primary irradiation. In 21 tumors the p53 status was analyzed by direct sequencing full-length mRNA through RT-PCR. DNA sequencing analysis of exons 2 through 11 was performed when RNA isolation could not be performed. The marker mutation identified in this way was detected by DNA sequencing of the corresponding exon in formalin-fixed deparaffinized tumor biopsy samples in respectively matched recurrent disease following surgery and irradiation or primary tumor before irradiation. DNA sequencing analysis of the corresponding exon of peripheral blood leukocytes excluded the presence of germline mutations or polymorphisms. In 16 out of 21 tumors (71%), a mutation was identified. Fifteen of these marker mutations were detected in the matched tumor biopsy sample (94%). The only case lacking the marker mutation probably was a second primary tumor. We conclude that we find no direct evidence for induction or loss of p53 mutations following irradiation. Consequently, p53 may be used as a diagnostic tool when histological examination fails, for example in discriminating between the presence of a second primary tumor in the same area versus recurrent disease",

    "Title": "Molecular characterization of angiogenic properties of human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells",
    "Abstract": "Little is known about the specificity of angiogenic properties of oral cancer cells and the possible mechanisms. Stimulatory effects on proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) characterized the angiogenic properties of oral cancer cells but not normal oral keratinocytes (NOK). ELISA found the presence of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) both in the tested oral cancer cells and NOK. Attenuation of the proangiogenic effects by neutralizing VEGF antibodies suggests VEGF play a key role in the acquisition of the angiogenic phenotype in oral cancer cells. Western blotting of p53 and murine double mutant 2 (Mdm2) together with p53 DNA sequencing analysis indicate that p53 function loss by mutation or overexpression of Mdm2 occurred in all tested oral cancer cells regardless of their etiology. In summary, the angiogenic property of oral cancer cells is mediated by many factors in addition to VEGF and the functional status of p53",

    "Title": "Multiple head and neck tumors frequently originate from a single preneoplastic lesion",
    "Abstract": "The development of second primary tumors has a negative impact on the prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Previously, we detected genetically altered and tumor-related mucosal lesions in the resection margins in 25% of unselected head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients (Tabor MP, Brakenhoff RH, van Houten VMM, Kummer JA, Snel MHJ, Snijders PJF, Snow GB, Leemans CR, Braakhuis BJM: Persistence of genetically altered fields in head and neck cancer patients: biological and clinical implications. Clin Cancer Res 2001, 7: 1523-1532). The aim of this study was to determine whether first and second primary tumors are clonally related and originate from a single genetically altered field. From 10 patients we analyzed the first tumor of the oral cavity or oropharynx, the >3-cm remote second primary tumor, and the mucosa from the tumor-free margins from both resection specimens. We compared TP53 mutations and loss of heterozygosity profiles using 19 microsatellite markers at chromosomes 3p, 9p, 13q, and 17p. In all patients, genetically altered mucosal lesions were detected in at least one resection margin from both first and second primary tumor. Evidence for a common clonal origin of the first tumor, second primary tumor, and the intervening mucosa was found for at least 6 of 10 patients. Our results indicate that a proportion of multiple primary tumors have developed within a single preneoplastic field. Based on different etiology and clinical consequences, we propose that independent second primary tumors should be distinguished from second field tumors, that arise from the same genetically altered field the first tumor has developed from",

    "Abstract": "Assessment of the predictive value of p53 requires the testing of large numbers of samples from patients enrolled in prospective phase III clinical trials. The goal of this study was to determine whether p53 status can be determined by p53 yeast functional assay using the limiting amounts of material that can typically be obtained in prospective phase III trials (particularly when chemotherapy is given before surgery). All patients presenting with a clinically palpable tumour which could be considered large enough to perform a trucut biopsy (> or =2 cm breast tumour) were eligible for this study. Two trucut biopsies and one incisional biopsy were performed on the surgical specimens (mastectomy or tumourectomy). Samples were snap frozen and cryostat sections were taken for histology and p53 testing. Thirty patients were included. Three samples out of 90 failed to give any p53 PCR products, probably because these samples contained almost entirely fibrous tissue. Of the 87 samples that could be tested, the incisional and trucut biopsies results were fully concordant in every case. p53 could be defined in 97% of patients by double trucut biopsy. Eight out of 30 tumours tested were mutant for p53 (27%). p53 status can be reliably determined by yeast assay from single frozen sections of trucut biopsies. Histological examination before p53 testing is essential to exclude cases where the p53 result may reflect only the status of the normal cells in the biopsy",

    "Abstract": "Human cell lines established from biliary tract cancers are rare, and only five have been reported previously. We report the characterisation of six new six biliary tract cancer cell lines (designated SNU-245, SNU- 308, SNU-478, SNU-869, SNU-1079 and SNU-1196) established from primary tumour samples of Korean patients. The cell lines were isolated from two extrahepatic bile duct cancers (one adenocarcinoma of common bile duct, one hilar bile duct cancer), two adenocarcinomas of ampulla of Vater, one intrahepatic bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma), and one adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder. The cell phenotypes, including the histopathology of the primary tumours and in vitro growth characteristics, were determined. We also performed molecular characterisation, including DNA fingerprinting analysis and abnormalities of K-ras, p15, p16, p53, hMLH1, hMSH2, DPC4, beta- catenin, E-cadherin, hOGG1, STK11, and TGF-betaRII genes by PCR-SSCP and sequencing analysis. In addition, we compared the genetic alterations in tumour cell lines and their corresponding tumour tissues. All lines grew as adherent cells. Population doubling times varied from 48-72 h. The culture success rate was 20% (six out of 30 attempts). All cell lines showed (i) relatively high viability; (ii) absence of mycoplasma or bacteria contamination; and (iii) genetic heterogeneity by DNA fingerprinting analysis. Among the lines, three lines had p53 mutations; and homozygous deletions in both p16 and p15 genes were found three and three lines, respectively; one line had a heterozygous missense mutation in hMLH1; E-cadherin gene was hypermethylated in two lines. Since the establishment of biliary tract cancer cell lines has been rarely reported in the literature, these newly established and well characterised biliary tract cancer cell lines would be very useful for studying the biology of biliary tract cancers, particularly those related to hypermethylation of E-cadherin gene in biliary tract cancer",

    "Abstract": "The molecular mechanisms of Helicobacter pylori associated tumor development are poorly understood. The spectra of genetic alterations in neoplasms may provide clues to the molecular carcinogenesis of a tumor and may be relevant for the prognosis of the patients. We investigated the p53 mutation pattern and the protein expression of p53, c-erbB2, and c-met in 42 gastric cancers and correlated these alterations with H. pylori infection, histological subtypes and survival of the patients after curative resection. There were no differences in the incidences of the expression of p53, c-erbB2, and c- met in the tumor tissues according to H. pylori infection. Fifteen p53 mutations in 12 (29%) tumors were identified. More p53 mutations were found in patients with positive serology for H. pylori (43% vs 14%). This difference was not significant, but the small sample size may be insufficient to detect a potential statistical difference. There was neither a H. pylori-associated p53 hot-spot codon mutation nor a H. pylori characteristic mutational pattern of p53. Positive lymph nodes (P = 0.0061) and p53 mutations (P = 0.0035) were the only significant bad prognostic markers for survival after curative resection of the gastric cancers in our study. Our study does not indicate a unique molecular mechanism of p53 mutagenesis through H. pylori infection. The fact that p53 mutations were significantly correlated with poor survival of patients after potentially curative resection of gastric cancer may have clinical implications for multimodal therapies",

    "Title": "p53 Gene mutation and genetic instability in superficial multifocal esophageal squamous cell carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Tumor multicentricity is occasionally observed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We studied five surgically resected superficial multifocal esophageal SCCs for p53 gene mutation and genetic instability, using DNA extracted from microdissected areas. A total of 38 target areas (TAs) were analyzed in SCC, dysplasia, basal cell hyperplasia (BCH) and normal squamous epithelium. Analysis of the replication error (RER) at 10 microsatellite loci showed microsatellite instability in all TAs, as well as in normal squamous epithelium. p53 gene mutation was identified in 28.9% (11/38 TAs). All cases showed a common missense mutation in exon 8 at codon 273 (CGT-->CAT, Arg-->His), which was DNA contact mutation in the S10 beta strand. In association with microsatellite alterations, 7 of 9 TAs with p53 mutation in exon 8 at codon 273 also showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of p53 gene. LOH of p53 gene was detected in 83.8% (31/37 TAs). LOH at D2S123 on 2p16 near MSH2 gene and at D3S1611 on 3p22 near MLH1 gene was detected in 65.4% (17/26) and 71.4% (10/14) TAs, respectively. Frequencies of LOH at p53 and D2S123 were similar in non-cancerous areas and SCCs. LOH of p53 and D2S123 were found in 50% (5/10 TAs) of non-cancerous areas and 60% (9/15 TAs) of SCCs. Our results suggest that genetic instability induces esophageal tumor multicentricity, and that p53 gene contact mutation together with LOH are early events of the multistage carcinogenesis of multifocal primary esophageal SCC",

    "Title": "P53 mutations in colorectal cancer assessed in both genomic DNA and cDNA as compared to the presence of p53 LOH",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in p53 is a most common genetic alteration in human cancer and has been related to outcome, also in colorectal cancer. However, published results are not unanimous on this point without clear-cut explanations. Different analytical methods have been applied which could explain some discrepancies. Another factor of importance may be the source of nucleic acids used for identification of sequence alterations. Therefore we compared mutations in exons 7 and 8 of p53 found in genomic DNA, with mutations in cDNA from the same patients and evaluated to what extent LOH and mutations in p53 occurred simultaneously, which are prerequisites for a complete loss of p53 function according to the classic concept. cDNA and genomic DNA from tumor tissue from 123 patients were used. Thirty-four mutations were found in both tumor cDNA and genomic DNA. Twenty missense mutations were the same in both cDNA and genomic DNA. Two missense mutations, one 1 bp deletion and one nonsense mutation were only found in genomic DNA, while nine missense mutations and one 9 bp deletion were found in cDNA only. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference among mutations in cDNA and genomic DNA (p=1.00). Only 2 patients (5%) had both LOH and mutations in exons 2-11 of p53. One patient had LOH without p53 mutation, while 18 patients (44%) showed p53 mutation without LOH and 20 patients (49%) had wt p53 without LOH. Forty-four patients (52%) were non-informative for LOH of the entire cohort consisting of 85 patients. Our findings suggest that different results reported on the role mutated p53 may have in colorectal cancer are probably not explained by the source of nucleic acids (RNA vs DNA) for sequence determinations. Rather, unknown information about simultaneous but different presence of p53 LOH in previously published reports is more likely. However, an unexpectedly infrequent occurrence (5-10%) of complete and isolated p53 ablation (LOH + mutation) would demand considerably larger patient populations (1500-2000 patients) than ever published for relating p53 function to survival in patients with colorectal cancer. Therefore, the role of p53 dysfunction in progression of colorectal cancer remains uncertain",

    "Title": "Prevalence of microsatellite instability, inactivation of mismatch repair genes, p53 mutation, and human papillomavirus infection in Korean oral cancer patients",
    "Abstract": "To determine the etiologic factors of human oral cancer, we examined the prevalence of microsatellite instability (MSI), the inactivation of mismatch repair (MMR) genes, p53 mutation, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (HPV-16, -18, and -33) in 86 Korean oral cancer specimens, including 76 squamous cell carcinomas and 10 salivary gland tumors. MSI was observed in 3 of the 76 squamous cell carcinomas (4%) and 2 of 10 salivary gland tumors (20%). As MSI is a hallmark of the inactivation of the MMR genes, the genetic status of hMSH2 and hMLH1, and hypermethylation of the hMLH1 promoter region were investigated in oral cancers displaying MSI. Inactivation of the hMLH1 gene by either mutation or hypermethylation was observed 4 of the 5 MSI oral cancers. Mutation of the p53 gene was found in 11 of 76 squamous cell carcinomas (14.5%) but not in the salivary gland tumors. PCR assay revealed the presence of HPV DNA in 11 of the 76 squamous cell carcinomas (14.5%) and 4 of the 10 salivary gland tumors (40%). Type 18 HPV DNA was predominant in 11 of the HPV-infected squamous cell carcinomas (72.7%) and 4 of the HPV-infected salivary gland tumors (50%). Two squamous cell carcinoma tissues were found both to be HPV-infected and to harbor the p53 mutation. Our results suggest: i) that MSI plays a role in the pathogenesis of Korean oral cancers, squamous cell carcinomas (4%) and salivary gland tumors (20%); ii) that genetic alteration or hypermethylation of the hMLH1 gene may be the principal inactivating mechanism in Korean oral cancer with MSI; and iii) that inactivation of the p53 gene by either mutation or HPV infection is frequent in Korean squamous cell carcinomas (26%) and salivary gland tumors (40%)",

    "Title": "Association of p53 mutations, microvessel density and neoangiogenesis in pairs of colorectal cancers and corresponding liver metastases",
    "Abstract": "p53 suppressor gene mutations are a well known step which occurs in the late stages of the complex tumourigenesis of colorectal cancer. A deregulation of p53 protein function may be associated with increased neovascularization and aggressive tumour growth. In vitro studies have shown that these genetic alterations cause a loss of wild-type p53- induced anti-angiogenetic control and could possibly induce expression of the neoangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Therefore, this in vivo study was performed to assess p53 mutations, i.e. hot spots in exons 4-9, in primary colorectal cancers and in corresponding liver metastases in order to test whether there is an association between p53 mutated tumours with increased microvessel density (MVD) and VEGF overexpression. Twenty-two tissue samples taken from primary colorectal cancers and the corresponding liver metastases were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and fixed in formaldehyde. After DNA extraction exons 4-9 were amplified and directly sequenced. Cryostat sections were stained immunohistochemically using antibodies against VEGF, CD34, and p53 protein. A modified semiquantitative Weidner score and interactive computerized image analysis was used to assess MVD. Overexpression of immunohistochemically detected p53 protein was found in 7 of the 11 primary tumours and liver metastases (64%). Sequencing showed 3 out of 11 primary tumours (27%) and 5 out of 11 liver metastases (46%) to have p53 point or frameshift mutations; these samples tested immunohistochemically positive for p53 protein. Two p53 mutations in samples of liver metastases were not detectable in the corresponding primaries. We detected one frameshift mutation in exon 4 that has not yet been described in the literature. Tumour samples with p53 mutations and increased VEGF immunoreactivity were associated with higher MVD (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). However, there was no association detected immunohistochemically between p53 and MVD as well as p53 mutations and VEGF overexpression. Our data demonstrate specific genetic alterations in the coding regions of p53 suppressor gene in both primary colorectal cancers and corresponding liver metastases, these alterations are associated with an increase in MVD, but not in VEGF overexpression. In addition, a novel frameshift mutation in both colorectal cancer and metastasis is described",

    "Title": "Genetic alterations in adenoma-carcinoma sequencing of intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas",
    "Abstract": "We investigated the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm from the aspect of genetic changes. The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumors and surrounding normal pancreatic tissues from patients with 16 intraductal papillary-mucinous adenoma of the pancreas (IPMA) and 10 intraductal papillary-mucinous carcinoma of the pancreas (IPMC) were provided for DNA extraction after microdissection. SSCP-DNA sequencing analysis demonstrated K-ras mutations at codon 12 in 75% of IPMA and 70% of IPMC, while those at codon 13 were observed neither in IPMA nor IPMC. There were no characteristic K-ras mutation types in IPMA and IPMC and no significant differences in incidence of K-ras mutations between the two categories. The frequencies of p53 mutations analyzed by SSCP-DNA sequencing were not high in IPMA (18.8%) and IPMC (30%), showing no significant difference between them. LOHs of APC in IPMA and IPMC were infrequent (6.3 and 20%, respectively) and showed no significant difference in incidence between the two categories. The LOH frequencies of DCC in IPMA and IPMC were 31.3 and 40%, respectively, and were not statistically different from each other. Taken together, genetic changes such as K-ras, p53, APC and DCC mutations may not be associated with adenoma-carcinoma sequence in intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm of pancreas",

    "Title": "Mutations of TP53 do not correlate with the sensitivity to paclitaxel-a study using 27 gynaecological cancer cell lines",
    "Abstract": "The correlation between inactivation of the TP53 gene through mutation or the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA and intrinsic paclitaxel sensitivity was studied in 27 gynaecological cancer cell lines. IC(50) values, as a measure of drug sensitivity, were determined using a 96-well clonogenic assay. TP53 mutations were investigated with polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct DNA sequencing. HPV status was studied with PCR using HPV consensus primers. TP53 mutations were found in 7/11 vulvar SCC cell lines. Only 2/9 endometrial and 1/7 ovarian cancer cell lines carried TP53 mutations. One vulvar and one endometrial cancer cell line were HPV-positive; both carrying HPV type-16 DNA. Thus, TP53 was functionally normal in 3/11 vulvar, 6/9 endometrial and 6/7 ovarian cancer cell lines. The IC(50) values for paclitaxel were 0.60-2.9, 0.49-2.3 and 0.40-3.4 nM in the vulvar, endometrial and ovarian cancer cell lines, respectively. No correlation could be demonstrated between inactivation of the TP53 gene and paclitaxel sensitivity in vitro; the cell lines were evaluated as one group or according to their anatomical origin or histology. Previous reports have given inconclusive results, partly due to the cell types used, i.e. normal, cancerous or transformed cells. Our results support the view that paclitaxel sensitivity of tumour-derived cancer cell lines is not related to the TP53 status",

    "Title": "TP53 mutation pattern of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas in a high risk area (Southern Brazil): role of life style factors",
    "Abstract": "In an attempt to correlate the TP53 mutation pattern of squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus (ESCC) and life style factors of patients from the high risk area Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 135 ESCC were analyzed, after prescreening by p53 immunohistochemistry, by SSCP and DNA sequencing of TP53, exon 5-9. Forty-nine somatic TP53 mutations (and 1 case with p53 polymorphism) were identified as missense (n = 39), frameshift (n = 6), silent (n = 1), amber (n = 1) or intron border mutations (n = 2) that cause splicing aberrations. They were preferentially found in exon 5 (36.7%) and exon 8 (32.7%). Several mutations were located in the mutation hot spot codons 248, 273 and 282, mainly at CpG sites. Transition mutations were observed in 53.1% (among them 50% G > A), transversion mutations in 34.7% (among them 47.1% G > T) and frameshifts in 12.2%, the latter 2 mainly in smokers and alcohol drinkers. Transitions were more prevalent in females than in males (p < 0.05). TP53 mutations, mainly transversions, were more frequently found in heavy smokers (p = 0.03), with the same tendency after chronic alcohol consumption. Comparison with the worldwide IARC database disclosed differences in the TP53 mutation pattern of the Brazilian tumors, with a higher accumulation of TP53 mutations in exon 8 and a higher prevalence of transition mutations. Mutations at the reported hot spot codon 176 were missing. Although difficult because of the documented coexposure to various life style risk factors in most patients of this series, the hypothesis is proposed that besides smoking and alcohol drinking the commonly consumed hot mate tea in this high risk area for ESCC is responsible for this different pattern of TP53 mutations because of chronic hyperthermic irritation and inflammation in the esophagus with an endogenous formation of radicals or carcinogenic factors that lead to a higher prevalence of transition mutations",

    "Abstract": "The tumour-suppressor protein p53 belongs to a family that includes 2 structurally related proteins, p63 and p73. Because of their structural homology, it has been hypothesized that both homologues serve as 'spare mechanisms' in p53 mutations to regulate the cell cycle by inducing apoptosis. We investigated the mutational and protein expression status of p53 in correlation to its homologues, p73 and p63, in primary and recurrent squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) and corresponding nonneoplastic mucosa. Expression and mutation of p53 and its homologues p63 (including the 2 major isotypes TAp63 and DeltaNp63) and p73 was examined by direct DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry in 29 primary and 39 recurrent (secondary) HNSCCs after microdissection. Our results were correlated with pathohistologic stage and grade. p53 mutations were detected in 32/68 (47%) carcinomas of 17 patients, with a discordant mutation pattern of primary and consecutive tumours in all cases. Positive immunostaining for p63 was found in 55/68 (81%) carcinomas of 29 patients. Immunohistochemistry revealed p73 protein expression in 32/68 (47%) tumours. In normal mucosa, p63 and p73 were expressed in 40/68 (59%) and 12/68 (18%) cases, respectively. We failed to detect specific mutations of p73 or p63 in primary and recurrent carcinoma of the head and neck. p73 and p63 were rarely mutated in HNSCC, but both were expressed in a subset of tumours. The lack of correlation between p73/p63 and p53 protein expression suggests that neither p73 nor p63 can replace p53 when it is mutated",

    "Title": "Prognostic value of P53 mutations in rectal carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "The influence of p53 mutations on the response to ionizing radiation and survival was retrospectively evaluated in patients treated with preoperative radiotherapy for rectal carcinoma. From 1989 to 1991, 86 rectal cancer patients treated by preoperative radiotherapy were included in this series. For all patients, endorectal sonography (to define ultrasonography TNM [uTNM]) was performed before treatment; 19 patients were classified as stage 1, 27 as stage 2 and 40 as stage 3. Response to radiotherapy (39 Gy in 13 fractions delivered in 17 days) was assessed by comparing the uT and the T obtained by histologic examination of the resected specimen (TNM classification). A rectal cancer biopsy was performed before treatment and enabled the search for p53 mutations by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing. The status of the p53 gene was correlated with the response to radiotherapy and survival. Forty-nine percent of the tumors presented abnormal DGGE profiles. The prevalence of p53 mutations was significantly higher in patients who did not respond to radiotherapy (63%) than in those who did respond (34%) (p < 0.01). Presence of a p53 mutation was associated with significantly shorter 5-year survival compared to patients without mutations (p < 0.02). In a multivariate analysis, p53 mutation status remained a prognostic factor independent of tumor posttreatment staging (p < 0.05). p53 status is an independent prognostic factor of response to radiotherapy and survival in rectal carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "We examined the p53 status of 108 NSCLCs compared to the expression of MLH1 and MSH2 proteins. p53 overexpression was demonstrated by IHC in 64% of patients examined, whereas p53 mutations were detected in 43%. Twenty-two percent of mutations were located outside of the hot-spot (exons 5-8) area. p53 mutations and overexpression were more frequent in SCCL (57% and 73%, respectively) than in lung adenocarcinomas (22% and 50%, respectively). In NSCLC-carrying wild-type p53, increased expression of MSH2 correlated with p53 overexpression (p = 0.018). In addition, in SCCL, p53 mutations correlated with reduced MSH2 expression (p = 0.019). These data suggest a relationship between p53 and MSH2. While there is evidence for p53 being a transcriptional activator of MSH2, the hypothesis that MSH2 acts as a DNA-damage signaller triggering p53 overexpression needs to be clarified in future studies",

    "Title": "TP53 mutations in breast cancer tumors of patients from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: association with risk factors and tumor characteristics",
    "Abstract": "Somatic mutations in the TP53 gene are the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human malignancies, including breast cancer, which is one of the leading causes of death among women in Brazil. In our study, we determined the frequency and the pattern of TP53 mutations in malignant breast tumors from 120 patients living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. TP53 mutations were found in 20% of the tumors, which contained a diversity of mutation types: missense (62.5%), nonsense (8.3%), silent (4.2%), intronic (12.5%), insertion (4.2%) and deletion (8.3%). Of a total of 15 missense mutations, 4 were observed at Arg248 and 2 at Cys242, which are directly involved in DNA binding and in zinc binding, respectively. A subgroup of 51 patients was analyzed with respect to the relation between the presence of TP53 mutations and classical risk factors and with tumor and patient characteristics. For this analysis, we used logistic regression and, in order to obtain more precise confidence intervals, they were recalculated using a bootstrap resampling technique. Our results demonstrate that these mutations are not statistically associated with the risk factors or the patients' characteristics. However, the presence of TP53 mutations is strongly associated with the aggressiveness of the tumors, measured by Elston classification (OR = 11.97 and 95% CI of 2.24-307.05). This finding is in agreement with previous studies, which report the presence of TP53 mutations in tumors with poor prognosis. This correlation between tumor aggressiveness and TP53 mutations could be a crucial variable for the treatment and prognosis of breast cancer",

    "Title": "Mutation analysis and mRNA expression of trail-receptors in human breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "The chromosome region 8p12-p22 shows frequent allelic loss in a variety of human malignancies, including breast cancer (BC). The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-receptors TRAIL-R1, -R2, -R3 and -R4 are located on 8p21-p22 and might be candidate tumor suppressor genes in this region. To evaluate the involvement of TRAIL receptors in breast carcinogenesis, we have analyzed the entire coding region of TRAIL-R2 and the death domain (DD) regions of TRAIL-R1 and -R4 for the detection of somatic mutations in a series of breast tumors, lymph node metastases and BC cell lines. Overall, we detected 1, 11 and 3 alterations in the TRAIL-R1, -R2 and -R4 genes, respectively. Although functional studies have not yet been performed, we assume that most of these alterations do not alter the function of TRAIL-receptors. Additionally, we analyzed individuals from BC families for the detection of TRAIL-R2 germline mutations. One alteration has been found in the Kozak consensus motif at position -4 with respect to the translation initiation AUG [1-4 (C-->A)]. We further studied the mRNA expression of TRAIL and the 4 TRAIL receptors. In BC cell lines, a strongly decreased mRNA expression of TRAIL, TRAIL-R1, -R3 and -R4 was found, whereas the expression of TRAIL-R2 was only slightly reduced. In breast tumors, a 1.2-3.6-fold reduction of mRNA signals of the 5 genes was observed. No correlation was found between the expression level of TRAIL and the receptor mRNAs and clinicopathologic variables and between the expression of TRAIL-R2 and TP53 mutation status and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 8p21-p22. Taken together, we cannot exclude the involvement of TRAIL-receptors in BC. Our mutation studies indicate that DD receptor mutations occur at low frequency and are not the primary cause for the altered mRNA expression of TRAIL and TRAIL-receptors in BC",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this multicenter prospective study was to evaluate the role of intratumoral parameters related to fluorouracil (FU) sensitivity in 103 metastatic colorectal cancer patients receiving FU-folinic acid. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Liver metastatic biopsy specimens were obtained for all patients and primary tumor biopsy specimens for 54 patients. Thymidylate synthase (TS), folylpolyglutamate synthetase, and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase were measured by radioenzymatic assays; TS promoter polymorphism (2R/2R v 2R/3R v 3R/3R) was determined by polymerase chain reaction; and p53 protein and mutations were analyzed by immunoluminometric assay and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, respectively. RESULTS: p53 mutations were observed in 56.7% of metastases. TS activity was significantly higher in 2R/3R tumors as compared with 2R/2R or 3R/3R. TS activity in metastasis was the only parameter linked to clinical responsiveness (responders exhibited the lower TS, P =.047). Univariate Cox analyses demonstrated that TS activity in primary tumor (the greater the TS, the poorer the survival; P =.040), TS promoter polymorphism in primary tumor (risk of death of 2R/3R v 2R/2R, 2.68; P =.035), and p53 stop mutation in metastasis (risk of death of stop mutations v wild type, 3.14; P =.018) were the only significant biologic predictors of specific survival. Stepwise analysis did not discriminate between TS activity and TS polymorphism. CONCLUSION: Present results confirm the value of tumoral TS activity for predicting FU responsiveness, point out the importance of detailed p53 mutation analysis for predicting survival, and suggest that TS genotype in primary tumor carries a prognostic value similar to that of TS activity",

    "Abstract": "In Singapore astrocytic tumours occur in only 25% of patients with primary brain tumours compared to 40-60% in other series. Glioblastoma multiforme arises either de novo as a primary glioblastomas associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mdm2 over-expression or as a secondary glioblastomas, through malignant progression from low-grade astrocytomas, associated with p53 mutations and PDGFR-alpha over-expression. Using immunohistochemical methods and DNA sequencing, we studied our population of glioblastomas for overexpression of EGFR, mdm2, p53, and PDGFR-alpha as well directly for mutations of the p53 gene. While levels of over-expression of EGFR and mdm2 were consistent with levels expected for primary glioblastomas, levels of p53 and PDGFR-alpha were consistent with levels documented for secondary glioblastomas. Notably 96% of the samples over-expressed p53 as detected with monoclonal antibody pAb 240. Of the 39 samples available for DNA sequencing 18% (7/39) had p53 mutations, including three mutations previously undocumented in glioblastomas. These results provide strong evidence that glioblastomas in Asian patients do not conform to currently accepted models of glioblastoma development, and that clinically defined glioblastomas in these patients show genetic changes consistent with both 'primary' and 'secondary' glioblastomas",

METHODS: There were 31 patients enrolled in this study between 1995 and 1998. All patients had received radiotherapy but none of them had undergone chemotherapy or local salvage surgery previously. RESULTS: The p53 status of each tumor was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and by sequencing of exons 5 to 8 (codons 126-306). Five (16.1%) of 31 patients had mutations in the p53 gene, of which 2 were non-sense mutations, 2 were transition mutations, and 1 was a frameshift deletion mutation. The majority of the p53 mutations were found in exon 5. There is no significant difference in the incidence of p53 mutation compared with that of the previous reports for the primary disease. Based on the clinicopathologic data, there was no specific difference found between these 5 patients and the others. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that p53 mutation is an infrequent event and may have no essential role in recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinomas",

We therefore investigated whether such mutations occur in malignant melanomas and, if so, whether they are linked to ultraviolet (sun) light exposure. For the first time, mutations in mucosal membranes and adjacent tissues shielded from sunlight were compared with those in cutaneous melanomas from sun-exposed skin. Archival tissues were obtained from 35 patients with a primary melanoma taken from unexposed mucosal areas and from 34 patients with a primary melanoma located in chronically sun-exposed head and neck skin. was characterized by means of polymerase chain reaction amplification and single-strand conformation polymorphism assay followed by nucleotide sequencing. The results showed that 17.6% of the primary cutaneous and 28.6% of the primary mucosal melanomas had point mutations in. Among the cutaneous melanomas, one showed three mutations in exon 7, and one had two mutations in exon 5; the mutation was in the same allele in both cases. One mucosal melanoma had two mutations in exon 7, both in the same allele, and another had two mutations, one in exon 7 and one in intron 6, both in the same allele. C<--T mutations at dipyrimidine sites, considered fingerprints for ultraviolet light-induced mutations, were about equally distributed among patients with melanomas from chronically sun-exposed areas (six out of nine; 67%) and those with melanomas from unexposed mucosal areas and adjacent skin (eight out of 14; 57%). Our data, demonstrating the presence of such mutations even in melanomas from mucosal membranes, clearly suggest that factors other than, or additional to, ultraviolet radiation are operational in the induction of mutations in melanomas",

    "Title": "Bcl-6 p53 mutations in lymphomas carrying the bcl-2/Jh rearrangement",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES. The t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation is the hallmark of follicular lymphomas (FL). The translocation induces the overexpression of the Bcl-2 protein and prolongs the survival of clonogenic cells. Tumor cells may acquire additional molecular alterations that may be associated with histologic progression or with chemo-resistance. DESIGN AND METHODS. We analyzed the distribution and association of bcl-6 and p53 mutations in 55 consecutive bcl-2/Jh+ lymphoma samples derived from 43 patients obtained at the time of diagnosis and, in 5 of these patients, during follow-up. A total of 29 bcl-6 point mutations were detected in seventeen patients (40%) associated with major or minor breakpoints of the bcl-2/Jh fusion gene. In seven cases a p53 mutation was detected. Three cases corresponded to FL with the minor breakpoint in the bcl-2 gene and these patients had a favorable clinical evolution, whereas the 4 patients with p53 mutations and the major breakpoint had a bad clinical outcome with morphologic transformation to high-grade lymphoma in three cases. The sequential analysis of 5 patients showed a different timing in the acquisition of mutations: one patient showed bcl-6 and p53 mutations at diagnosis, another patient showed bcl-6 mutations at diagnosis and acquired a p53 mutation later whereas the third patient had a p53 mutation before the appearance of the bcl-6 mutation. RESULTS. We did not find significant differences in survival between patients with FL who showed exclusively bcl-6 mutations and those without bcl-6 mutations, but those patients with a high International Progostic Index score and p53 mutations showed the lowest overall survival (p = 0.002). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS. These findings suggest that bcl-2/Jh lymphomas show molecular heterogeneity and that bcl-6 and p53 mutations may be acquired during the evolution of such lymphomas. Bcl-6 mutations, by themselves, do not seem to be associated with a bad prognosis. Rearrangements at the minor bcl-2 locus may have a different molecular evolution",

    "Title": "Genetic evidence for the multi-step progression of mixed glandular- neuroendocrine gastric carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "A mixed glandular-neuroendocrine gastric carcinoma shows discrete, juxtaposed areas of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma. In order to gain insight into the genetic events and clonality associated with the dual differentiation of a mixed gastric carcinoma, eight cases (two true composite and six neuroendocrine-dominant carcinomas) were examined by analyzing the genome-wide loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Of the eight mixed gastric carcinomas, one true composite and five neuroendocrine-dominant carcinomas showed a primary LOH that was shared by both the glandular and neuroendocrine components and a secondary LOH or mutations that were restricted to the neuroendocrine components. The glandular components contained mixed cell populations with or without primary LOH events, suggesting that a primary LOH arose during adenocarcinoma progression and that the LOH-positive cell served as a precursor for a neuroendocrine carcinoma. The neuroendocrine components were of a homogeneous population with various genetic alterations such as a LOH, p53 mutations, and microsatellite instability-associated transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta RII mutation. Therefore, most (six of eight cases) mixed glandular-neuroendocrine gastric carcinomas were likely to have sequentially evolved from a glandular precursor to a genetically heterogeneous adenocarcinoma and then to neuroendocrine differentiation. Two components of the other true composite carcinomas were shown to have reciprocally lost different alleles of identical loci on multiple chromosomes, suggesting that, occasionally (one of eight cases), dual differentiation concurrently arises from a single precursor, possibly as a result of non-disjunctional cell division",

    "Abstract": "The tumor-suppressor protein p53 has recently been shown to belong to a family that includes two structurally related proteins, p63 and p73. In contrast to p53, p63 and p73 play an essential role in epithelial development, stem cell identity and cellular differentiation. Salivary gland tumors carry a wide spectrum of histopathological forms, which may share a common single-cell origin from the epithelial progenitor basal duct cells and have a different tendency of malignant progression. This study was performed to examine the expression of p53, p63, and p73 in benign salivary gland tumors. Expression and mutation of p53, p73, and p63 were examined by direct DNA sequencing, reverse transcription PCR using isoform-specific primers, and by immunohistochemistry in normal parotid tissue ( n=10), and various tumors of the salivary gland (42 pleomorphic adenomas, 12 myoepitheliomas, 8 basal cell adenomas, 5 oncocytomas, 5 canalicular adenomas, and 20 adenolymphomas). In normal parotid tissue the expression of p63 and p73 was restricted to few basal and myoepithelial cells. Ductal luminal and acinus cells were completely negative for the expression of all three family members. In contrast, in salivary gland tumors, strong nuclear staining for p63 and p73 was observed. Myoepithelial and basaloid cells and the basal epithelial layer of adenolyphomas and oncocytomas were positive for p63 and also, to a lesser extent, to p73. Mutations of p53 were detected in 4 of 42 (10%) pleomorphic adenomas, in 3 of 12 (25%) myoepitheliomas, and in 1 of 8 (13%) basal cell adenomas but not in other tumors. We failed to detect specific mutations of p63 and p73. Using isoform-specific PCR, we found that all isoforms of p63 were expressed in normal parotid tissue whereas the pleomorphic adenomas, myoepitehliomas, and basal cell adenomas dominantly expressed the transactivation-incompetent truncated isoforms. Our data indicate that p63 and p73 are upregulated in salivary gland tumors and may serve as a marker of epithelial and myoepithelial progenitor cells in salivary glands. The prevalence of p53 mutations and the observation of the expression of DeltaNp63 isoforms only in pleomorphic adenomas, myoepitheliomas, and also basal cell adenomas may reflect their possible malignant potential",

    "Title": "CagA status of Helicobacter pylori infection and p53 gene mutations in gastric adenocarcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) increases stomach cancer risk. Helicobacter pylori strains with the cag pathogenicity island (PAI) induce more severe inflammation in the gastric epithelium and are more strongly associated with stomach cancer risk than strains lacking the PAI. We examined whether the prevalence of somatic p53 mutation in gastric adenocarcinoma differed between subjects with and without infection with CagA(+) (a marker for the PAI) H. pylori strains. DNA from 105 microdissected tumor specimens was analyzed for mutation in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene by polymerase chain reaction-based single- strand conformation polymorphism followed by direct DNA sequencing. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for IgG antibodies against H. pylori and CagA were performed on sera collected 2-31 years prior to cancer diagnosis. Tumors from CagA(+) subjects were significantly more likely to have p53 mutations than tumors from CagA(-) subjects (including H. pylori- and H. pylori(+)/CagA(-)): odds ratio = 3.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-13.07 after adjustment for histologic type and anatomic subsite of tumor and age at diagnosis and sex of subjects. Mutations were predominantly insertions and deletions (43%) as well as transition mutations at CpG dinucleotides (33%). The data suggest that CagA(+) H. pylori infection, when compared with CagA(-) infection or the absence of H. pylori infection, is associated with a higher prevalence of p53 mutation in gastric adenocarcinoma",

    "Title": "Genetic status of cell cycle regulators in squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus: the CDKN2A (p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) ) and p53 genes are major targets for inactivation",
    "Abstract": "We determined inactivation of the CDKN2A (p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF)) gene in 21 cases of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The tumours were also analysed for mutations in exons 5-8 and allelic losses in the p53 gene. In addition, we screened the CDKN2B (p15 INK4b), CDKN2C (p18 INK4c), CDK4 and p53R2 genes for mutations in the tumour tissues. Besides concomitant alterations in the CDKN2A and p53 loci in more than half of the cases, our results showed that in 18 OSCC (86%) the CDKN2A (p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) ) gene was affected through mutations, homozygous/hemizygous deletions and promoter hypermethylation. Eight out of 10 tumours with mutations or promoter hypermethylation specific to the CDKN2A/p16 INK4a gene showed loss of the wild-type allele. One tumour with a single base deletion in the N-terminus (codon 8) of the CDKN2A/p16(INK4a) gene carried a novel germ-line mutation or a rare polymorphism (Ile51Met) in exon 2 of the CDK4 gene. Promoter hypermethylation in the CDKN2A/p14 ARF gene was detected in 11 tumours. In the p53 gene 15 mutations were detected in 14 tumours. We detected an inverse relationship between CDKN2A/p16 INK4a inactivation and frequency of loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.98; Fisher exact test, P-value approximately 0.03). Screening of nine exons of the p53R2 [Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) official name RRM2B] gene resulted in identification of a novel polymorphism in the 5' untranslated region, which was detected in four cases. Our results suggest that the CDKN2A (p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) ) and p53 genes involved in the two cell cycle pathways are major and independent targets of inactivation in OSCC",

    "Title": "Splenic small B-cell lymphoma with predominant red pulp involvement: a diffuse variant of splenic marginal zone lymphoma?",
    "Abstract": "AIMS: Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) has been characterized by a micronodular pattern of infiltration, biphasic cytology, follicular replacement and the presence of marginal zone differentiation. Here we describe four cases with some distinctive features, such as diffuse splenic infiltration, lack of micronodules, marginal zone cytology, p53 inactivation and cutaneous involvement. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the course of a review of cases of SMZL, we recognized the existence of a subset of four cases of splenic B-cell lymphoma, with predominantly red pulp involvement, absence of follicular replacement, and a monomorphous population of tumoral cells resembling marginal zone B-cells, with scattered nucleolated blast cells. The immunophenotype (bcl2+, CD5-, CD10-, CD43-, CD23-, cyclin D1-, IgD- (3/4)) was consistent with SMZL. Bone marrow infiltration (4/4) and peripheral blood involvement (2/4) showed similar findings to those described for SMZL in these locations. However, unlike classical SMZL, 2/4 had cutaneous involvement, and 4/4 cases showed either p53 mutation or anomalous p53 staining (p53+, p21- ). CONCLUSIONS; In spite of a diffuse pattern of splenic infiltration, cutaneous involvement and p53 alterations, these cases have findings that overlap with those corresponding to classic SMZL (symptomatology, morphology of bone marrow, lymph nodes, peripheral blood involvement, and immunophenotype). We suggest that these cases be considered a putative variant of SMZL",

    "Title": "Mutations of the p53 and PTCH gene in basal cell carcinomas: UV mutation signature and strand bias",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of p53 and PTCH gene, two candidate tumor suppressor genes for basal cell carcinoma (BCC), were screened in 15 cases of sporadic BCCs that developed in sun-exposed skin region in a Korean population. p53 and PTCH mutations were detected at a frequency of 33 and 40%, respectively, and the mutations were predominantly UV-signature transition, C-->T transitions at dipyrimidine sites and CC-->TT tandem mutations. In both genes, the most common mutations were missense mutations resulting in amino acid substitution, which is different than the results from Caucasian BCCs where mutations are frequently predicted to make truncated or absent proteins. All mutations, except for one, occurred on the nontranscribed strand where is little efficient removal of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers relative to the transcribed strand. Loss of heterozygocity (LOH) of 9q22 for PTCH loci was found in eight of 15 informative cases of BCCs (53%), but none of the cases were informative for LOH of 17p13 for p53 loci. Not only do our data indicate the key role played by p53 and PTCH in the development of BCCs, these findings also suggest that UVB may significantly contribute to BCC tumorigenesis. Moreover, molecular epidemiology composed of incidence of p53 and PTCH mutations, difference in the type of mutation and repair bias of UV-induced DNA lesions might affect the distinct features of BCCs between different racial population",

    "Abstract": "This is the first investigation performed to detect the presence of the p53 mutation in Malay patients with gliomas. The p53 gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from 33 fresh-frozen tumour tissues from patients histologically confirmed as glioma. Four hot spot areas that lie between exon 5 to 8 were screened for mutation by mean of non-isotopic &quot;cold&quot; single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing. The frequency of p53 gene mutation in gliomas examined was 33% (11 of 33). Five (45.5%) cases had mutation in exon 7, four (36.4%) had mutation in exon 8 and two (18.1%) had mutation in exon 6. Seven (63.6%) of 11 mutations were single nucleotide point mutations of which 5 were missense mutations, 1 was nonsense mutation and 1 was, silent mutation. Three (27.3%) showed insertion mutation and 1 (9.1%) showed deletion mutation. Of the point mutations, 57.1% were transitions and 42.9% were transversions. These results suggested that p53 mutations frequently occur in gliomas and this gene does play an important role in the tumourigenesis process of Malay patients with brain tumours",

    "Abstract": "We characterized four pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (designated SNU- 213, SNU-324, SNU-410, and SNU-494) established from histopathologically varied primary or liver metastatic tumor samples of Korean patients. Three cell lines grew as adherent monolayers and one as adherent and floating cell clumps. All lines had: (1) relatively high viability; (2) an absence of mycoplasma or bacterial contamination; (3) genetic heterogeneity as assessed by DNA- fingerprinting analysis; (4) an absence of MADH4 mutation. Among the lines, three lines had mutations in codon 12 in K- ras, two lines harbored p53 mutations within the DNA-binding domain; two lines had homozygous deletions in both p16 and p15 genes; and one line had a missense mutation. Two lines (SNU-324 and SNU-410) had genetic alterations in the TGFBR2 gene: the SNU-324 line had a -1-bp or +1-bp mutation in 10-bp polydeoxyadenine repeat tracts; the SNU-410 line had a genomic deletion in this gene. Mutation analysis of mismatch repair genes demonstrated that SNU-324 has two heterozygous missense mutations in different exons of the hMLH1 gene. In addition, this line showed microsatellite instability and harbored frameshift mutations in simple repeated sequences of the coding regions of the TGFBR2, BAX, and hMSH3 genes. These defects of microsatellite instability and mismatch repair genes suggest the possibility of a new mutator phenotype for pancreatic carcinogenesis. These cell lines should be very useful for studying the biology of pancreatic carcinoma, particularly those related to mutator phenotype and genetic alterations in the TGFBR2 gene",

    "Title": "Aberrant p53, mdm2, and proliferation differ in glioblastomas from long- term compared with typical survivors",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly lethal neoplasm with a median survival of approximately 1 year. Only 2-5% of patients originally diagnosed with GBM will survive > or = 3 years. Whether tumors from these long-term survivors (LTSs) exhibit molecular genetic differences compared with typical GBM survivors is not known. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumors from 41 patients initially diagnosed with GBM and having survival > or = 3 years (LTS) was compared with 48 GBMs from short-term survivors (STSs, survival < or = 1.5 years) for p53 aberrations (expression/mutation), epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression, mdm2 overexpression, and proliferation index. RESULTS: Nuclear p53 expression was significantly more frequent in the LTS group. However, no difference in the rate of p53 mutation was evident. Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor was slightly more frequent in the STS patients, but this is not statistically different. mdm2 overexpression was significantly more frequent in the STSs, and this group had a significantly higher median proliferation index. CONCLUSION: Long-term GBM survivors were more likely to have p53- overexpressing tumors, although a difference in p53 mutation rate could not be detected. They were less likely to exhibit mdm2 overexpression and had a lower proliferation rate compared with typical GBM survivors",

    "Title": "Correlation of histology and molecular genetic analysis of 1p, 19q, 10q, TP53, EGFR, CDK4, and CDKN2A in 91 astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The histological diagnosis of human gliomas is of great importance for estimating patient prognosis and guiding therapy but suffers from being subjective and, therefore, variable. We hypothesized that molecular genetic analysis could provide a more objective means to classify tumors and, thus, reduce diagnostic variability. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed molecular genetic analysis on 91 nonselected gliomas for 1p, 19q, 10q, TP53, epidermal growth factor receptor, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 abnormalities and compared with the consensus diagnoses established among four independent neuropathologists. RESULTS: There were six astrocytomas, seven anaplastic astrocytomas, 45 glioblastomas, 21 oligodendrogliomas, eight anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, three oligoastrocytomas, and one anaplastic oligoastrocytoma. Twenty-nine cases had either 1p or 19qloss of heterozygosity (LOH) while retaining both copies of 10q, of which 25 (86%) were histologically oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, or anaplastic oligoastrocytoma. As for the oligodendroglial tumors, unanimous agreement of the initial diagnoses was almost restricted to those cases with combined 1p/19qLOH, whereas all nine tumors without 1p loss initially received variable diagnoses. Interestingly, TP53 mutation was inversely related to 1pLOH in all gliomas (P = 0.0003) but not 19qLOH (P = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that molecular genetic analysis of 1p/19q/10q/TP53 has significant diagnostic value, especially in detecting oligodendroglial tumors. In addition, 1pLOH and TP53 mutations in gliomas may be markers of oligodendroglial and astrocytic pathways, respectively, which may separate gliomas with the same histological diagnosis, especially oligodendroglial tumors and glioblastomas. Testing for those molecular genetic alterations would be essential to obtain more homogeneous sets of gliomas for the future clinical studies",

    "Title": "Modulation of biologic endpoints by topical difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), in subjects at high-risk for nonmelanoma skin cancer",
    "Abstract": "More than one million new skin cancers are diagnosed yearly in the United States creating the need for effective primary and chemopreventive strategies to reduce the incidence, morbidity, and mortality associated with skin cancer. Skin chemoprevention trials often focus on subjects at high risk of nonmelanoma skin cancers and include biological endpoints like number of actinic keratoses (AK) and measures of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and p53 expression and/or mutation. Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, suppresses increased polyamine synthesis and inhibits tumors in models of skin carcinogenesis. Thus, DFMO is a good candidate chemopreventive agent in humans at increased risk of NMSC. We reported previously results of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of topical DFMO in 48 participants with AK. In this study there was a significant reduction in the number of AK (23.5%; P = 0.001) and the polyamine, spermidine (26%, P = 0.04; Alberts, D. S. et al. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev., 9: 1281-2186, 2000). In skin biopsies from the same study, we demonstrate that topical DFMO significantly reduces the percentage of p53-positive cells (22%; P = 0.04); however, there were no significant changes in proliferating cell nuclear antigen or apoptotic indices, or in the frequency of p53 mutations (25% at baseline, 21% after placebo, and 26% after DFMO). We conclude that inhibition of the premalignant AK lesions as well as a reduction in the expression of p53 and in spermidine concentrations may serve as surrogate endpoint biomarkers of DFMO and possibly other topically administered skin cancer chemopreventive agents",

    "Abstract": "This study was designed to define the potential clinical relevance of identifying alterations affecting p53 pathway in bladder cancer and to test a new, low-cost, high-throughput, and array-based TP53 sequencing technology. Tumor samples from 140 evaluable patients with bladder cancer were analyzed with two methods to detect TP53 gene mutations, including single-stranded conformational polymorphism followed by direct sequencing and an oligonucleotide array-based sequencing method. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess patterns of expression of p53, p21/WAF1, and mdm2. Median follow-up time was 27.6 months. Results from the above analyses were correlated with clinicopathological parameters and outcome. Combining the mutation-detection assays, 79 cases (56.4%) were found to harbor TP53 gene mutations. Direct sequencing identified 66 point mutations and five frameshift mutations. The p53 oligonucleotide array detected 65 point mutations and four splice site mutations in different exons but missed all five frameshift mutations. p53 nuclear overexpression was observed in 71 cases (50.7%), lack of p21 nuclear expression was found in 81 cases (57.9%), and mdm2 nuclear overexpression was seen in 64 cases (45.7%). In multivariate analysis, 17 patients (12.1%) had an altered p53 pathway, defined by the detection of mutant TP53 and/or p53 nuclear overexpression, loss of p21 nuclear expression, and mdm2 nuclear overexpression, and exhibited the worst clinical outcome in the observation period (P = 0.015), and it appears to be a significant prognostic factor associated with patient survival",

    "Title": "The early growth response gene EGR-1 behaves as a suppressor gene that is down-regulated independent of ARF/Mdm2 but not p53 alterations in fresh human gliomas",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: EGR-1 is an immediate early gene with diverse functions that include the suppression of growth. EGR-1 is down-regulated many cancer cell types, suggesting a tumor suppressor role, and may critically involve the p53 pathway. The aim of this work was to measure the expression of EGR-1 and the p16/INK4a/ARF-Mdm2-p53 pathway status in fresh human gliomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty-one human gliomas with different grades of malignancy were investigated for Egr-1 mRNA and the protein expression, frequency, and spectrum of p53 gene mutations, mdm2 gene amplification, and p16/INK4a/ARF allele loss. RESULTS: The amplification of Mdm2 and the deletion of the p16/INK4a gene was found in 3 and 5 cases, respectively, whereas mutations of p53, including two novel mutations, were observed in 10 other cases. The three types of changes occurred strictly mutually exclusively, emphasizing that these genes operate in a common pathway critical to glioma progression. EGR-1 mRNA was significantly down-regulated in astrocytomas (14.7 +/- 5.1%) and in glioblastomas (33.6 +/- 10.0%) versus normal brain. Overall, EGR- 1 mRNA was strongly suppressed (average, 15.2 +/- 13.9%) in 27 of 31 cases (87%), independent of changes in p16/INK4a/ARF and Mdm2; whereas 4 of 31 cases with residual EGR-1 expression as well as the highest EGR- 1 variance segregated with p53 mutations. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the suppression of EGR-1 protein. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that EGR-1 is commonly suppressed in gliomas independent of p16/INK4a/ARF and Mdm2 and that suppression is less crucial in tumors bearing p53 mutations, and these results implicate an EGR-1 growth regulatory mechanism as a target of inactivation during tumor progression",

    "Title": "p53 Mutation Arising in Arg72 Allele in the Tumorigenesis and Development of Carcinoma of the Urinary Tract",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: It is known that a common p53 polymorphism, encodingeither proline (Pro) or arginine (Arg) at residue 72, produces marked change in the structure of p53. Furthermore, the Arg72-containing allele is preferentially mutated and retained in various human tumors, suggesting that polymorphic residue within p53 modifies mutant behavior. We studied to determine whether Arg72 could be a risk factor for p53 mutations in human transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs). In addition, the relationship between the status of p53 codon 72 polymorphism and clinicopathological factors of this tumor were also analyzed. Experimental Design: We analyzed the correlation between the p53 mutations and genotypes of its codon 72 using genomic DNAs from the TCCs by direct DNA sequencing. Loss of heterozygosity was determined using a p53 microsatellite marker (TP53) amplified by PCR. RESULTS: There was a bias to mutate and express the Arg allele in the p53 - mutated TCCs arising in individuals with heterozygosity (Pro/Arg). The Arg72-containing allele was preferentially retained in these tumors. The prevalence of cases with p53 mutations within Arg72-containing allele was higher for advanced-stage TCCs (chi(2) = 5.320, P = 0.021) than for TCCs with those arising in Pro72-containing allele. CONCLUSIONS: Our in vivo findings suggested that p53 mutation alleles containing Arg72 are preferentially selected during tumorigenesis and affect mutant behavior in TCCs, and revealed that TCCs with p53 mutation arising in Arg72-containing allele became progressively more abundant with increase in tumor stage",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze retrospectivelytiming, frequency, and prognostic impact of TP53 mutations and P53 protein accumulation in supratentorial WHO grade II astrocytomas and oligoastrocytomas of adult patients. Experimental Design: We included 159 consecutively treated patients (1991-1998), and each tumor was screened for TP53 mutations and P53 protein overexpression. Prognostic evaluation was performed with the multivariate proportional hazards model. RESULTS: TP53 mutations (P53 protein overexpression) were detected in 49% (47%) of all tumors with a preference for the gemistocytic subtype (P < 0.05). The TP53 status of the primary tumor was predictive for the status of the recurrent tumor, and tumor recurrence/progression was associated with an increase of P53 immunopositive cells in 68% of the investigated tumors. Univariately, gemistocytic subtype and presence of TP53 mutation (but not P53 accumulation) were unfavorable predictors for progression-free survival (P < 0.05); multivariately, only the gemistocytic subtype remained unfavorable influence (P = 0.04). No overall prognostic impact of the TP53 status on survival and time to malignancy was observed (P < 0.05). Five nongemistocytic tumors with a codon 175 TP53 mutation exhibited a significantly worse prognosis as compared with those with any other mutational sites (5-year progression-free survival: 0%; 5-year malignant transformation: 100%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: TP53 mutations are frequent and early events in the pathogenesis of WHO grade II astrocytomas/oligoastrocytomas, and most of the univariately detected overall prognostic impact of the TP53 status must be related to the influence of the gemistocytic subtype. In nongemistocytic astrocytomas, a hot spot codon 175 TP53 mutation indicates a worse prognosis in terms of time to progression and malignancy",

    "Title": "Usefulness of p53 gene mutations in the supernatant of bile for diagnosis of biliary tract carcinoma: comparison with K- ras mutation",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The sensitivity of bile cytology for the diagnosis of biliary tract carcinoma (BTCa) is still low. In addition, the incidence of detection of genetic mutations in the bile of BTCa is not satisfactory yet. To improve the molecular diagnosis of BTCa, we analyzed p53 and K- ras mutations in DNA extracted from not only the sediment but the supernatant of bile samples. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing were used for analyses of p53 mutations in exons 5 through 8. K- ras mutations at codon 12 were examined by mutant allele-specific amplification. RESULTS: In bile supernatant from patients with BTCa, p53 and K- ras mutations were detected in 50.0% (15/30) and 56.7% (17/30) of cases, respectively. The incidence of p53and K- ras mutations in the sediment was 33.3% and 43.3%, respectively. When a combination assay with both genes was used, molecular abnormalities were detected in 80.0% of cases, including 3 in which p53 alone was positive. In addition, either p53 or K- rasmutations were detected in 12 of 15 (80.0%) cases of BTCa in which the cytologic diagnoses were negative. p53 mutations were detected in neither supernatant nor sediment in 20 patients with cholelithiasis, although the incidence of K- ras mutations in the sediment was 20%. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of p53 and K- ras mutations is higher in the supernatant than in the sediment, and simultaneous analyses of p53 and K- ras in the two bile fractions could enhance the genetic diagnosis of BTCa. Notably, the specificity of p53 mutations for cancer was very high in bile samples, and the sensitivity was also relatively high",

    "Title": "Malignant transformation of renal angiomyolipoma: a case report",
    "Abstract": "We report a case of renal angiomyolipoma (AML) with malignant transformation. A 28-year-old woman developed large bilateral renal masses 5 months before admission to our hospital. She was diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis when she was 4 years old. Total nephrectomy of the left kidney was performed, but she died during the operation. Although the focal region of the resected tumor had the appearance of a classic AML, most of the lesion showed a diffuse proliferation of atypical epithelioid cells resembling that in renal cell carcinoma. The epithelioid cells had extremely pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei with frequent mitotic figures, including atypical forms. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the atypical epithelioid cells and the typical AML lesions were both positive for HMB-45 but that the former were negative for epithelial and myogenic markers. The smooth muscle cells and thick-walled vessels were focally positive for muscle-specific actins. Furthermore, the atypical epithelioid cells were immunoreactive for p53, whereas the foci of the typical AML were negative. Examination of the microdissected paraffin-embedded tissues revealed p53 mutations in the malignant epithelioid areas in AML but not in the renal parenchyma or typical AML areas. In this case it is proposed that p53 mutation may play an important role in malignant transformation of renal AML",

    "Abstract": "A pleomorphic undifferentiated tumor primarily located in the retroperitoneum with a phenotype compatible with an extraosseous Ewing tumor/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ET/pPNET) pattern and unusual molecular features is described. Immunohistochemically, HBA-71 (CD99/mic2) and several neural markers were intensively expressed together with scattered cells expressing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Short-term culture showed biphasic neuroblastic and epithelioid cell populations, with the latter expressing germ cell markers (CEA, alpha-fetoprotein, and the beta-subunit of chorionic gonadotrophin). Conventional cytogenetics displayed several chromosomic rearrangements, especially a complex translocation t(17,2,22,13) (q21::q11-->q33::q12-- >q13::q14). These structural abnormalities were confirmed using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Molecular studies revealed EWS-FEV fusion transcripts (exon 7 of the EWS gene and exon 2 of the FEV gene). In addition, a new p53 mutation not previously reported in ET/pPNET involving exon 5 codon 138: GCC to GAC (Ala/Asp) was detected.In our case, we emphasize the presence of atypical features not only from the phenotypic point of view but also at the genetic level as well as the value of detecting such markers in the differential diagnosis with other abdominal pleomorphic tumors",

The difference between p53 mutations observed in type I and type III intestinal metaplasia was not statistically significant. No identical mutation of the p53 gene was found in the intestinal metaplasia and carcinoma specimens from the patients. There was no case of intestinal metaplasia showing MSI. In gastric carcinomas, MSI was observed in six cases (40%). The cases harboring BAT-26 instability did not have the mutation of the p53 gene. These data suggest that intestinal metaplasia adjacent to gastric carcinoma, irrespective of its subtype, do not have the genetic alterations as showing in their carcinoma tissues",

    "Abstract": "The degree of correlation between sequencing and immunohistochemisty (IHC) for detecting mutations of p53 has not been well established in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We analyzed 36 HCCs from Korean people for p53 mutation at exons 4-10 by PCR-SSCP and sequencing, and compared the results with the IHC positivity. p53 mutations were identified in 7 out of 36 HCCs (19.4%). These mutations were found widely throughout exons 4-8. No mutation was detected in codon 249. Among the 7 mutations, 6 missense mutations were detected in 15 HCCs with >/=5% immunoreactive tumor cells and one nonsense mutation was in 21 HCCs with <5% immunoreactive tumor cells. The sensitivity for p53 mutation was 85.7% (6/7), the specificity 69.0% (20/29), the predictive value of positive IHC 40.0% (6/15), and the predictive value of negative IHC 95.2% (20/21). Two missense mutations were detected in 25 cases with <10% immunoreactive tumor cells. Predictive values of both positive IHC and negative IHC were higher in >/=5% overexpression group than in >/=10% overexpression group or >0% overexpression group. This study suggests that 5% immunoreactivity is a reliable immunohistochemical threshold value to detect p53 mutations in HCCs and the spectrum of p53 mutations in HCCs in Korean people is different from that of high aflatoxin B1 exposure areas",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To characterize molecular mutations of p53 gene in Thai ovarian cancer and compare the mutations with their pathological and clinical findings. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Direct DNA sequencing of hot spot region of p53 gene (exons 5 to 8) from 28 primary ovarian cancer tissues, 2 metastatic tumors and their paired blood samples was performed. The detected mutations were compared to the pathological and clinical findings and responsiveness to treatments after 36 months of follow-up. RESULTS: One insertion and 4 point mutations in exon 5 of p53 gene were found in 5 out of 28 (18%) ovarian cancer patients. There was no mutation in the paired blood samples. The histological types of the detected tumors were 3 endometrioids and 2 serous cystadenocarcinomas. All 5 patients were in stage I to IV disease and showed overall 4 out of 5 (80%) complete response until 36 months after surgery followed by chemotherapy, compared to 14 out of 28 (50%) of complete response in all cases of ovarian cancer. CONCLUSION: The authors found 5 cases of ovarian cancer patients with p53 gene mutations giving the same response to complete standard treatment as all cases. Significant factors affecting responsiveness of these patients depended more on stages, grades and histological cell types of the cancer",

    "Title": "Mutations of p53, c-kit, K-ras, and beta-catenin gene in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of adrenal gland",
    "Abstract": "Malignant lymphoma of the adrenal gland is a rare disease, usually with diffuse large cell morphology and B-cell immunophenotype, and often associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. In this study, mutations of p53, c-kit, K-ras, and beta-catenin gene were analyzed in 17 cases (13 males and four females with ages ranging from 25 to 84 years) of such lymphomas by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism followed by direct sequencing. Selected exons in each gene, representing hot spots, were analyzed. All 44 mutations detected were single-nucleotide substitutions and 33 were missense mutations. Nineteen mutations were detected in exon 5 and / or 7 of the p53 gene in nine of 17 cases (52.9%) and 21 in exon 11 and / or 17 of the c-kit gene in 10 of 14 cases (71.4%). Bilateral adrenal lesions in one case who had not received any adjuvant therapy showed different mutational patterns of the p53 and c-kit genes, suggesting different clonal evolution of lymphoma between the left and right sides. Mutation at codon 13 of the K-ras gene was detected in one of 14 cases (7.1%), and in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene in three of 12 cases (25%). All but one mutation were transition mutations, indicating that some endogenous mutagens act in lymphomagenesis in the adrenal gland. Our results suggest that p53 and c-kit gene mutations might play a role in adrenal lymphomagenesis",

    "Title": "Increased frequency of p53 mutation in sporadic colorectal cancer from cigarette smokers",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking has been shown to increase the risk of colorectal cancer. However, the relation between smoking and genetic alterations has not been clarified in this type of cancer. METHODS: Mutations of p53, APC, beta-catenin and K-ras-2 genes were analyzed in colorectal carcinomas from 28 smokers and 33 non-smokers. Frequencies and types of mutations were compared between smokers and non-smokers. RESULTS: The frequency of carcinomas with p53 mutation was higher in smokers (20/28, 71%) than in non-smokers (15/33, 45%) (P = 0.037). The common type of mutation was single-base substitution including G:C to A:T transition in both groups (68% in smokers and 67% in non-smokers). With respect to G:C to A:T transitions, mutation at CpG sites was less frequent in smokers (9/15, 60%) than in non-smokers (10/10, 100%), whereas mutation at non-CpG sites was more frequent in smokers (6/16, 40%) than in non-smokers (0/10, 0%) (P = 0.028). The frequency of APC mutation was not significantly different between smokers (14/28, 50%) and non-smokers (15/33, 45%). No beta-catenin mutation was detected in carcinomas from smokers. K-ras-2 mutation occurred in smokers at a similar frequency (9/28, 32%) to that in non-smokers (13/33, 39%). Concerning pathological aspects, Dukes' A carcinomas were less frequent in smokers (11%) than in non-smokers (33%), whereas Dukes' D carcinomas were more frequent in smokers (25%) than in non-smokers (15%). CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that an increased frequency of p53 gene mutation, including G:C to A:T transitions at non-CpG sites, is associated with an increased risk of colorectal carcinogenesis in cigarette smokers",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite an increasing number of patients suffering from squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the origin and development of these neoplasms. METHODS: We screened microdissected tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSC) specimens from 28 consecutive, previously untreated, Japanese patients for mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (exons 5, 6, 7, 8) and direct genomic sequencing. RESULTS: Among them, 24 tumor specimens were well differentiated, three moderately and one poorly differentiated, according to the WHO classification. Mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene were detected in only two out of the 28 (7%) tumor specimens. One was well differentiated and the other was poorly differentiated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that p53 gene mutations are less frequent in well differentiated TSC. These results indicate that mutations in the p53 gene may not be strongly involved in the development of well differentiated TSC",

    "Title": "Overexpression of wild-type p53 in lichen sclerosus adjacent to human papillomavirus-negative vulvar cancer",
    "Abstract": "Human papillomavirus is a risk factor for vulvar cancer, whereas human papillomavirus-negative late onset vulvar carcinoma is associated with the dermatologic condition, lichen sclerosus. Human papillomavirus E6 protein targets TP53 for degradation and by inference it has been assumed that human papillomavirus-negative vulvar cancer is dependent upon the acquisition of p53 somatic mutations and subsequent allelic loss. To investigate this, TP53 expression, loss of heterozygosity, and p53 genomic sequence were examined in 29 cases of human papillomavirus-negative vulvar carcinoma with adjacent lichen sclerosus. We examined 37 cases of lichen sclerosus without vulvar carcinoma, 10 cases of nongenital lichen sclerosus, and 12 cases of normal vulvar epithelium served as controls. TP53 was evident in 72% of vulvar carcinoma, 48% in epithelium adjacent to vulvar carcinoma, but was minimal in normal samples. When lichen sclerosus cases were selected to exclude samples with absolutely no TP53 expression through probable failed antigen retrieval or homozygous p53 loss the number of epithelial cells expressing TP53 increased progressively from nongenital lichen sclerosus to lichen sclerosus without vulvar carcinoma, then to lichen sclerosus with vulvar carcinoma (p<0.0001). These data suggest elevated TP53 is a feature of vulvar lichen sclerosus. Seventy-four percent of vulvar carcinoma had chromosome 17p-linked loss of heterozygosity, whereas 47% of adjacent lichen sclerosus featured loss of heterozygosity, but only 31% of vulvar carcinoma had p53 mutations, a frequency less than reported previously. Seven percent of adjacent lichen sclerosus had mutations, showing for the first time the presence of an identical mutation to the matched vulvar carcinoma. These data, however, implicate p53 mutations as a later event in vulvar carcinoma and in marked contrast to the original expectation, our loss of heterozygosity data are consistent with loss of another locus (not p53) on 17p operating as a tumor suppressor in lichen sclerosus destined to develop vulvar carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most frequent manifestation of cutaneous T cell lymphoma but its cause and pathophysiology remain unclear. Because progression of lesions is characteristically slow, we hypothesized that mycosis fungoides originates from an accumulation of lymphocytes due to defective apoptosis of skin homing T lymphocytes. In this study, we investigate possible alterations of three molecules regulating apoptosis, i.e., Fas antigen, Bax, and p53, at the genomic level in skin lesions from 44 patients with MF, as Fas mediates one of two major pathways for apoptosis of activated T cells. Fas mutations were found in six patients using a polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformational polymorphism method followed by cloning and sequencing of abnormal polymerase chain reaction products. The mutations predict for defective transmission of the death signal in three cases. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the lack of Fas protein expression on dermal lymphocytes in one case with Fas gene mutation predicting for a truncated death domain, whereas Fas protein was expressed by dermal lymphocytes in the other investigated cases. By contrast, no mutations of Bax or p53 were found, whereas immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased p53 expression in the nucleus of basal keratinocytes above the neoplastic infiltrate in some MF cases. These results support the hypothesis that Fas defects may play a role in the pathogenesis of MF",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mutations in TP53 have been observed in a variety of tumors including oral lesions, though there are no reports in ameloblastomas. The purpose of the study was to examine the TP53 status of ameloblastomas using newly developed yeast functional assay whose accuracy and sensitivity has been proven to be higher than those of the previous DNA structure-based methods such as single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. METHODS: TP53 status was analyzed by yeast functional assay and DNA sequencing in 12 cases of ameloblastoma which were diagnosed histologically and represented the clinical features of a benign tumor. After the extraction of RNA from the frozen tissue samples without microdissection, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was carried out and these samples were used. The assay can detect mutations of p53 mRNA between codons 67 and 347 by the DNA-binding activity of the protein and reveal them as red colonies. RESULTS: One case of 47-year-old male gave 17% red colonies of yeast and the other 11 cases gave 5.4% (mean; range, 3-8%). To confirm this result, we obtained other nine samples from the case of 17% red colonies, which contained or did not contain tumor tissues, and analyzed them by the assay. Seven samples that were histologically negative for tumor cells gave 4.7% red colonies (mean; range, 1-7%). Two samples that were histologically positive for tumor cells gave 20 or 46% of red colonies. The p53 plasmids were recovered from the red colonies of these three samples showing high red colony ratios and were subjected to sequencing analysis after purification. In all these samples, the same clonal mutation of TGT (Cys) 238 TAT (Tyr) was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that TP53 mutation may be involved in molecular pathogenesis in a subset of ameloblastomas, though it is infrequent",

    "Title": "A novel p53 mutant retained functional activity in lung carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "The gene p53 is a critical tumor suppressor that can respond to multiple signals of cellular gatekeepers for growth and division. The mdm2 gene is one of the downstream target genes for transcriptional activation by the product of p53 tumor suppressor gene. Transactivation of mdm2 gene is represented by the presence of a functional P53 protein. To understand the biological function of mutant p53 in tumorigenesis, we constructed a number of p53 mutants by site-directed mutagenesis (H179Y, L194R, S240R, R249S, A276D, E286Q), followed by characterization of each P53 mutant's ability to transactivate mdm2, bax and p21waf. The transactivation properties of p53 mutants were compared by co-transfection with pGL-3-mdm2, pGL-3-bax and pGL-3-p21waf into the P53 null cell line H1299 derived from a non-small cell lung carcinoma. Among them mt p53 S240R and E286Q were shown to have enhanced transactivating activity of pGL3-mdm2, at about 43.2 and 28.2% of the wt p53 vector, respectively, while the remaining four had nearly the same level of activity as the negative control did. Furthermore, data indicated that mt p53 S240R had as high an ability to suppress the growth of the p53 null cell line H1299 as wild type p53. Therefore, mutant p53 alone is an insufficient indicator of poor prognosis. Instead, functional p53 may affect lung cancer prognosis",

    "Title": "Allelic imbalances in human bladder cancer: genome-wide detection with high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer is characterized by genomic instability. In this study, we investigated whether genome-wide screening using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays could detect allelic imbalance (loss or gain of at least one allele) in bladder cancers. METHODS: For microarray analysis, DNA was isolated from microdissected bladder tumors and leukocytes from 11 patients. The stage T1 tumor (connective tissue invasive) and the subsequent stage T2-4 tumor (muscle invasive) were available from eight of these patients, and only the first muscle-invasive stage T2-4 tumor was available from three of the 11 patients. The microarray contained 1494 biallelic polymorphic sequences. For microsatellite analyses, DNA was isolated from tumors and leukocytes of nine patients with primary T2-4 tumors and 13 patients with Ta (noninvasive) tumors. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We assigned a genotype to 1204 loci, 343 of which were heterozygous. Allelic imbalance was detected in known areas of imbalance on chromosomes 6, 8, 9, 11, and 17, and a new area of imbalance was detected on the p arm of chromosome 6. Microsatellite analysis of nine other T2-4 tumors and 13 Ta tumors showed that allelic imbalance was more frequent in T2-4 tumors than in Ta tumors (P<.001). We detected 8.5 allelic imbalances (median) in 348 informative loci in T1 tumors and 28 allelic imbalances (median) in 329 informative loci in T2-4 tumors. When pairs of T1 and T2-4 tumors were analyzed from eight patients, 68% of imbalances detected in T1 tumors (146 imbalances) occurred in the subsequent T2-4 tumors (99 imbalances). Homozygous TP53 mutations were more often associated (P =.005) with high allelic imbalance than with low allelic imbalance. CONCLUSION: SNP arrays are feasible for high-throughput, genome-wide scanning for allelic imbalances in bladder cancer",

    "Title": "TP53 protein expression analysis by luminometric immunoassay in comparison with gene mutation status and prognostic factors in early stage endometrial cancer",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene have been shown to significantly correlate with poor prognosis in endometrial cancer. In the present study we have evaluated a luminometric immunoassay (LIA) for quantitative estimation of TP53 protein expression in 65 cytosol preparations from endometrial cancer, previously analyzed for mutations in TP53 exons 4-10. LIA showed high (> or = 0.6 ng/mg protein) expression of TP53 protein in all eight tumors with missense mutation, but high protein levels were also detected in 15 tumors with normal TP53 sequence. All four tumors with nonsense or frameshift mutations had low or no TP53 protein expression. LIA was further evaluated in a retrospective study of 201 cytosol samples from endometrial cancer. TP53 overexpression (> = 0.6 ng/mg protein) was observed in 22% of the tumors and correlated with nonendometrioid histology types (P = 0.005), poorly differentiated tumors (P = 0.001), higher FIGO grade (P = 0.001), DNA nondiploidy (P = 0.002), and high S-phase fraction (P = 0.03). After a median follow-up time of 6.8 years (range 0.7-9.9 years), 22 (13%) progressions were observed in the 175 patients with early stage (I-II) disease. TP53 overexpression (P = 0.04), FIGO grade 3 vs. 1 + 2 (P = 0.01), higher age (P = 0.02), and DNA nondiploidy (P < 0.001) showed significant correlation to shorter progression-free survival in these patients. We conclude that TP53 protein analysis by LIA provides an incomplete correlation to mutation status and cannot substitute for mutation analysis in assessment of prognosis in endometrial carcinoma. In comparison to TP53 overexpression and higher FIGO grades, DNA nonploidy status seems to be a better prognostic indicator to define a subset of early stage endometrial cancer patients who may benefit by adjuvant chemotherapy/radiotherapy",

    "Title": "Splicing mutations in TP53 in human squamous cell carcinoma lines influence immunohistochemical detection",
    "Abstract": "The mutational status of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 is often examined by immunohistochemistry. We compared the incidence of TP53 mutations in 12 permanent squamous cell carcinoma lines of the head and neck with the immunohistochemical staining obtained with two different antibodies. The mutational status of the TP53 gene was assessed by sequencing the complete coding frame of the TP53 mRNA. All 12 tumor cell lines had TP53 mutations. Six of them showed missense mutations and five had premature stop codons caused either by splicing mutations or nonsense mutations or by exon skipping. One tumor cell line was heterozygous, with a truncating splicing mutation and an additional missense mutation located on different alleles. In one case, an in-frame insertion of 23 extra codons was found. All missense mutations were positive in immunhistochemistry and Western blotting. The truncated p53 was not immunohistochemically detected in three cases with the DO-7 antibody and in five cases with the G59-12 antibody, giving false-negative results in 25% or 40%, respectively, of all tumor cell lines examined. We conclude that splicing mutations are common in squamous cell carcinoma lines and that the incidence of p53 inactiviation by erroneous splicing is higher than yet reported. Sequencing of only the exons of TP53 may miss intronic mutations leading to missplicing and may therefore systematically underestimate the TP53 mutation frequency",

    "Title": "P53 gene mutations in pleuropulmonary blastomas",
    "Abstract": "Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is rare childhood tumor oniginating from either lung or pleura. Although several cytogenetic changes, such as tisomy 2, trisomy 8, and loss of 17p material, have been reported, evidence of gene mutations is still lacking. Pathologically, PPB shares similarities with rhabdomyosarcoma in which p53 mutations arefrequently detected. Possible implication of p53 mutations in PPB was investigated. PPBs of 3 patients were analyzed for occurrence of p53 mutations by using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method, and the nature of mutations was confirmed by direct sequencing. Two PPBs were confirmed to harbor p53 mutations. One was a Val to Leu substitution at codon 173, and another was a ArgArg to TrpCys substitution at codons 282 and 283. In each tumor, only the mutated allele was detected, suggesting inactivation of p53. Both patients with mutations had fatal outcome, while the remaining patient in whom no mutation was detected is disease free for 3 years after completion of treatment. The results raise the possibility that p53 inactivation can occur as a nonrandom genetic change involving the pathogenesis and outcome of PPB. Further studies in a larger series are necessary to clarify these matters",

    "Title": "Establishment of a large cell lung cancer cell line (Y-ML-1B) producing granulocyte colony-stimulating factor",
    "Abstract": "We established a new lung cancer cell line, designated Y-ML-1B, from a lung cancer of a 70-year-old Japanese man with leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. Before surgical resection, the white blood cell and platelet counts were elevated to 34,400/mm3 and 668,000/mm3, respectively, and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) level in the serum was increased at 141 pg/mL. The primary tumor showed an undifferentiated morphology with large cells and induced extensive thickening of the pleura in the right hemithorax. The Y-ML-1B cells grow as a monolayer, with a doubling time of 19 hours, and are tumorigenic in nude mice, which showed a morphology similar to the primary tumor in xenografts. Analysis of the supernatant of cell culture medium of Y-ML-1B showed elevated levels of G-CSF and other cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), consistent with the high levels detected in the patient's serum. Cytogenetic analysis revealed aneuploidy of greater than 56 in metaphases with many structural abnormalities. Mutation analysis of the tumor suppressor genes showed that Y-ML-1B is inactivated in TP53 and RASSF1A, but not in p14(ARF), p16(INK4A), or RB. Neither activating mutations of KRAS or NRAS nor amplification of MYC or MDM2 were detected. Y-ML-1B expressed N-cadherin but not E-cadherin. This newly established cell line might serve as a useful model for studying the molecular pathogenesis for large cell cancers of the lung which express high levels of cytokines",

    "Title": "Discordance of genetic alterations between primary head and neck tumors and corresponding metastases associated with mutational status of the TP53 gene",
    "Abstract": "Ample molecular data are available on the progression from normal mucosa to invasive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but information on further genetic progression to metastatic disease is scarce. To obtain insight into the metastatic process, we compared 23 primary HNSCCs with 25 corresponding lymph node metastases (LNMs) and 10 corresponding distant metastases (DMs) with respect to TP53 mutations and patterns of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) based on 26 microsatellite markers on six chromosome arms (3p, 9p, 17p, 13q, 8p, and 18q). In 18 of the 23 patients, a TP53 mutation was detected in the primary tumor, and in all cases the same TP53 mutation was present in the corresponding LNM or DM. In nine of 20 patients with LNMs and three of seven patients with DMs, the LOH pattern of metastasis differed from that of the corresponding primary tumor by at least one marker. Microsatellite markers located on chromosome arms 13q, 8p, and 18q were most frequently discordant, providing evidence that alterations at these chromosomes occur late in HNSCC carcinogenesis. Moreover, evidence was found that DMs had developed directly from the primary tumor and not from LNMs. Remarkably, we observed that the mutational status of the TP53 gene is associated significantly with the degree of genetic differences between primary HNSCCs and corresponding metastases. All patients with TP53 wild-type primary tumors showed significantly more discordant LOH patterns in the corresponding LNMs and DMs than patients with TP53-mutated tumors. The percentages were 100% versus 27% (LNMs) and 100% versus 0% (DMs), respectively (P = 0.008 and P = 0.029; two-sided Fisher exact test). This finding suggests that TP53-mutated tumors need fewer additional genetic alterations to develop metastases compared with TP53 wild-type primary tumors",

    "Title": "Unusual case of leukemic mantle cell lymphoma with amplified CCND1/IGH fusion gene",
    "Abstract": "We describe a case of leukemic mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) with complex karyotype and amplification of the CCND1/IGH fusion gene. Testing for the presence of t(11;14), the hallmark of MCL, revealed multiple copies of the fusion signals. We therefore conducted extensive molecular cytogenetic studies to delineate the nature and consequences of such an abnormality. We localized the amplification to the der(14)t(11;14) and to a der(2) chromosome in a form of interspersed chromosome 11 and 14 material. This resulted in high expression of cyclin D1 mRNA and the protein expressed independently of the cell cycle phase. CGH analysis revealed that the overrepresentation on chromosome 11 included chromosomal band 11q23 in addition to the CCND1 locus at 11q13. The band 11q23 harbors the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene recently proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of MCL with high incidence of deletions in this locus. Using YAC 801e11, containing the ATM gene, we demonstrated several hybridization signals, suggesting that this region also formed part of the amplicon. This case also showed TP53 gene abnormalities: protein expression, monoallelic deletion, and a mutation in exon 5. The clinical course was aggressive, and the patient died within 6 months of presentation. This is to our knowledge the first description of amplification of the CCND1/IGH fusion gene in a human neoplasm, which may have played a role in the fulminating course of the disease in this patient",

    "Title": "High sensitivity of detection of TP53 somatic mutations by fluorescence- assisted mismatch analysis",
    "Abstract": "We analyzed exons 5-9 of the TP53 gene in 41 breast cancers using direct sequencing, PCR-SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism), and fluorescence-assisted mismatch analysis (FAMA), to test the level of specificity and sensitivity of each method. A major issue for the correct detection of TP53 somatic mutations in primary tumors is often represented by the large amount of normal DNA, which can cause excessive dilution of the mutant allele, with consequent possible false-negative results. High sensitivity upon dilution of the mutant allele has been demonstrated for FAMA, a method based on the chemical cleavage of a mismatch within heteroduplex DNA molecules. Exons 5-9 of the TP53 gene were analyzed by FAMA using only two long bifluorescent fragments. Differences in sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity were observed among the above-mentioned procedures. Thirteen of the 41 samples (31.7%) revealed TP53 genetic alterations by automated sequencing, 19 samples (46.3%) were positive for SSCP, whereas 14 samples (34%) showed variants detectable by FAMA. Seven samples were positive in SSCP, but negative in both FAMA and sequencing assays; however, 2 SSCP-negative samples revealed evident signals by FAMA, indicating the presence of TP53 mutations. One of the latter samples showed the alteration by sequence analysis, whereas the other failed to reveal the mutation signal even by sequencing, as a consequence of the very small amount of the mutant allele resulting from the excess of contaminating normal DNA. Our results show that FAMA may represent a suitable and accurate assay for the routine diagnosis of TP53 somatic mutations in DNAs from solid tumor biopsies",

    "Title": "Impact of genotype and morphology on the prognosis of glioblastoma",
    "Abstract": "The recognition of molecular subsets among glioblastomas has raised the question whether distinct mutations in glioblastoma-associated genes may serve as prognostic markers. The present study on glioblastomas (GBM) from 97 consecutively sampled adult patients is based on a clinical, histopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic analysis. Parameters assessed were age at diagnosis, survival, cell type, proliferation, necrosis, microvascular proliferation, sarcomatous growth, lymphocytic infiltration, thromboses, calcifications, GFAP expression, MIB-1 index, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the chromosomal arms 1p, 10p, 10q, 17p, 19q and structural alterations in the TP53, EGFR and PTEN genes. As in previous studies, younger age was significantly associated with better survival. Among the molecular parameters, TP53 mutations and LOH10q emerged as favorable and poor prognostic factors, respectively. TP53 mutations were a favorable prognostic factor independent of whether glioblastomas were primary or secondary. LOH1p or 19q, lesions suspected to be over-represented in long term survivors with malignant glioma, were not associated with better survival. However, the combination of LOH1p and LOH19q defined GBM patients with a significantly better survival. Notably, these patients did not exhibit morphological features reminiscent of oligodendroglioma. These findings indicate that genotyping of glioblastoma may provide clinical information of prognostic importance",

    "Title": "Genetic aberrations in gliomatosis cerebri support monoclonal tumorigenesis",
    "Abstract": "Gliomatosis cerebri is a rare condition in which the brain is infiltrated by an exceptionally diffusely growing glial cell population involving at least 2 lobes, though often more extensive, sometimes even affecting infratentorial regions. The neoplastic proliferation may have a monoclonal origin, or alternatively, reflect progressive neoplastic change of an entire tissue field ('field cancerization'). The presence of an identical set of genetic aberrations throughout the lesion would point to monoclonality of the proliferation. In contrast, the finding of non-identical genetic changes in widely separated regions within the neoplasm would support the concept of field cancerization. In the present study, a unique autopsy case of gliomatosis was available to verify either one of these hypotheses. Tissue samples were randomly taken from 24 locations throughout the brain and used for genetic investigation. In all samples the histology showed an identical picture of slightly elongated astrocytic cells, typical for gliomatosis. TP53 exon 5-8 mutation analysis was performed on all samples. Genome-wide screening for chromosomal aberrations was accomplished by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). In addition, loss of heterozygosity analysis for polymorphic markers on chromosomal regions of the 2 most frequently observed DNA deletions was carried out. The most widespread genetic aberration was mutation of exon 7 of TP53, which was detected in 20 of 24 samples. Bidirectional sequencing revealed a mutation in codon 234 (TAC234TGC), resulting in an amino acid substitution Tyr-Cys. CGH analysis revealed losses on 2q11-q31 in 13 of 24 samples and losses on 19q13-qter in 10 of 24 samples from both left and right hemispheres. Allelic imbalances for markers on 2q (2q14.3 and 2q22.1) and 19q (both 19q13.2) were demonstrated in 10 of 24 and 18 of 24 samples, respectively. Other widespread chromosomal aberrations included losses on 3q13-qter and 16q22-qter and gains on 7q22-qter. The wide distribution of a particular set of genetic aberrations in this case supports the concept of monoclonal tumor proliferation. The results point to involvement of TP53 mutation in the tumorigenesis of gliomatosis cerebri",

    "Title": "Genetic alterations commonly found in diffusely infiltrating cerebral gliomas are rare or absent in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas",
    "Abstract": "Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is a rare, usually well-circumscribed and superficially located neoplasm that preferentially arises in the cerebral cortex of children and young adults. The molecular aberrations that are associated with these tumors have not been studied systematically so far. We here report on a molecular genetic analysis of 62 PXAs (46 PXAs of World Health Organization [WHO] grade II and 16 PXAs with anaplastic features) for alterations of 5 candidate genes known to be frequently aberrant in diffusely infiltrating astrocytic gliomas, i.e. TP53, CDKN2A (p16(INK4a)), CDK4, MDM2, and EGFR. Only 3 PXAs (5%) carried a TP53 mutation. None of the 62 PXAs had lost both copies of the CDKN2A gene. The CDK4, MDM2, or EGFR genes were not amplified in any of the tumors. Fourteen PXAs were additionally analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at microsatellite markers located on the chromosomes/chromosomal arms 1, gp, 9p, 10, 17, 19q, and 22q. Two PXAs (14%) had LOH at all informative markers on 9p, while 1 PXA demonstrated an interstitial area of allelic imbalance between D22S533 and D22S417 at 22q11.2-q13.3. Further analysis of 10 PXAs for inactivation of the CDKN2A. p14(ARF), and CDKN2B (p15(INK4b)) genes on 9p21 did not reveal any homozygous deletion, mutation, promoter hypermethylation, or complete loss of mRNA expression. Taken together, our results indicate that the chromosomal and genetic aberrations in PXAs are different from those typically associated with the diffusely infiltrating astrocytic and oligodendroglial gliomas. These genetic differences likely contribute to the more favorable behavior of PXAs and may be helpful for the molecular differential diagnosis of cerebral gliomas",

    "Title": "Mutations in APC, Kirsten-ras, and p53--alternative genetic pathways to colorectal cancer",
    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer is one of the most significant causes of cancer death. A genetic model for colorectal cancer has been proposed in which the sequential accumulation of mutations in specific genes, including adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), Kirsten-ras (K-ras), and p53, drives the transition from healthy colonic epithelia through increasingly dysplastic adenoma to colorectal cancer. We have characterized tumor mutation spectra in a large cohort of colorectal cancer patients. In marked contrast to the predictions of the sequential model of mutation accumulation, only 6.6% of tumors were found to contain mutations in APC, K-ras, and p53, with 38.7% of tumors containing mutations in only one of these genes. The most common combination of mutations was p53 and APC (27.1%), whereas mutations in both p53 and K-ras were extremely rare. Statistical analysis (two-sided Fisher's exact test) confirmed that mutations in K-ras and p53 co-occurred less frequently than expected by chance (P < 0.01, Fisher's exact test). This finding suggests that these mutations lie on alternate pathways of colorectal tumor development. The heterogeneous pattern of tumor mutations in our patient cohort suggests that multiple alternative genetic pathways to colorectal cancer exist and that the widely accepted genetic model of cancer development is not representative of the majority of colorectal tumors",

    "Title": "Carcinogen-specific mutation pattern in the p53 tumour suppressor gene in UV radiation-induced basal cell carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is mainly caused by high and long-term UV radiation. UV radiation causes DNA damage in various genes. Mutations of the p53 tumour suppressor gene have been identified in a wide variety of human cancers. The aim of the study was to analyse specific p53 mutations in BCCs in workers exposed to high and long-term UV radiation. METHODS: The mutation pattern of the p53 tumour suppressor gene was analysed in tissue from 12 patients with UV-related BCC. All patients had a suspected occupational disease notified within the period 1995-1999. As a control, 20 BCC skin samples removed from areas definitively unexposed to sunlight were analysed. The specific mutations were determined by direct sequencing of codon 4 to 9 of the p53 gene in carcinomatous and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue after microdissection. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect p53 protein. RESULTS: p53 mutations were detected in 7/12 cases (58%). Point mutations were found in six cases (50%). In one case a deletion of 24 base pairs was observed. The most frequent mutations we found were CC-->TT base-pair changes in four and C-->T mutations in two cases. Within the control group specific p53 mutations were found in 11 cases (55%) without any C-->T predominance. No case showed CC-->TT mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations of the p53 tumour suppressor gene in UV-associated BCC are frequent events. A predominance of C-->T mutations and tandem CC-->TT base-pair changes were observed in the sunlight-exposed cases only supporting the idea of site-directed mutagenesis by UV radiation in human BCC",

    "Abstract": "An Arg/Pro polymorphism in codon 72 of the TP53 gene was analyzed in blood samples from 390 breast and 162 colorectal cancer patients previously investigated for TP53 mutations in their tumors. Among the breast cancer cases, 228 were homozygous for the Arg72 allele, of which, 65 (28.5%) also had a TP53 mutation in their tumors. In contrast, of 26 cases that were homozygous for the Pro72 allele, only 1 case (3.8%) had a TP53 mutation in the tumor (P = 0.004). Cloning the TP53 gene from tumor DNA followed by sequencing was performed in 14 heterozygotes with tumor mutation, and 9 of the mutations resided on the Arg72 allele. Among the colorectal cancer cases, no difference in mutation frequency was seen between the two different homozygotes, 40 TP53 mutations in 97 Arg72 homozygous cases (41.2%) versus 7 in 16 Pro72 homozygous cases (43.8%). These results suggest a selective growth advantage for cells carrying a type of TP53 mutation seen in breast carcinomas when the mutation resides on an Arg72 allele",

    "Abstract": "p53 gene alterations are among the most common events observed in colorectal cancer,and are accompanied frequently by DNA aneuploidy and high proliferative activity. The prognostic significance of such mutations remains controversial. We prospectively evaluated the prognostic significance of p53 mutations, DNA-ploidy, and S phase fraction (SPF) in a consecutive series of 160 colorectal cancer patients (median follow-up 71 months). Tumor DNA was screened for p53 mutations by PCR/single-strand conformational polymorphism/sequencing. DNA-ploidy and SPF were assessed by DNA flow cytometry. p53 mutations were detected in 68 of 160 (42.5%) cases. In 56% (38 of 68) of these, p53 mutations were found in conserved areas of the gene and in 44% (30 of 68 cases) outside the conserved regions. Eighteen of the 68 cases (26%) had mutations in the L3 loop, 11 of 68 (16%) in the L1 loop-sheet-alpha helix motif, and 39 of 68 (58%) outside L3 and loop-sheet-alpha helix. Seventy-five percent of the cases (120 of 160) showed DNA aneuploidy, whereas 18% of these (22 of 120) were multiclonal. The major independent predictors for both disease relapse and death were advanced Dukes' stage, p53 mutations affecting L3 loop, DNA-aneuploid tumors, and high SPF (>18.5%). Our results show that mutations in L3 functional domain, more than any mutations, are important biological indicators to predict the outcome of patients indicating that these mutations have biological relevance in terms of colorectal cancer disease course",

    "Abstract": "During a search for causative genes in patients with concurrent multiple primary colon tumours, we found a novel case with a germline mutation of the p53 gene, from GCC (Ala) to GTC (Val) at codon 189. Of the six primary colon tumours that this patient had, one large advanced carcinoma exhibited a somatic p53 mutation and a somatic APC mutation, in addition to the germline p53 mutation. Two early carcinomas and three adenomas had somatic APC mutations but no somatic p53 mutation or loss of the p53 allele. K-ras-2 mutations were detected in an advanced carcinoma and an early carcinoma. The present results suggest that a patient with a certain type of germline p53 mutation is predisposed to concurrent multiple colon tumours. It is also suggested that in such a patient, a somatic APC mutation is involved in tumour formation and that an additional somatic p53 mutation contributes to tumour progression",

    "Title": "Expression and alteration of ras and p53 proteins in patients with lung carcinoma accompanied by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The ras oncogene and the p53 tumor suppressor gene play important roles in the carcinogenic process of lung carcinoma. The authors evaluated whether alterations of the ras and p53 proteins may contribute to the development of lung carcinoma in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and whether such alterations may explain the high incidence of lung carcinoma among patients with IPF. METHODS: Lung tissues were obtained from 35 patients who had IPF without complications of lung carcinoma and from 36 patients who had IPF with complications of lung carcinoma. Altered expression of ras and p53 proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and mutations of both genes were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analyses. RESULTS: The frequency of expression of ras protein in type II alveolar pneumocytes was significantly greater in lung tissues from patients with IPF who had lung carcinoma compared with lung tissues from patients with IPF who did not have lung carcinoma (75% vs. 40%, respectively; P < 0.01). K-ras point mutation in codon 12 (GGT to GTT transversion) was detected in lung tissue with interstitial pneumonia, in which ras protein was overexpressed in type II alveolar pneumocytes obtained from 2 of 41 patients with IPF complicated by lung carcinoma, causing amino acid substitution (Gly to Val) in both patients. A p53 mutation was detected in three of six lung tissue samples from patients who had IPF lung with positive p53 immunoreactivity, and multiple mutations were detected in two samples. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of ras protein in type II alveolar pneumocytes and mutation in the codon 12 of K-ras gene in lung tissue may contribute to the induction of lung carcinoma in patients with IPF. Furthermore, the presence of multiple mutations in the p53 gene may explain the high incidence lung carcinoma in patients with IPF",

We report here evidence of increased in vitro radiation sensitivity in two cell lines that we have generated from two MCL patients (UPN1 and UPN2). However, despite their increased radiation sensitivity, UPN2 cells were totally resistant to apoptotic cell death, whereas UPN1 cells underwent massive apoptosis 6 h after irradiation. The frequency of induced chromosomal abnormalities was higher in UPN1 as compared to UPN2. Distinct mechanisms have been found to contribute to this phenotype: a major telomere shortening (UPN1 and UPN2), deletion of one ATM allele and a point mutation in the remaining allele in UPN2, mutation of p53 gene (UPN1 and UPN2) with absence of functional p53 as revealed by functional yeast assays. After irradiation, Ku70 levels in UPN1 increased and decreased in UPN2, whereas in the same conditions, DNA-PKcs protein levels decreased in UPN1 and remained unchanged in UPN2. Thus, irradiation-induced apoptotic cell death can occur despite the nonfunctional status of p53 (UPN1), suggesting activation of a unique pathway in MCL cells for the induction of this event. Overall, our study demonstrates that MCL cells show increased radiation sensitivity, which can be the result of distinct molecular events. These findings could clinically be exploited to increase the dismal response rates of MCL patients to the current chemotherapy regimens",

    "Title": "Amplification and overexpression of COPS3 in osteosarcomas potentially target TP53 for proteasome-mediated degradation",
    "Abstract": "In sarcomas, the TP53 tumour suppressor pathway may be altered either by TP53 mutations or by amplification of MDM2, encoding a protein that inhibits TP53 and targets it for 26S-proteasome degradation. However, in the majority of the analysed clinical samples, neither of these types of aberrations are found, suggesting that additional mechanisms are involved. The present study shows that COPS3, located in 17p11 and encoding a component of the proteasome pathway, is more frequently amplified in osteosarcomas (OS) than is MDM2. We present detailed analysis of TP53 mutations and MDM2 and COPS3 expression levels in a set of 23 OS. Our results show that none of the tumours with COPS3 amplification had MDM2 amplification nor TP53 mutations, consistent with the hypothesis that one of the three aberrations is sufficient. The results suggest that inactivation of otherwise intact TP53 by aberrations in the proteasome pathway may contribute to the characteristic aneuploidy observed in OS",

    "Title": "CP-31398, a novel p53-stabilizing agent, induces p53-dependent and p53-independent glioma cell death",
    "Abstract": "CP-31398 is a prototype small molecule that stabilizes the active conformation of p53 and promotes p53 activity in cancer cell lines with mutant or wild-type p53. Here, we report that CP-31398 induces p53 reporter gene activity and p21 expression in all of 11 glioma cell lines harboring wild-type or mutant p53, but not in p53-null LN-308 cells. Upon prolonged exposure to CP-31398, all glioma cell lines undergo caspase-independent and bcl-x(L)-insensitive cell death with EC(50) concentrations of 10-36 microM. By comparing p53 wild-type U87MG and p53-null LN-308 cells expressing the temperature-sensitive p53(V135A) mutant, we delineate two pathways of CP-31398-induced cell death: an early, p53-dependent pathway that requires (new p53) protein synthesis and a late, p53-independent pathway characterized by aurintricarboxylic acid -sensitive calcium release and epiphenomenal free radical formation. Post-transcriptional repression of p53 synthesis by an intracellularly transcribed short interfering RNA confirmed the presence of these two pathways of cell death. These observations point out some of the liabilities of CP-31398 as a prototype p53-based therapeutic and define a rationale for further refinement of small molecules that specifically target the p53 pathway, but lack the p53-independent effects",

    "Abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the NO synthase (NOS), a family of enzymes such as inducible NOS (iNOS), has been suggested to play an important role in tumor bioloty. We immunohistochemically examined iNOS and p53 protein expression in 105 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Direct sequence analysis for the p53 gene was performed in 51 of 105 tumors. In total, 56 of 105 (53.3%) tumors exhibited intracytoplasmic staining for anti-iNOS antibody, including 17 (16.2%) cases of homogeneous and intense immunostaining (++) and 39 (37.1%) of heterogeneous staining (+). Of 62 p53 protein-positive tumors, 40 (63.5%) were positive for iNOS, and of 43 p53 protein-negative tumors, 27 (62.8%) were negative for iNOS. Of 34 iNOS-positive tumors, 23 (67.6%) carried a p53 gene mutation, and of 17 iNOS-negative tumors, 12 (70.6%) had wild-type p53 gene. There was a significant relationship between iNOS immunoreactivity and p53 protein overexpression (p = 0.0058) as well as p53 mutation frequency (p = 0.0163). No association was found between iNOS immunoreactivity and p53 mutation type, any clinicopathological factor and patient prognosis. Our in vivo findings suggest that iNOS activity might be associated with p53 alteration and contribute to tumorigenesis in ESCC",

    "Title": "Clinical application of oligonucleotide probe array for full-length gene sequencing of TP53 in colon cancer",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: TP53 mutations are the most frequent genetic alterations in colon cancer. We studied whether the recently developed oligonucleotide microarray technique, GeneChip p53 assay, can be applied to sensitive detection of TP53 gene mutations in surgical specimens from colon cancer patients. METHODS: TP53 gene mutations in exons 2-11 in 20 colon cancers and the corresponding histopathologically normal mucosa at the surgical margins were assessed by GeneChip p53 assay, and the results were further evaluated by direct sequencing of the involved exon or by mutant-allele-specific amplification (MASA). The expression of TP53 protein was also evaluated immunohistochemically and the result was compared with the gene alteration. RESULTS: The GeneChip p53 assay detected TP53 mutations in 65% of primary cancers; 61% of the mutations were within the evolutionarily conserved regions, and 46% of the mutations were within the zinc-binding domains (regions of loop 2 and loop 3). Direct sequencing confirmed these mutations. Immunohistochemical examination detected TP53 protein overexpression in 47% of primary cancers, but this protein did not accumulate with all types of TP53 mutations. In addition, the GeneChip assay detected a mutation identical to that in the primary tumor in 2 samples from the surgical margins, and MASA confirmed both mutations, implying the presence of occult cancer cells. CONCLUSION: The GeneChip p53 assay is sufficiently sensitive to detect TP53 mutations in surgical specimens from colon cancers and may be applicable to screening examination in clinical laboratories as a routine procedure",

    "Title": "A novel case of a CAT to AAT transversion in codon 179 of the p53 gene in a supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor harbored by a young girl. Case report and review of the literature",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The most common cytogenetic abnormality encountered in primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET)/medulloblastoma is loss of heterozygosity in the region of the short arm of chromosome 17. There is some evidence that supratentorial PNET has different cytogenetic markers than infratentorial PNET/medulloblastoma. Particularly, loss of 17p is more frequent in the latter than in the former. We describe a young girl diagnosed with supratentorial PNET (SPNET). Analysis of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in the tumorous tissue revealed a rare transversion mutational event of CAT to AAT in position 179 of exon 5. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of such a transversion at codon 179 in the p53 gene in SPNET. CASE REPORT: A 12-year-old girl was admitted with nausea, headache and vision disturbances. MRI of the brain showed a large space- occupying lesion in the right frontal lobe. Histological examination of the macroscopic resection of the tumor revealed PNET of the brain. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of all p53 exons was performed, and a unique variant of a transversion at codon 179 of exon 5 was revealed. Therapy was started according to the Children's Cancer group protocol (CCG-99702) designated for treatment of high-risk central nervous system embryonal tumors. She received an initial course of chemotherapy, consisting of cyclophosphamide and vincristine for mobilizing and harvesting peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs). Then she was given craniospinal irradiation (3,600 cGy) with a boost to the tumor bed (1,980 cGy) and three consecutive courses of high-dose chemotherapy with carboplatin, vincristine and thiotepa/cyclophosphamide, with PBSCs support after each course. RESULTS: The patient is in complete remission 17 months after diagnosis, based on the results of physical examination and imaging studies. DISCUSSION: The mutation results in an alteration of the amino acid HIS to ASN. The amino acids surrounding position 175 play an important role in stabilizing the p53/DNA complex. There are only 12 known mutations of the reported type, and the finding of such a rare mutational event in a low-incidence p53 mutation tumor, such as SPNET, might add additional insight into the p53-SPNET relationship in tumorigenesis. Although not widely accepted, it is possible that different mutations of the p53 gene in patients with brain tumors may imply a different ultimate prognosis. In our case, we cannot exclude the fact that transversion of CAT to AAT in position 179 of exon 5 may explain prolonged survival of a patient with good response to therapy",

    "Title": "Molecular characterization of human prostate carcinoma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study presents a comprehensive survey and characterization of available prostate carcinoma cell lines, most of which have been widely used but are incompletely characterized. METHODS: A total of 21 cell lines were investigated, including three &quot;classical&quot; (DU 145, LNCaP, and PC-3) and 18 &quot;non-classical&quot; lines (1013L, 22Rv1, ALVA-55, ALVA-101, ARCaP, CWR-R1, DuCaP, DuPro-1, LAPC-4, MDA PCa 1, MDA PCa 2a, MDA PCa 2b, NCI-H660, PC-346C, PC-93, PSK-1, UM-SCP-1, and VCaP). Cytogenetics, DNA profiling, expression of basal, luminal, and neuroendocrine differentiation markers, and mutation analyses of the TP53 and androgen receptor (AR) genes were performed. RESULTS: Based on cytogenetics and DNA profiling analyses, out of the 18 &quot;non-classical&quot; lines, six were confirmed to be unique, eight (in four pairs) were confirmed to be related in origin, and four lines were identified as cross-contaminants. Of this latter group, PC-93 was found to be a derivative of HeLa, whereas DuPro-1, ALVA-55, and ALVA-101 were derivatives of PC-3. The 17 genuine prostate cell lines expressed keratin 8 (K8) and K18. Nine showed AR expression, of which five harbored mutations in the AR gene. Prostate-specific antigen and DD3 were exclusively detected in AR expressing cell lines. Seven lines expressed the basal cell marker K5, three of these lines showed co-expression of AR. CONCLUSIONS: This study defines a collection of 17 genuine prostate carcinoma cell lines. This collection, although small, constitutes a variety of different types and stages of prostate cancer, while it also partly reflects the heterogeneous nature of this malignancy",

    "Abstract": "To clarify the role of p53 in 22 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), we compared the gene expression profiles of HCCs with wild-type p53 (wt-p53) (n=17) and those with mutant-type p53 (mt-p53) (n=5) by oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Among 83 p53-related genes identified by a supervised learning method, 25 were underexpressed, and 58 were overexpressed in mt-p53 HCCs compared with wt-p53 HCCs. With a computer search, we identified consensus p53-binding sequences in the 3-kb region upstream of the translation initiation site in 59 of the 83 genes, suggesting that the in vivo p53-associated transcription system is very complicated. These data will provide additional insights into p53-related pathogenesis in HCV-infected HCC",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: A critical factor for successful organ preservation treatment in head and neck cancer may be selecting tumors that respond to chemotherapy and radiation. Previous results in patients indicated that tumors that overexpressed p53 were more sensitive to chemotherapy than those that did not overexpress p53. METHODS: To determine the relationship of p53 mutations to sensitivity to cisplatin in vitro, 23 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines were analyzed for cisplatin sensitivity, p53 expression, and p53 mutation status. RESULTS: Mutations of the p53 gene were identified in 13 of 23 of the cell lines tested. Mutation of the p53 gene was significantly associated with high levels of expression of the p53 protein. The average ID(50) (drug dose required to inhibit 50% of cell growth) for cell lines with mutant p53 was 6.8 microM, whereas the average ID(50) for cell lines with wild-type p53 was 13.7 microM. CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro data support a role for mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene as a marker for response to cisplatin in HNSCC",

    "Title": "Detection and assignment of TP53 mutations in tumor DNA using peptide mass signature genotyping",
    "Abstract": "This report describes the application of a new approach to tumor genotyping called peptide mass signature genotyping (PMSG) that is particularly suited to detecting minority sequences in a DNA sample. Detecting minority sequences is essential for accurate tumor genotyping because tumor resections are generally a mixture of malignant and non-malignant cells, with the mutations of interest often outnumbered by the corresponding wild-type alleles. To explore the suitability of PMSG for tumor genotyping, 25 human squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, as well as a set of cell lines derived from those tumors, were analyzed for mutations in exons 5 to 8 of the TP53 gene, the exons that encode the DNA-binding domains of the p53 protein. PMSG identified mutations in 11 tumor DNA samples, whereas dideoxy sequencing of the same samples detected mutations in only four. Currently, PMSG can be used to detect mutations that are present in only 20% of the sample DNA, and we expect that this threshold will be lowered significantly as the PMSG process is improved.

    "Title": "Molecular analysis of astrocytomas presenting after age 10 in individuals with NF1",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fifteen to 20% of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop low-grade astrocytomas. Although brain tumors are less common in teenagers and adults with NF1, recent studies have suggested that patients with NF1 are at a significantly increased risk of developing astrocytomas. OBJECTIVE:S: To investigate the genetic basis for astrocytoma development in patients with NF1 beyond the first decade of life. METHODS: The authors performed molecular genetic analyses of 10 NF1-associated astrocytomas representing all World Health Organization (WHO) malignancy grades using fluorescence in situ hybridization, loss of heterozygosity, immunohistochemistry, and direct sequencing. RESULTS: Later-onset NF1-associated astrocytomas, unlike histologically identical sporadic astrocytomas, exhibit NF1 inactivation, supporting a direct association with NF1 rather than a chance occurrence. Furthermore, some of these astrocytomas have homozygous NF1 deletion. In addition, genetic changes observed in high-grade sporadic astrocytomas, including TP53 mutation and CDKN2A/p16 deletion, are also seen in NF1-associated high-grade astrocytomas. CONCLUSIONS: Neurofibromatosis type 1-associated astrocytomas occurring in patients older than 10 years exhibit genetic changes observed in sporadic high-grade astrocytomas. Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and germline NF1 deletions may be at risk for developing late-onset astrocytomas",

    "Abstract": "Circulating DNA can be isolated from serum of patients with various carcinomas and p53 mutation can be observed in colorectal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between p53 mutation in DNA extracted from colorectal carcinoma and that in DNA extracted from serum of patients with colorectal carcinoma. The clinical significance in molecular detection of p53 mutation in serum of patients with colorectal carcinomas was also investigated. DNA was extracted from tumors and non-tumorous colorectal tissues of 46 patients with single sporadic colorectal carcinomas of stage I (n=6), stage II (n=18), stage III (n=15), and stage IV (n=7) according to the TNM classification. Circulating DNA was also extracted from the serum of the 46 patients with colorectal carcinoma and from 7 healthy volunteers for normal control. Mutations of the p53 gene were analyzed using a fluorescence-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method. DNA sequences were determined in DNA fragments with shifted peaks by SSCP methods. Mutations in tumors were found in 22 (48%) of 46 patients, and mutations in serum were found in 3 (14%) of these 22 patients. Of 4 patients with stage IV disease, 3 (75%) had serum p53 mutation and the mutation pattern of these 3 patients was the same in both tumor and serum. No correlation was seen between p53 mutation in serum and the level of serum DNA. There was no significant difference between the presence of p53 mutation in serum and tumor size, depth of invasion, vascular invasion, or lymph node metastasis. However, liver metastasis showed significant difference (p=0.0026). The presence of p53 mutation in serum was associated with a clinically advanced stage accompanied by liver metastasis",

    "Title": "P53 mutations as an identification marker for the clonal origin of bladder tumors and its recurrences",
    "Abstract": "The clonality of synchronous and metachronous bladder tumors has been studied for years with controversial results. Some recent studies support the 'polyclonal origin' hypothesis, i.e. that independently transformed different tumor cell clones exist in the same bladder cancer patient and arise from the field cancerogenisation affecting the entire bladder urothelium by environmental mutagens. Others could demonstrate a monoclonal origin of primary bladder tumors and its recurrences due to a single genetically transformed cell clone spread through the urinary system. With increasing understanding of the clonal origin of bladder tumors and recurrences, clonality markers might contribute to an early and accurate prediction of tumor recurrence and progression. We used p53 mutations as an identification marker permitting the prediction of clonality in bladder tumors and its recurrences. Primary tumors (n=33) and recurrences (n=63) were screened by direct genomic sequencing the p53 mutation hot spot region, exons 5-8. P53 mutations occurred in 12% in our cohort, predominantly in higher malignant (&gt;or=G2), invasive (&gt;or=T1) tumor samples. We were able to demonstrate intratumoral heterogeneity regarding the p53 status and that recurrences may occur from genetically unrelated primary tumor sites. Some of our results argue for a polyclonal origin of synchronous and metachronous bladder tumors possibly due to the field effect in bladder carcinogenesis. Evidence for a monoclonal origin was found in two cases: one case with a high malignant primary tumor and 3 metachronous recurrences, all of them harbouring the same exon 8 mutation found in the primary tumor; one case with identical mutations of exon 8 in the primary and one recurrent tumor. For further implications concerning clonality of recurrent bladder tumors, p53 status should be combined with a broader range of markers such as CGH and LOH pattern",

    "Abstract": "Recent studies suggest that infection with high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common event in colon tumors. Infection by oncogenic HPV may result in functional inactivation of the p53 protein in absence of mutations. Thus far no studies have been made to examine the frequency of p53 mutations in HPV-associated colon cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interrelationship between p53 mutations and HPV infection. The 'hot-spot' region of the p53 gene for mutations was analyzed by PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing in HPV-positive tumor samples. Only 2 mutations were identified in 56 samples. This rate was much lower than reported for sporadic colon tumors. Our results indicate an inverse relationship between p53 mutations and HPV infection and suggest that p53 inactivation caused by HPV infection may play a role in the pathogenesis of colon cancer",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in bladder cancer: evidence for exogenous versus endogenous risk factors",
    "Abstract": "Bladder cancer is associated with smoking, occupational exposures, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1 and N-acetyltransferase (NAT) 2 polymorphisms that may influence carcinogen metabolism, but somatic p53mutations are often CpG dinucleotide G:C-A:T transitions that can occur spontaneously. We conducted a case-control study to determine whether p53mutation characteristics might distinguish cases with environmental versus endogenous causes. p53exons 4-9 were amplified from 146 bladder tumors by PCR, screened by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis, and sequenced. Thirty-one cases were p53-positive, and 112 were p53-negative (germ line or silent). G:C-A:T transitions were also subclassified as CpG or non-CpG. Cases and 215 clinic controls were interviewed. GSTM1, NAT1, and NAT2 polymorphisms were assayed from peripheral blood. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using logistic and polytomous regression. Case-control ORs for smoking, occupations, and NAT1*10genotype were similar for p53-positive and p53-negative cases. Associations with GSTM1-null and NAT2-slow genotypes were somewhat stronger for p53-positive [OR, 3.3; CI, 1.4-7.8 (GSTM1 null); OR, 1.8; CI, 0.8-4.0 (NAT2 slow)] than p53-negative cases [OR, 1.5; CI:0.9-2.3 (GSTM1 null); OR, 0.9; CI, 0.6-1.4 (NAT2 slow)]. Smoking was strongly associated with CpG G:C-A:T (OR, 15.3; CI:3.6-65) versus other G:C-A:T (OR, 1.8; CI, 0.3-9.8). NAT2 slow genotypes were also associated with CpG G:C-A:T (OR, 6.2; CI:0.7-52), whereas GSTM1 null was associated with non-CpG G:C-A:T (OR, 7.8; CI, 0.9-65). Associations were not substantially different for case subtypes defined by p53mutation status alone. Estimates for p53 subtypes were imprecise but support in vitro evidence that some CpG G:C-A:T transitions may be caused by smoking and other environmental mutagens",

    "Title": "Selection pressures of TP53 mutation and microenvironmental location influence epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification in human glioblastomas",
    "Abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification occurs in glioblastomas as so-called double minutes. Because double minutes are extrachromosomal fragments, selection pressures must operate to maintain high EGFR copy number over multiple cell divisions. In analyses of glioblastoma lysates, EGFR amplification has been observed almost exclusively in glioblastomas harboring wild-type TP53 genes, which raises the alternative hypotheses that TP53 mutation either prevents amplification or selects against maintenance of EGFR-amplified cells. To address these possibilities at the cellular level, we studied 14 glioblastomas for TP53 mutation and EGFR gene amplification status, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the latter. Remarkably, four of the six cases with TP53 mutation had isolated EGFR-amplified cells in different regions, demonstrating that EGFR amplification occurs frequently at the cellular level in TP53-mutant glioblastomas. Thus, TP53 mutation does not prevent EGFR amplification but does not facilitate selection of EGFR-amplified cells. Of the eight cases without TP53 mutation, five had widespread EGFR amplification. In four of these five cases, multiple regions of the tumor were available for examination; FISH demonstrated a gradation of EGFR amplification, with highly amplified cells, primarily at the invading edges rather than the relatively solid tumor centers, suggesting that EGFR overexpression, when selected for in vivo, may be related to tumor invasion",

    "Title": "Carcinogenesis in MYH-associated polyposis follows a distinct genetic pathway",
    "Abstract": "Colorectal carcinomas develop according to particular genetic pathways, including the chromosomal instability (CIN+), microsatellite instability (MSI+) and MSI- CIN- routes. We have determined the genetic pathway in patients with MYH-associated polyposis (MAP), a syndrome of colorectal adenomas and cancer that results from defective base excision repair (BER). As in previous studies, MAP tumors showed a high frequency of G&gt;T mutations in APC, in accordance with defective BER. We found that K-ras mutations were common in MAP tumors, all of the changes comprising conversion of the first guanine residue of codon 12 to thymidine (G12C, GGT&gt;TGT). We found no BRAF mutations at the codon 599 hotspot or elsewhere in exon 14. Almost all of the MAP cancers were near-diploid (CIN-), and none was MSI+. A few p53 mutations were found, but these were not predominantly G&gt;T changes. p53 overexpression was, however, frequent. No SMAD4 or TGFBIIR mutations were found. MAP tumors appear to follow a distinct genetic pathway, with some features of both the CIN and MSI pathways. BER deficiency is rarely accompanied by CIN or MSI. The spectrum of somatic mutations in MAP tumors reflects both selection and hypermutation to which certain guanine residues are particularly prone",

    "Abstract": "FGFR3 and TP53 mutations are frequent in superficial papillary and invasive disease, respectively. We used denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing to screen for FGFR3 and TP53 mutations in 81 newly diagnosed urothelial cell carcinomas. Tumors were classified as follows: 31 pTa, 1 carcinoma in situ, 30 pT1, and 19 pT2-T4. Tumor grades were as follows: 10 G1, 29 G2, and 42 G3. FGFR3 mutations were associated with low-stage (P &lt; 0.0001), low-grade (P &lt; 0.008) tumors, whereas TP53 mutations were associated with high-stage (P &lt; 0.003), high-grade (P &lt; 0.02) tumors. Mutations in these two genes were almost mutually exclusive. Our results suggest that FGFR3 and TP53 mutations define separate pathways at initial diagnosis of urothelial cell carcinoma",

    "Title": "Analysis of p53, K-ras, c-kit, and beta-catenin gene mutations in sinonasal NK/T cell lymphoma in northeast district of China",
    "Abstract": "Recently we reported the different frequencies of p53 and c-kit gene mutations among sinonasal NK/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) in Korea, north China (Beijing), and Japan, suggesting some racial, environmental, or life-style differences as a possible cause of nasal tumorigenesis. In this study, gene mutations in p53, c-kit, K-ras, and beta-catenin gene were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) followed by direct sequencing in 20 cases of sinonasal NKTCL from northeast China (Shen Yang). Age of patients ranged from 5 to 63 (median, 40.0) years. p53 gene mutations were found in eight of 20 cases (40%), with exon 4 involvement in 10% of cases. The majority was missense mutations and G:C to A:T transition was predominant. The frequency of the c-kit and K-ras gene mutations was low (5%), while that of the beta-catenin gene was six of 20 cases (30%). From these findings, it is concluded that nasal NKTCL in northeast China shared common features with that in Korea in the younger onset of disease compared to that in Japan and lower frequency of p53 gene mutations with infrequent exon 4 involvement compared to that in Japan and north China. These differences might be caused by migration of susceptible populations or some environmental confounding factors",

    "Title": "Is atypical follicular adenoma of the thyroid a preinvasive malignancy?",
    "Abstract": "Among the follicular neoplasms of the thyroid, the definition and nature of atypical adenoma have been confusing. Despite the original speculation about the biologic behavior of preinvasive malignancies, this term is currently used as an expression of uncertainty. To examine the molecular features of a typical adenoma, we analyzed the p53 genes in 2 atypical adenomas and 12 control lesions (6 typical follicular adenomas and 6 follicular carcinomas). Mutations of p53 were detected in the bizarre cells of the atypical adenomas, but not in the bland-looking follicular cells or in the control specimens. Both atypical adenomas showed an identical point mutation in codon 273 (CGT--&gt;CAT), a common mutation in various human cancers, including anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid. This finding supports the view that atypical follicular adenoma is a precursor of thyroid anaplastic carcinoma and suggests that &quot;atypical adenoma&quot; should not be used to express diagnostic uncertainty about the nature of a lesion",

    "Title": "Characterization of a novel breast carcinoma xenograft and cell line derived from a BRCA1 germ-line mutation carrier",
    "Abstract": "A human tumor xenograft (L56Br-X1) was established from a breast cancer axillary lymph node metastasis of a 53-year-old woman with a BRCA1 germ-line nonsense mutation (1806C&gt;T; Q563X), and a cell line (L56Br-C1) was subsequently derived from the xenograft. The xenograft carries only the mutant BRCA1 allele and expresses mutant BRCA1 mRNA but no BRCA1 protein as determined by immunoprecipitation or Western blotting. The primary tumor, lymph node metastasis, and xenograft were hypodiploid by DNA flow cytometry, whereas the cell line displayed an aneuploidy apparently developed via polyploidization. Cytogenetic analysis, spectral karyotyping, and comparative genomic hybridization of the cell line revealed a highly complex karyotype with numerous unbalanced translocations. The xenograft and cell line had retained a somatic TP53 missense mutation (S215I) originating from the primary tumors, as well as a lack of immunohistochemically detectable expression of steroid hormone receptors, epidermal growth factor receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and keratin 8. Global gene expression analysis by cDNA microarrays supported a correlation between the expression profiles of the primary tumor, lymph node metastasis, xenograft, and cell line. We conclude that L56Br-X1 and L56Br-C1 are useful model systems for studies of the pathogenesis and new therapeutic modalities of BRCA1-induced human breast cancer",

    "Title": "Molecular analysis of peritoneal fluid in ovarian cancer patients",
    "Abstract": "To determine whether genetic abnormalities present in primary ovarian tumors can be used to detect cancer cells in peritoneal fluid, we tested 14 ovarian cancers and 1 benign tumor of the ovary for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosomal arms 13q, 17p, 17q, and 22q and for mutations in the p53 and K-ras genes. In each case, matched primary tumor, normal tissue, and peritoneal fluid were analyzed. The highest frequency of LOH was found on chromosomal arm 17p (42%), followed by chromosomal arm 17q (36%), 22q (30%), and 13q (21%). Identical alterations were detected in matched peritoneal fluid (either peritoneal wash or ascitic fluid) in 3 of the 8 patients with LOH in the tumor (38%). Direct sequence analysis detected p53 mutations in 3 of the 14 malignant tumors (21%) and no (0) K-ras mutations. Identical mutations were detected in matched peritoneal fluid from all 3 patients with p53 mutations. All 8 of the 14 (57%) malignant tumors that showed at least one genetic abnormality were serous adenocarcinoma and identical alterations were detected in 5 of the 8 (62%) matched peritoneal fluid samples. Our findings indicate that molecular abnormalities can be detected in peritoneal fluid from patients with ovarian cancer and may be used to complement current conventional diagnostic procedures for detection of primary ovarian cancer",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we focused on p53 mutations in specific regions, including DNA-binding surface regions, to clarify the correlation between mutations within the specific regions of p53 and clinical outcomes of patients with oral cancers. We analyzed p53 mutations in 121 fresh primary oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism or a yeast functional assay. p53 mutations were detected in 51/121 (42%) cases. Mutation of p53 was not associated with any clinicopathological parameters; however, tumors containing specific p53 mutations, e.g. DNA-binding surface regions (L2, L3 and the LSH motif) and conserved regions (II-V), had significantly poorer prognoses than tumors with mutations outside of those regions. Moreover, locoregional failure, lymph node metastasis and the occurrence of subsequent distant metastasis were also significantly associated with mutations within DNA-binding surface regions. These data indicate that specific mutations of p53 could be important prognostic factors in oral SCCs",

    "Title": "Microsatellite instability in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is not associated with hMLH1 promoter hypermethylation",
    "Abstract": "To test whether a subset of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) develop through a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair, we examined microsatellite instability (MSI) using 11 microsatellite markers including BAT-26, hMLH1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry, and methylation status of the hMLH1 promoter by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). p53 mutations were also investigated. Microsatellite instability at one or more loci was observed in 40% (12/30) of esophageal SCC tumor samples, although only one of these tumors was categorized as high-frequency MSI (MSI-H) and none showed BAT-26 instability. While immunohistochemistry revealed decreased hMLH1 protein expression in 27% (8/30) of the tumors, hMLH1 promoter hypermethylation was not observed. Absence of hMLH1 protein expression was relatively common in well-differentiated (keratinizing-type) esophageal SCC, but was not associated with hMLH1 promoter hypermethylation. p53 mutation was detected in 37% (11/30) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 90% (27/30) of esophageal SCC samples. Our results suggested that most esophageal SCC develop through defects in tumor suppressor genes (i.e. the suppressor pathway), and that MSI in esophageal SCC probably represent random replication errors rather than being associated with DNA mismatch repair deficiency",

    "Title": "Genetic analysis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas arising from different areas",
    "Abstract": "Although cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) occur most frequently in sun-exposed areas of the skin, they can also arise in non-sun-exposed areas. Some risk factors for cutaneous SCC, such as ultraviolet (UV) light, are well known. However, the major factor for carcinogenesis may depend on the site of the tumor as well as the ethnicity of the patient. In this study we examined 41 Japanese cutaneous SCC cases, focusing on the area of appearance and the presence of genetic alteration, with 27 cases from sun-exposed areas, 10 from non-sun-exposed areas (excluding genital areas), and four from burn scars from sun-exposed areas. Squamous cell carcinomas arising in sun-exposed areas showed less frequent p53 gene mutations compared to SCC arising in non-sun-exposed areas. Ultraviolet light-specific mutations were found in only two cases of SCC from sun-exposed areas. Human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA was detected in two cases (7.4%) of the sun-exposed areas and none of the non-sun-exposed or scar areas. The frequency of loss of heterozygosity on D5S178 in non-sun-exposed SCC was significantly higher than in sun-exposed SCC. Furthermore, the incidence of fractional allelic loss (FAL) was significantly higher in non-sun-exposed SCC than in sun-exposed SCC. Our findings suggest that sun-exposed SCC in Japan may be relatively less involved with p53 mutation, and that non-sun-exposed SCC acquire more genetic alterations than sun-exposed SCC",

    "Title": "Correlation between p53 mutations and HPV in bilharzial bladder cancer",
    "Abstract": "Alterations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most common genetic changes detected in human cancers as well as in papillary and invasive bladder cancer. Several studies have demonstrated an association between HPV infection and urological malignancies. In the present work, the p53 gene status was studied together with the frequency of HPV in 99 cases of Bilharzial bladder cancer [BBC] in Egypt and both were correlated to the clinicopathological features of the patients. SSCP and sequencing were used to screen the p53 gene for mutations at exons 4-10 and IHC was performed to detect protein overexpression. PCR was used for detection and typing of HPV-DNA in tumor samples. p53 mutations were detected in 33.3% of the studied cases whereas protein overexpression was detected in 35.6% of the cases. The highest concordance rate was observed in cases harboring mutations at exon 4 [87.5%]. Bilharzial infestation was obvious in 72.2% of the cases that showed mutations. Exon 8 showed the highest rate of mutation [32%] followed by exons 4 and 5 [22% each]. The commonest mutational event was G:C transversion [15/50] especially at CpG dinucleotides. A mutational hot spot was detected at exon 4, codons 72-73. HPV-DNA was detected in 48.97% of the cases the majority of which [64.6%] were of type 16. Significant correlation was found between p53 mutation and the pathological stage as well as p53 overexpression and tumor grade. Our results demonstrate that the mutational spectrum in BBC is different from that of bladder cancer in Western countries in many aspects and suggest an etiological role of HPV in this type of neoplasm. However, both HPV infection and p53 gene abnormalities may contribute to Bilharzial bladder carcinogenesis in an independent way",

    "Title": "Mutation of p53 in recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma and its association with the expression of ZBP-89",
    "Abstract": "p53 has recently been identified as a downstream target of ZBP-89, a zinc finger transcription factor. ZBP-89 promotes growth arrest through stabilization of the p53 protein. The aim of this study is to determine the status of the p53 gene in recurrent human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and test the link between the expression of ZBP-89 and the p53 gene. The results showed that mutations in the p53 gene were frequently detected in recurrent HCC. The interval between surgical resection and the recurrence of HCC was significantly longer in patients with the wild-type p53 gene than those with mutations, strongly suggesting a pathological role for the mutant p53 gene in HCC recurrence. Among those positive for the p53 protein, nearly 85% (18 of 21) showed nuclear localization of the p53 protein while only about 14% (3 of 21) were positive for the p53 protein in the cytoplasm. ZBP-89 co-localized with p53 in the nucleus in about 67% (12 of 18) of all cases positive for the nuclear p53 protein, suggesting that ZBP-89 may play a role in the nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein in a subset of recurrent HCC. With accumulation of p53 protein in the nucleus, tumor cells undergo apoptosis and thus are more susceptible to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Therefore, co-localization of p53 protein with ZBP-89 may define a subgroup of recurrent HCC that is more sensitive to treatment",

    "Abstract": "Abnormalities of the p53 gene are known to confer detrimental effects in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and are associated with short survival. We have used high dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) to treat 25 patients with advanced refractory CLL of whom 45% had p53 abnormalities shown by one or more methods: flow cytometry, fluorescent in situ hybridisation and direct DNA sequencing. Fifteen were resistant to fludarabine and 16 were non-responders to their most recent therapy. Methylprednisolone had a cytotoxic effect on lymphocytes from 95% of cases assessed by an ex vivo apoptotic drug sensitivity index (DSI). HDMP was given alone or in combination with other drugs: vincristine, CCNU, Ara-C, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and chlorambucil, according to the results of DSI. Three patients were treated twice and each treatment was analysed separately. The overall response rate was 77% with a median duration of 12 months (range 7 -23+). Responders included 5/10 with abnormal p53, of which two achieved nodular PR. Patients with p53 abnormalities fared worse than those with normal p53. There were no differences in response according to whether HDMP was used alone or in combination. Nine of the 22 evaluable patients (3 NR and 6 PR) have died from progressive disease or transformation. Main toxicity was infection in 7/25 patients. Event free and overall survival were significantly better in responders vs non-responders ( P&gt;0.0001 and P=0.04 respectively). Patients with a DSI of 100% to steroids had a better overall and event free survival, but this was not statistically significant. This study demonstrates that HDMP alone or in combination with other agents is a useful treatment strategy in refractory CLL including patients with p53 abnormalities",

    "Title": "Cell cycle checkpoint status in human malignant mesothelioma cell lines: response to gamma radiation",
    "Abstract": "Knowledge of the function of the cell cycle checkpoints in tumour cells may be important to develop treatment strategies for human cancers. The protein p53 is an important factor that regulates cell cycle progression and apoptosis in response to drugs. In human malignant mesothelioma, p53 is generally not mutated, but may be inactivated by SV40 early region T antigen (SV40 Tag). However, the function of p53 has not been investigated in mesothelioma cells. Here, we investigated the function of the cell cycle checkpoints in six human mesothelioma cell lines (HMCLs) by studying the cell distribution in the different phases of the cell cycle by flow cytometry, and expression of cell cycle proteins, p53, p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27(KIP1). In addition, we studied p53 gene mutations and expression of SV40 Tag. After exposure to gamma-radiation, HMCLs were arrested either in one or both phases of the cell cycle, demonstrating a heterogeneity in cell cycle control. G1 arrest was p21(WAF1/CIP1)- and p53-dependent. Lack of arrest in G1 was not related to p53 mutation or binding to SV40 Tag, except in one HMCL presenting a missense mutation at codon 248. These results may help us to understand mesothelioma and develop new treatments",

    "Abstract": "Oesopharyngeal brush (OPB) sampling with cytological analysis can yield exfoliated cells from asymptomatic tumours of the upper aero-digestive tract and the oesophagus. In this study, we compared cytological evaluation and molecular analysis for the detection of exfoliated cancer cells sampled with an OPB. A total of 56 patients with a known unique head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and five healthy controls were enrolled prospectively. Exfoliated cells from these 61 patients were collected with an OPB before initial endoscopy. p53 mutations and UT 5085 microsatellite instability (MI) were analysed in the HNSCC tumour, lymphocytes and the corresponding OPB DNA samples. p53 mutations and UT5085 MI were detected in 31 out of 56 and 14 out of 56 HNSCC, respectively, but not in any of the five controls. Direct sequencing of p53 was able to detect mutations in OPB DNA in only two out of 29 patients harbouring a p53-mutated primary tumour. Microsatellite instability was detected in OPB DNA of 11 out of 13 informative (bandshift detected in tumour) patients, whereas cytological analysis detected abnormal cells in only six of the same 13 patients (P=0.03). In informative patients, all positive OPB samples at cytological analysis were also positive at molecular analysis of UT5085, and both analyses confirmed the two negative samples. Molecular analysis of OPB from eight uninformative patients and from five healthy controls were all negative. OPB sampling with MI-based molecular analysis could be efficient for early detection of recurrent HNSCC. This result prompts us to use other microsatellite markers in order to maximise the percentage of informative patients",

    "Abstract": "p53 mutations and loss of heterozygosity have been commonly associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma. In this investigation, the p53 status of a Welsh population of Barrett's-associated oesophageal adenocarcinomas were fully characterised at the gene sequence, chromosomal, mRNA and protein levels. In total, 31 tumours were examined for p53 gene sequence mutations using RFLP with sequencing, allelic loss of the gene was characterised by FISH, mRNA expression by p53 pathway signalling arrays and protein levels by p53 immunohistochemistry. In all, 9.6% of adenocarcinomas harboured p53 mutations, 24% displayed p53 allelic loss and 83% exhibited p53 protein accumulation. Point mutations and deletions of the gene did not coexist within the same samples. All samples containing p53 mutations also displayed positive immunostaining; however; in the majority of cases, p53 protein accumulation developed in the absence of mutations. The gene expression analysis demonstrated no differences in p53 and mdm-2 transcription levels between the p53 immunonegative and immunopositive samples, indicating other mechanisms underlie the proteins' overexpression. In conclusion, p53 mutations and deletions do not appear to be frequent events in oesophageal adenocarcinomas; however, abnormal accumulation of the protein is present in a vast majority of cases. P53 gene mutations are not the primary cause of protein overexpression--an alternative mechanism is responsible for the positive p53 immunohistochemistry detected",

We examined 32 primary prostate tumours and three prostate tumour cell lines for mutations by PCR amplification and direct dideoxy sequencing (KLF6), and by oligonucleotide microarray (p53GeneChip) analysis and dideoxy sequencing (TP53).

    "Title": "ING1 and p53 tumor suppressor gene alterations in adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction",
    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to characterize molecular alterations of the recently reported candidate tumor suppressor gene, ING1, and to explore the relationship between ING1 and p53 in a well-defined series of adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction (AdEGJ). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays were used to characterize ING1 and p53 alterations, relative to histologically normal esophageal mucosa. Two tumors were found to have ING1 mutations: one novel missense mutation (AGC(Ser)--&gt;ATC(Ile)) at codon 147, and one silent mutation (TCG(Ser)--&gt;TCA(Ser)) at codon 173. Reduced expression of the two major alternatively spliced ING1 messenger RNA variants, p47(ING1a) and p33(ING1b) was variable, but was reduced (1.2-10-fold) in 12 of 19 AdEGJs compared to normal esophageal epithelium. No association between p53 and ING1 alterations was apparent. We conclude that reduced ING1 expression is frequently associated with AdEGJ tumorigenesis, further supporting its role as a tumor suppressor gene, and that ING1 expression is independent of p53 status",

    "Abstract": "The p53 mutations in betel-related oral cancer have been studied but the results may be confounded by tobacco and alcohol due to tobacco components in the quid or concomitant habits of smoking and drinking. In this study, p53 mutations in tumors from Thai betel chewers who neither smoke nor drink were studied in comparison to tumors from smokers/drinkers. PCR-SSCP analysis and direct sequencing on exon 5-8 were performed. Mutations were detected in 11.8% (8/68) of betel-related tumors and 7 of 8 mutations were G:C to A:T transitions. By contrast, mutations were found in 22.4% (13/58) of smoking/drinking-related tumors with various base substitutions. The results demonstrated different mutation profiles between the two exposed groups. The type of mutation detected in betel chewers suggested a possible role of areca-specific nitrosamine as a causative carcinogen",

    "Title": "Genetic pathways of 'de novo' colorectal carcinomas with reference to fetal-type glycogen phosphorylase positive foci",
    "Abstract": "'De novo' carcinogenesis has been advocated besides 'adenoma carcinoma sequence' as another dominant pathway leading to the colorectal carcinoma. Our previous study demonstrated that brain (fetal)-type glycogen phosphorylase (BGP) positive foci in the transitional mucosa (BGP foci) have frequent p53 mutations and that the distribution of BGP foci has a close relationship with the location of 'de novo' carcinoma. The aims of the present study were to investigate further genetic alterations in the BGP foci and to clarify the mechanism of 'de novo' carcinogenesis. Twenty-eight colorectal carcinomas with invasion into submucosa or superficial muscularis propria without any adenoma component expressing immunoreactive p53 protein were selected from 168 resected specimens. Investigations of the p53, K-ras and APC mutations was performed in the BGP foci, BGP negative colorectal mucosa and 'de novo' carcinoma using PCR-SSCP and DNA squencing. In all 28 cases, immunoreactive BGP was positive in the carcinomas and the BGP foci were observed sporadically in the mucosa adjacent to the carcinoma. No K-ras mutation was observed in either carcinoma or BGP foci in any of the cases. Mutations of p53 and APC were 14 (50.0%) and 9 (32.1%) in 'de novo' carcinomas, and 11 (39.3%) and 1 (3.6%) in BGP foci, respectively. Both p53 and APC mutations were detected in 8 and 1, p53 mutation alone in 6 and 10, APC mutation alone in 1 and 0 out of 28 carcinomas and BGP positive foci, respectively. These results suggest that the BGP foci may play a very important role in the 'de novo' colorectal carcinogenesis from the frequent genetic alterations of p53, and that there may be two major pathways, i.e., the p53-APC pathway and the p53 alone pathway, from the chain of genetic alterations between BGP foci and 'de novo' carcinoma",

    "Title": "TP53 mutations in primary breast carcinomas from white and African-Brazilian patients",
    "Abstract": "We have attempted to determine the incidence, nature and clinical significance of TP53 mutation in a group of white (242 cases) and African-Brazilian (52 cases) patients with breast cancer. The interethnic admixture as estimated by STR markers showed that white subjects displayed 67.9+/-0.4%, 25.0+/-1.7% and 7.0%+/-1.6% and the black populations had 34.4+/-1.9%, 56.2+/-1.9 and 9.4+/-2.2% respectively of European, African and Amerindian genes. Clinical parameters such as age, lymph node status and steroid receptors were similar in both groups. African-Brazilian patients presented more advanced lesions. Mutation screening was performed using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation analysis followed by sequencing. Compared to whites (13.6%), a relatively high frequency of TP53 mutation was found in blacks (32.7%) (p=0.001). African-Brazilian women have a larger proportion of mutations in exons 5 and 7, whereas white women have more mutations in exon 8. Mutations within exon 4 were found only in tumors of white patients. The spectra of TP53 mutations show that A:T right curved arrow G:C nucleotide transversion and G:C right curved arrow C:G transition were more common in African-Brazilian women whereas G:C right curved arrow T:A transversion occurs very frequently in whites. A high prevalence of G:C right curved arrow A:T nucleotide transitions and deletions was detected in both groups. No association was found between p53 gene mutation and tumor or clinical parameters independently of the ethnic group. With a median follow-up of 35.6 months for whites and 43.4 months for the blacks, no differences in overall survival were found. If white patients were stratified according to the type and location of TP53 mutations, patients with mutations affecting amino acids directly involved in DNA or Zn binding displayed a poor prognosis. The pattern of mutations found in our population seems to reflect a base line pattern observed in populations with similar ethnic profile with some modifications, which might be derived from specific etiological factors",

    "Title": "High frequency of temperature-sensitive mutations of p53 tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia revealed by functional assay in yeast",
    "Abstract": "The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that participates in control of many cellular functions. All these activities are mediated by direct binding of the p53 tetramer to specific target sequences in promoters of directed genes. Lack of p53 function is often connected with development of cancer, but the frequency of p53 mutations is low in almost all types of leukemia. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of mutations in the p53 gene in leukocytes of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using the FASAY functional analysis and to assess the relationship between the presence of p53 mutation and disease outcome. The following observations were made: i) the presence of p53 mutations was detected in 13 of 62 tested AML cases (21%) and in 1 of 4 tested myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases by FASAY; ii) the presence of p53 mutation was shown to be a poor prognostic/predictive factor in AML (p=0.03/0.002); iii) although there is a statistically significant relationship between the presence of p53 mutation and p53 protein accumulation (p=0.05), not all samples having p53 mutation exhibited p53 protein accumulation; iv) five of 13 p53 mutations detected in the leukocytes of AML patients (38.5%) and the mutation detected in the leukocytes of the MDS patient (altogether 6/14-42.9%) were partially inactivating ts mutations. The high frequency of the ts p53 mutations in our study; and a novel modification in performing FASAY, are discussed; v) different ts mutations differ in the level of their temperature sensitivity and in their responsiveness to the cytoprotective drug amifostine",

    "Title": "Heterogeneous gene alterations in primary breast cancer contribute to discordance between primary and asynchronous metastatic/recurrent sites: HER2 gene amplification and p53 mutation",
    "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to clarify differences in genetic events between primary breast cancers and asynchronous metastatic/recurrent lesions, by examining HER2 gene amplification and p53 mutation. The subjects were 44 breast cancer patients with asynchronous metastasis or recurrence. Synchronous metastases were excluded. HER2 overexpression and gene amplification were examined using immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). P53 point mutation was examined by immunohistochemistry, laser-captured microdissection, PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism, and a direct sequencing method. Immunohistochemistry showed that, for HER2, p53, ER and PgR, discordance rates between primary and recurrent tumor were 2 (4.5%), 1 (2.3%), 7 (15.9%) and 10 (22.7%), respectively. Two primary tumors with discordant HER2 overexpression were composed of at least two populations of carcinoma cells, with and without HER2 gene amplification. Distribution of HER2 gene amplification was consistent with protein overexpression. Corresponding recurrent tumors consisted of carcinoma cells without HER2 gene amplification. Of 6 recurrent tumors in which the primary carcinoma had a p53 point mutation, 3 tumors had identical mutations, 1 tumor had a different point mutation, and 2 tumors had no mutation. It was suspected that the latter 3 recurrent tumors comprised a minor component of the primary tumor. In the present study, we examined a large series of asynchronous recurrent tumors. A limited number of these tumors showed discordance between primary and recurrent tumors. Detailed observations revealed that cell populations present in recurrent tumors were also present in the primary tumors, although they comprised a minor component of the primary tumor. Heterogeneity of the primary tumor apparently contributed to discordance",

    "Title": "HBV DNA integration and HBV-transcript expression in non-B, non-C hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan",
    "Abstract": "Few studies have examined the etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients without hepatitis virus infection. We evaluated the role of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the development of HCC in Japanese patients without hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to hepatitis C antigen (anti-HCV). Twenty-one HBsAg negative and anti-HCV negative (non-B, non-C) patients with HCC were studied. HBV DNA in serum and HBV transcripts in liver were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription and PCR. HBV DNA integration was examined by Southern blot analysis or cassette-ligation-mediated PCR as described previously. p53 mutations were examined by direct sequencing. HBV DNA was not detected in serum from any patients. HBV-related transcripts were detected in 5 of 7 HCCs from patients with antibodies to hepatitis core antigen (anti-HBc) and in 3 of 14 HCCs from patients without anti-HBc (P = 0.0261). HBV DNA was integrated into human genome in two non-B, non-C HCCs. Of the 14 patients without anti-HBc, 5 had a history of excessive alcohol intake. In exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene, mutations were detected in 2 of 8 HCCs with HBV-transcripts and in 5 of 13 HCCs without such transcripts. p53 mutation at codon 159 was found in 2 of 6 patients with excessive alcohol intake without HBV-transcripts. These results suggested that occult HBV infection might play an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis in non-B, non-C patients with anti-HBc and that excessive alcohol intake might be related to HCC in non-B, non-C patients in Japan",

    "Title": "Simultaneous use of DGGE and DHPLC to screen TP53 mutations in cancers of the esophagus and cardia from a European high incidence area (Lower Normandy, France)",
    "Abstract": "We investigated TP53 mutation patterns in cancers of the esophagus and cardia of patients coming from Lower Normandy, a region situated in the highest incidence area in Europe. To screen tumor samples, we first used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), a well-characterized technique which constituted our reference method. Then the results were compared with those obtained by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), a recent and automatic screening technology. Analysis of the TP53 mutations profile showed that the detected alterations were mainly point mutations. Ninety-seven percent (33/34) of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma samples presented at least one mutation or polymorphism. The proportion of somatic, non-silent and sequence-confirmed mutations was 76% (26/34). The most common substitutions were G-->A transitions, which could be related to nitrosamines, acetaldehyde or factors prone to producing mucosal irritation, like hot beverages. G-->T transversions, which were also frequently detected, could originate from benzo[a]pyrene in tobacco smoke. A-->T transversions were not revealed in our series, which constitutes a discordance with mutational spectra already performed in north-western France. Concerning adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and cardia, the alteration frequency was 69% (11/16), with a majority of G-->A transitions at CpG dinucleotides. They are probably related to endogenous process mediated by inflammatory diseases like gastro-esophageal reflux and Barrett's esophagus. The main advantage provided by DHPLC was its ease of application. However, the optimization steps turned out to be quite critical, especially for sequences with high melting temperatures embedded in lower melting temperature fragments. Considering only the common sequences analyzed by the two techniques, four of the 46 positive samples detected by DGGE were not revealed by DHPLC. This result stresses the limited sensitivity of DHPLC compared with DGGE under the conditions described in this study",

    "Title": "Independent molecular development of metachronous glioblastomas with extended intervening recurrence-free interval",
    "Abstract": "Two metachronous glioblastomas with different cerebral locations in a 53-year-old long-term survival patient were analyzed by multiple genetic approaches. Using comparative genomic hybridization a different pattern of chromosomal aberrations was observed, with 19 imbalances in the first tumor and only 2 imbalances in the second. Sequence analysis revealed a distinct mutation profile in each tumor, with amino acid substitutions in the p53 and PTEN genes only in the first tumor, ie, p53 in codon 273 (CGT--&gt;TGT, Arg--&gt;Cys) and PTEN in codon 336 (TAC--&gt;TTC, Tyr--&gt;Phe). A splicing acceptor site PTEN mutation (IVS8-2A&gt;G) was observed only in the second GBM. EGFR amplification, mutations of p16INK4a/CDKN2A or p14ARF were not observed. According to the results of p53 mutational analysis and EGFR amplification studies, the first tumor is classified as a type 1 GBM, whereas the alterations in the second one are different from those typically encountered in type 1 or type 2 tumors. In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that the metachronous tumors in this patient are exceptional in that they developed independently from each other. Whether the molecular features of the first glioblastoma are associated with the notably extended recurrence-free period of 5 years remains to be elucidated",

    "Title": "Granular cell astrocytomas show a high frequency of allelic loss but are not a genetically defined subset",
    "Abstract": "Granular cell astrocytomas (GCA) are an uncommon morphologic variant of infiltrative glioma that contains a prominent population of atypical granular cells. As a rule, they are biologically aggressive compared to similar tumors without granular features. We sought to determine whether GCAs possess distinct genotypic alterations that might reflect their unique morphology or clinical behavior. Eleven GCAs occurring in 7 men and 4 women ranging in age from 46 to 75 years were investigated for genetic alterations of known significance in glial tumorigenesis, including LOH at 1p, 9p, 10q, 17p, and 19q, point mutations of TP53, deletions of p16(CDKN2A) and p14ARF, as well as EGFR amplifications. Tumors included had an infiltrative growth pattern and consisted of large, round cells packed with eosinophilic, PAS-positive granules that varied in quantity, ranging from 30 to 100% of tumor cells. Three tumors were of WHO grade II, one was grade III, and 7 were grade IV lesions. Overall, the tumors showed higher frequencies of LOH at 1p, 9p, 10q, 17p, and 19q than typical infiltrating astrocytomas of similar grades. Losses on 9p and 10q occurred in nearly all cases, including low grade lesions. TP53 mutations were identified in 2 grade IV GCAs, while combined p14ARF and p16(CDKN2A) homozygous deletions were noted in only one grade IV lesion. None showed EGFR amplification. We found no genetic alterations specific for GCA. Instead, it appears that granular cell change occurs across genetic subsets. The high frequency of allelic loss, especially on 9p and 10q, may confer aggressive growth potential and be related to their rapid clinical progression",

    "Title": "Relationship between E-cadherin gene mutation and p53 gene mutation, p53 accumulation, Bcl-2 expression and Ki-67 staining in diffuse-type gastric carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "E-cadherin mutations are found in 50% of diffuse-type gastric carcinoma, but not in intestinal gastric carcinoma. Because cell-cell adhesion mediated by E-cadherin plays an important role in epithelial cell survival, E-cadherin mutations could alter the apoptotic behavior of tumor cells. p53 and Bcl-2 family members are also important regulators of cellular apoptosis. This is the first study that investigates the relationship between E-cadherin gene mutation and p53 gene mutation, p53 accumulation, Bcl-2 expression, and Ki-67 expression in diffuse-type gastric carcinoma (24 cases, E-cadherin mutation status: wild-type in 8 patients and mutant in 16 patients). The mutation status of exons 5-8 of p53 was analyzed by denaturing high pressure liquid chromatography (DHPLC) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor sections, followed by direct sequencing of cases with aberrant chromatographic patterns. p53 mutations were found in 1 of 8 tumors without E-cadherin mutation (12.5%) and in 1 of 16 tumors with E-cadherin mutation (6.3%), a difference that was not statistically significant (p = 1.00). p53 accumulation was found in 8 of 24 tumors (33.3%) by immunohistochemical staining. p53 accumulation was significantly more frequent in tumors without E-cadherin mutations (5 of 8 tumors, 62.5%) than in gastric carcinoma tissues with E-cadherin mutations (3 of 16 tumors, 18.8%, p = 0.03). Bcl-2 staining was not observed in gastric carcinoma cells without E-cadherin mutations, but was detectable in 5 of 16 tumors with E-cadherin mutations (31.3%), a difference that was not statistically significant (p = 0.13). No relationship was observed between Ki-67 staining and the E-cadherin mutation status (p = 1.00). These data suggest that the presence of E-cadherin mutations can significantly alter the accumulation of the apoptosis-regulating p53 protein, whereas no correlation with the p53 mutation status or with Ki-67 staining was observed",

    "Title": "Analysis of chromosomal instability in pulmonary or liver metastases and matched primary hepatocellular carcinoma after orthotopic liver transplantation",
    "Abstract": "To investigate the genetic mechanism of metastatic spread in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we analyzed genomic changes in lung or liver metastases and the corresponding primary tumors (83 tumor samples) in 18 patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. We studied the incidence of microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) involving 8 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers and the polyA tract, Bat26. We also sought alterations of p53 and beta-catenin gene mutations. High MSI (&gt;30-40% of the loci analyzed) was found only in primary tumors (11%), whereas LOH was observed in 50% of primary and in 39% of recurrent tumors. p53 mutations were found in 2 cases of primary HCC but not in the corresponding metastases. P53 was overexpressed in 4 primary HCC (22%) and 7 metastases (39%). The percentage of beta-catenin gene mutations was low (6%). Lung metastases retained the D16S402 microsatellite abnormalities observed in the primary tumors, whereas recurrent liver tumor did not (p = 0.02). In conclusion, LOH and P53 protein overexpression, rather than mutations in the p53 or beta-catenin genes or MSI, seem to be involved in the spreading of HCC, suggesting the presence of metastasis suppressor genes in the vicinity of the chromosomal loci in question",

    "Abstract": "Methylation-associated inactivation of RASSF1, a putative tumor suppressor identified at 3p21.3, is reported in several cancers. We examined RASSF1 in non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) to search for clinical implications. RT-PCR analysis showed no expression of RASSF1A in 12 of 20 lung cancer cell lines. Loss of expression correlated well with promoter methylation status of these lines. Sequence analysis revealed 2 polymorphisms (codons 21 and 133) in RASSF1A transcripts, but not in RASSF1C transcripts. No somatic mutations were found. Of 7 cell lines with K-ras mutations at codon 12 or 61, 2 lost expression of RASSF1A, whereas in 13 cell lines with wild-type K-ras gene, 10 lost RASSF1A gene expression (p = 0.0521). We investigated methylation status of this putative tumor suppressor gene in 100 primary NSCLCs to determine whether there is a clinical significance. Forty-two of primary NSCLCs demonstrated methylated allele. There is no correlation between promoter methylation of RASSF1A and clinicopathological findings, including histological type or grade, tumor staging, p53 and K-ras mutational status, or patients' survival. In the cases of Stage I and II disease, however, RASSF1A methylation was associated with earlier recurrence (p = 0.0247). Epigenetic silencing of RASSF1A is a frequent event in non-small lung cancer and will provide novel opportunities to develop diagnosis and therapy of NSCLC",

    "Title": "Derivation and characterization of a Wilms' tumour cell line, WiT 49",
    "Abstract": "Wilms' tumour is a pediatric neoplasm exhibiting histologic features of developing kidney. Although the majority of Wilms' tumour patients are treated effectively, approximately 15% develop metastases and of these, 30% succumb to their disease. The biologic factors governing Wilms' tumour metastasis are largely unknown. Attempts at deriving representative Wilms' tumour cell lines, which could facilitate functional studies, have only been partially successful thus far. We now report on derivation and characterization of a Wilms' tumour cell line, WiT 49, from a first-generation xenograft of a human Wilms' tumour lung metastasis. WiT 49 recapitulates the phenotype of the parent tumours (primary and lung metastasis) and expresses normal WT1, overexpresses IGFII and carries a frequently identified p53 mutation. We recently reported overexpression of hepatocyte growth factor(HGF) and its receptor met in a series of Wilms' tumours with higher levels in homotypic metastatic cases. We therefore examined WiT 49 for expression of HGF/met and for met signaling targets associated with cell adhesion and cytoplasmic mediators of transcription using Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence labeling and zymography. Our results show co-expression of HGF and met protein, absence of E-cadherin, high levels of beta-catenin co-immunolocalized to met at the cell membrane and moderate levels of gamma-catenin and ezrin protein expression. After cell fractionation, beta-catenin was detected in the cytoplasm and nuclei of WiT 49 with relatively higher levels in the cytoplasm as compared to nuclei. Examination of MMP expression in WiT 49 showed constitutive activation of MMP 9 and latent MMP 2 supporting possible beta-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation. The WiT 49 cell line responded to recombinant human HGF by an increase in the expression of the met receptor, recruitment of the Gab-1 adapter protein to met and release of bound beta-catenin from met. Our studies therefore establish WiT 49 as a representative Wilms' tumour cell line derived from a lung metastasis that co-expresses HGF/met and shows absence of the cadherin-catenin complex supporting a role for these factors in regulation of the invasive and metastatic phenotype in Wilms' tumour",

    "Abstract": "Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach is a highly malignant neoplasm. Most gastric hepatoid adenocarcinomas coexist with tubular adenocarcinoma. However, the relationship between hepatoid adenocarcinoma and tubular adenocarcinoma is still unclear. In the present study, the characteristics of the coexistent tubular adenocarcinomas were determined by examining their profiles of mucin production. Subsequently, molecular pathological techniques were applied to determine the clonality of 15 mixed hepatoid and tubular adenocarcinomas of the stomach. Mucin analysis suggested that the coexistent tubular adenocarcinomas with hepatoid adenocarcinoma were of the intestinal type. The patterns of chromosome X inactivation were identical between the hepatoid adenocarcinoma component and tubular adenocarcinoma component in all of 3 informative female cases. Mutations in the p53 gene were found in 5 cases. The sequences were identical within both tumor components in all 5 cases. Microsatellite analysis indicated more than 3 common patterns of loss of heterozygosity in 8 cases. These observations strongly suggested that hepatoid adenocarcinomas were of identical origin to coexistent tubular adenocarcinomas",

    "Title": "TP53, p14ARF, p16INK4a and H-ras gene molecular analysis in intestinal-type adenocarcinoma of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses",
    "Abstract": "Intestinal-type adenocarcinoma (ITAC) of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses is an uncommon tumor associated with occupational exposure to dusts of different origin. Few investigations addressed molecular alterations in ITAC mainly focused on TP53, K-ras and H-ras gene mutations. The occurrence of TP53, p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) deregulation and H-ras mutations was investigated in 21 consecutive and untreated ITACs cases, 17 with known professional exposure. No H-ras mutations were found. In patients with known exposure, cumulative evidence of TP53 or p14(ARF) alterations accounted for 88% and the evidence of p16(INK4a) alterations for 65%, respectively. TP53 mutations were present in 44% of the ITACs, consisted of G:C--&gt;A:T transitions in 86%, and involved the CpG dinucleotides in 50% of the cases. LOH at the locus 17p13 and an uncommon high rate of p53 stabilization were detected in 58% and 59% of the cases, respectively. p14(ARF)and p16(INK4a) promoter methylation accounted for 80% and 67% respectively, and LOH at the locus 9p21 occurred in 45% of the cases. Interestingly, all dust-exposed tumors with p16(INK4a) alterations shared TP53 or p14(ARF) deregulation. The present results show a close association of this occupational tumor with TP53, p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) gene deregulation. Given the important role that these genes play in cell growth control and apoptosis, the knowledge of ITAC genetic profile may be helpful in selecting more tailored treatments",

    "Title": "A unique occurrence of a cerebral atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor in an infant and a spinal canal primitive neuroectodermal tumor in her father",
    "Abstract": "This report describes the clinical, pathological, immunohistochemical and genetic data of two rare malignant neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS)--a cerebral atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) in a 5-month-old girl and a spinal canal primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) in her father. Despite aggressive treatment, both tumors were fatal, displaying extensive local recurrence and diffuse neoplastic dissemination. The paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were analyzed using a dual-color FISH with a locus specific LSI22q (BCR) probe. In the AT/RT tissue, a loss of BCR locus was observed in a significant proportion of the cells in contrast to the PNET specimen where the majority of nuclei did not reveal any loss of the BCR region. No mutations in exon 5 and no changes in SNP of intron 5 of hSNF/INI1 gene were found. In addition, analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was performed using a panel of 15 microsatellite markers of chromosome 22. No LOH were found in both tumor tissues. In both cases no constitutional mutations of gene TP53 were found. Analysis of the TP53 mutations in the tumor tissues revealed that the PNET, not the AT/RT tumor, was homozygous for a missense mutation at codon 175 (CGC ==&gt; CAC). Thus, our findings emphasize the genetic differences between the two specimens and suggest that the occurrence of these two aggressive tumors of CNS in one family could be coincidental",

    "Title": "TP53 is frequently altered by methylation, mutation, and/or deletion in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia",
    "Abstract": "Different mechanisms, such as chromosomal rearrangements, deletions, mutations, and methylation/demethylation of the promoter regions of genes, have been shown to be involved in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). These genetic and epigenetic alterations lead to the activation of protooncogenes or to inactivation of tumour suppressor genes promoting cell proliferation. One of the most frequently inactivated tumour suppressor genes is TP53, which is altered in 50% of human tumours. In this study, we have analysed: (1) the complete coding region, all intron-exon junctions and noncoding regions of exons 1-11 of TP53 by lexon-DGGE; (2) the methylation status of the 5' region of TP53 and (3) the deletion of one or both alleles of the gene by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) in 57 ALL patients. Using these techniques, we have found promoter methylation in 32% of the cases, missense mutations in 8.8%, and deletion of one allele in 7.5% of the samples, with TP53 being altered in 40% of the ALL samples studied in this series",

    "Title": "Genetic analysis of a multifocal glioblastoma multiforme: a suitable tool to gain new aspects in glioma development",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Multifocal glioblastomas constitute an increasingly diagnosed subgroup of glioblastoma multiforme, the most malignant primary brain tumor in adults. The molecular background of these lesions is unknown. However, the ability to study multiple lesions of one patient simultaneously could provide new aspects in glioma development. METHODS: Short-term cell cultures were derived from three isolated glioblastoma lesions of one patient. Spectral karyotyping and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization were used for cytogenetic analysis. Loss of heterozygosity was assessed in tumor tissues and cell lines for seven gene loci (p73, p21, p16, PTEN, p27, Rb, p53). In addition, sequence analysis of the PTEN and p53 loci was performed, epidermal growth factor receptor protein expression was assessed, and in vitro proliferation was assayed. RESULTS: A balanced translocation [t(1;15)(p3?6;q2?5)] that has not been described previously in glioblastomas was identified in all cell lines. Primarily, the cell lines have a homozygous deletion of the p16 locus and inactivation of the PTEN gene by loss of heterozygosity and an identical mutation in common. Furthermore, the cell lines harbor a hemizygous (R175H) or two heterozygous (R175H, R213Q) mutations of the p53 gene or none at all. The occurrence of p53 mutations correlates with the size of the original tumors and in vitro proliferation. CONCLUSION: The analysis of a multifocal glioma revealed three main aspects: 1) the combined cytogenetic and molecular analysis of this subgroup of glioblastoma multiforme is a suitable tool to gain new perspectives in glioma development, 2) the balanced translocation [t(1;15)(p3?6;q2?5)] might harbor a new genetic marker involved in glioma development, and 3) the pattern of p53 mutation suggests a role of p53 in the progression of malignancy, migration, and growth of this particular primary glioblastoma",

    "Title": "Point mutation of TP53 suppressor gene in pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions of the stomach",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the current model for the development of gastric cancer, regions of multifocal atrophic gastritis give rise to intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and finally, adenocarcinoma. AIM: To study the frequency and characteristics of TP53 gene mutations in preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions of the stomach. MATERIAL AND METHODS: DNA sequencing of the TP53 gene was performed in 46 patients with gastric carcinoma. Normal mucosa, intestinal metaplasia and invasive adenocarcinoma tissues were obtained by scraping 6-micron histological sections from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue. RESULTS: DNA sequencing of exons 5-9 of the TP53 gene demonstrated a mutation in 31% of patients. These findings were seen both in tumoral tissue (13 cases) and in intestinal metaplasia (2 cases). Most mutations were found in exons 5 and 8, and the majority of them were transitions (10 out of 19 mutations). DISCUSSION: Patients with gastric cancer showed a frequency of TP53 mutations similar to that previously communicated in populations with low gastric cancer risk. Moreover, there was a predominance of transitions, genetic alterations that are identified with carcinogenesis associated with N-nitrosamine compounds. Finally, mutations of TP53 gene were detected in areas of intestinal metaplasia",

    "Title": "Cowden's disease: clinical and molecular genetic findings in a patient with a novel PTEN germline mutation",
    "Abstract": "We report a 54-year-old woman with Cowden's disease (CD) who was found to carry a novel germline mutation in the PTEN gene. The mutation (c.334C--&gt;G) introduced a splice donor site within exon 5 that caused the expression of an aberrant transcript lacking 159 nucleotides corresponding to codons 112-164. Clinically, the patient showed multiple benign hamartomatous lesions of the skin, papillomatosis of the lips and oral mucosa, polyposis coli and bilateral fibrocystic disease of the breast. In addition, she developed different types of malignant neoplasms, including bilateral carcinomas of the breast and malignant melanomas of the skin. Molecular genetic analysis of a benign skin hamartoma and an invasive ductal breast carcinoma revealed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at microsatellite markers on chromosome 10 in the carcinoma but not in the hamartoma. The breast carcinoma additionally carried a somatic TP53 point mutation (c.466C--&gt;G; R156G) that was associated with LOH on 17p and nuclear p53 protein accumulation. Taken together, our findings indicate that benign hamartomas in CD may develop without loss of the second (wild-type) PTEN allele, whereas the pathogenesis of malignant tumours, such as breast carcinomas, appears to require the complete inactivation of Pten as well as further alterations such as the loss of p53-dependent growth control",

    "Abstract": "We evaluated the clinicopathologic significance of p53 gene mutations, including a comparison of DNA analysis and immunohistochemical examination, in Japanese patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, a highly aggressive cancer. Genomic DNA isolated from 76 tumors without preoperative treatment was subjected to polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Associations were sought between p53 mutations and clinicopathologic characteristics. Cases also were investigated immunohistochemically to detect abnormal p53 protein accumulation. Overexpression of p53 protein occurred in 51 cases (67.1%), while gene mutations in the examined exons were found in only 14 (18.4%). By multivariate analysis, p53 mutation predicted detection of eight or more lymph node metastases. Mutations of the p53 gene may not only participate in the initiation of esophageal cancer, but also may promote lymph node metastasis. Unlike gene mutations, p53 protein overexpression did not predict nodal metastasis extent",

    "Title": "TP53 mutations in malignant and premalignant Barrett's esophagus",
    "Abstract": "In order to improve the efficacy of endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's esophagus, markers of neoplastic progression in addition to dysplasia are required. The aim of the present study was to assess TP53 mutational analysis as a method of identifying patients with Barrett's esophagus who are at greatest risk of adenocarcinoma, for whom endoscopic surveillance is most appropriate. TP53 mutational analysis was initially performed on premalignant and malignant tissue from 30 patients undergoing esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma, and on premalignant biopsies from 48 patients participating in a Barrett's surveillance program. Surveillance patients were followed up endoscopically and histologically for a median of 5 years following TP53 assessment. Mutational analysis was performed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing. TP53 mutations were detected in 10 of 30 esophageal adenocarcinomas, and were more common in well-differentiated carcinomas. An identical TP53 mutation was detected in carcinoma and adjacent dysplasia. Two patients with premalignant Barrett's esophagus had TP53 mutations and one of these patients developed adenocarcinoma on follow up whilst the other has not yet progressed beyond metaplasia. No patient without TP53 mutation developed high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. TP53 mutations are detected in 33% of esophageal adenocarcinomas and in 4% of premalignant Barrett's esophagus in patients undergoing endoscopic surveillance. TP53 mutation can be detected before the development of high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma, and may be useful in stratifying the risk of adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett's esophagus",

    "Title": "p53 mutations and overexpression affect prognosis of ovarian endometrioid cancer but not clear cell cancer",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma (OCCA) and ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EC) are considered to be closely related to endometriosis, the mechanisms of carcinogenesis of these two malignancies and malignant transformation of endometriosis are unclear. In this study, we examined the biology of OCCA and EC by performing large-scale analysis of K-ras activation and p53 mutation and overexpression in these malignancies. The results were subsequently analyzed for correlation with the clinicopathologic data. METHODS: In the present study of OCCA and EC, we obtained clinicopathological data and analyzed frequency of mutations and overexpression of K-ras and p53. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, and target sequences were amplified in vitro by polymerase chain reaction. The DNA was analyzed for K-ras and p53 mutations by testing for single-strand conformation polymorphisms and by direct sequencing. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using p53 monoclonal antibody. Univariate analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier algorithm, and differences in survival were analyzed using the log rank test. The prognostic significance of the studied variables for survival was assessed using multivariate analysis with Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: K-ras mutation was detected in 16.2% (6/37) of OCCA patients and 3.7% (1/27) of EC patients. No evidence of p53 mutation was detected in OCCA patients, but p53 mutation was detected in 63.0% of EC patients; these findings are consistent with the results of p53 immunohistochemistry. No statistical significance was observed for K-ras mutation in OCCA or EC. In EC patients, the absence of endometriosis and p53 overexpression was associated with a poorer survival. In OCCA patients tubulocystic and papillary histotype as well as stage II correlated with a worse survival. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutation, which was found in 63% of EC tumors, is an independent prognostic factor for EC patients. However, no p53 mutation was found in OCCA tumors. K-ras mutations did not affect survival of OCCA or EC patients",

    "Abstract": "We established and characterized a c-kit positive cell line from the bone marrow of a patient with biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL). The cell line, designated TMBL-1, carried a His-175 mutant p53. The immunophenotype of the primary leukemia cells at diagnosis was cytoplasmic CD3+, CD7+, CD13+, CD33-, interleukin-7 (IL-7) receptor+ and c-kit -. However, leukemia cells in relapse and TMBL-1 cells were CD33+ and c-kit +. Immunophenotypically, TMBL-1 is a BAL cell line that coexpresses T-lymphoid and myeloid markers which fulfill the criteria of the European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Leukemia. Stem cell factor (SCF), a key regulator of hematopoiesis signaling through c-kit, enhanced the proliferation of TMBL-1 cells. Direct sequencing revealed the conversion at codon 175 of the p53 gene in the TMBL-1 cells. Primary leukemia cells in relapse also carried the same point mutation but not at diagnosis. Moreover, TMBL-1 cells are sensitive to paclitaxel, which could induce p53-independent apoptosis. The biphenotypic features and p53 mutation may be associated with progression to a more malignant type. This cell line may provide new information on the role of SCF in the overlapping area between early T-lymphoid/myeloid cells, and help in the design of new therapies targeted towards p53 mutations",

    "Abstract": "The following study was designed to investigate if mutations within the p53 gene are associated with radiation responsiveness or response to different cytotoxic drugs. Nine human lung cancer cell lines were examined (four SCLC and five NSCLC cell lines). cDNA-based sequencing of the entire p53 gene was performed. All cell lines were characterised with respect to drug-sensitivity towards eight cytotoxic drugs using the FMCA method and data from the clonogenic assay were studied to obtain information concerning radioresponsiveness. All the cell lines expressed mutations; six were missense mutations and three were deletions. A statistically significant increase in radiosensitivity was found for mutations in exon 7 (p = 0.019), compared with the other mutations localised within different exons of p53. Further statistical analyses using Fisher's two-tailed exact test confirmed that mutations in exon 7 were significantly associated with radiosensitivity, p = 0.047. No correlation concerning mutations in separate exons and response towards different chemotherapeutic agents could be found. Our results indicate that p53 mutations in exon 7 might be associated with increased radiation sensitivity in these human lung cancer cell lines, but our data should be interpreted with caution since several other explanations might exist regarding what determines the response towards radiation",

    "Title": "Inactivation of DNA repair gene O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase by promoter hypermethylation and its relation to p53 mutations in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "The development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has been linked to exposure to carcinogens such as nitrosamines that cause various alkyl DNA damages and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a primary defence against alkylation-induced mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. This study was to investigate the role of inactivation of MGMT by promoter hypermethylation and its relation to p53 mutations in ESCC. Methylation of MGMT promoter was determined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in 119 ESCC specimens, 22 corresponding tissue samples adjacent to the tumors, and 21 normal epithelial specimens of the esophagus. The levels of MGMT protein in ESCC with methylated or unmethylated MGMT were analyzed by quantitative immunohistochemistry. Mutations of p53 in 119 ESCC were detected by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing. We found that all 21 normal esophageal tissues had unmethylated MGMT; however, among 119 ESCC, 46 (38.7%) had hypermethylated MGMT. This epigenetic change also occurred in some normal tissues adjacent to the tumors. The level of MGMT protein in MGMT-methylated ESCC was significantly lower than that in MGMT-unmethylated ESCC, whereas great inter-individual variation and poor expression was also observed among MGMT-unmethylated ESCC. Fifty-one percent (61/119) ESCC showed p53 mutations but the distribution of the mutations did not differ significantly between MGMT-methylated ESCC (44%) and MGMT-unmethylated ESCC (56.2%; P = 0.18). MGMT promoter hypermethylation was neither associated with overall G:C to A:T mutations nor associated with this type of mutations in non-CpG dinucleotides in p53. Our results demonstrate that inactivation of MGMT by aberrant promoter methylation is a frequent molecular event in ESCC. This epigenetic alteration is an important, but may not be the sole, mechanism leading to the impaired expression of MGMT. Aberrant MGMT methylation seemed not to be associated with overall frequency and spectrum of p53 mutations in ESCC",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The TP53 gene encodes a nuclear protein implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis. TP53 mutations and other alterations have been described in numerous types of tumors, and some of these have been associated with poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to characterize TP53 mutations in childhood B non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, their correlation with clinical prognostic factors and response to therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples from 49 children with B non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were examined for TP53 alterations by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) of exons 5-9, direct sequencing and by p53 immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Mutations of TP53 were detected in 11 of 49 (22.5%) patients and more specifically in 20% of Burkitt's lymphoma. The sequence analysis showed missense mutations in 10 cases and an insertion mutation in one case. Mutations of the transition type occurred more frequently than transversions (seven of 11). Analysis of the spectrum of single-nucleotide substitutions showed a 30% frequency of transition mutations in CpG dinucleotide sequences. The overall frequency of p53 immunostaining positivity was 36% (15 of 41). There was a very good agreement between protein expression and the presence of TP53 mutation (P=0.0005). No significant correlation was found regarding age, gender, clinical stage and LDH level and TP53 mutations. Comparison of EFS curves using the log-rank test were also not significant. However, the analysis of the effects of mutations on the core p53 structure identified biological and biochemical mutants with phenotypes probably related to different response to chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that some types of mutants can alter the protein distinctly and may be associated with a more aggressive phenotype. In addition, the impact of TP53 mutations on response to therapy may also be influenced by disruption of other genes",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endocrine cell carcinoma of the stomach is characterized by endocrine differentiation and aggressive biological behavior, and is frequently accompanied by an adenocarcinoma component. Because the carcinogenic parthway and genetic alterations remain unclear, we investigated the histogenesis of the tumor by histopathological and p53 gene analysis. METHODS: The materials were 68 gastric endocrine cell carcinomas and 30 carcinoid tumors, which were resected from 93 Japanese patients for histopathological and immunohistochemical investigation. We also analyzed the concordance of p53 mutational status between the associated adenocarcinoma and endocrine cell carcinoma components, using microdissection and direct sequencing techniques. RESULTS: An adenocarcinoma component was associated with 70.6% (48/68) of endocrine cell carcinomas, of which 42 (87.5%) were of well- to moderately differentiated type, while 36 of these 42 (85.7%) demonstrated histological continuity with the endocrine cell carcinoma components. Overexpression of p53 protein was observed in 58.8% (20/34) of cases. Common p53 mutational status between the two components was revealed in 73.3% (11/15) of cases analyzed. In contrast, carcinoid tumors did not exhibit p53 protein overexpression (0/15) or gene mutation (0/5). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that gastric endocrine cell carcinomas predominantly arise from endocrine precursor cell clones occurring in preceding adenocarcinoma components (particularly the differentiated type), transforming into endocrine cell carcinoma during rapid clonal expansion under the influence of p53 gene alteration.Endocrine cell carcinoma of the stomach is characterized by endocrine differentiation and aggressive biological behavior, and is frequently accompanied by an adenocarcinoma component. Because the carcinogenic pathway and genetic alterations remain unclear, we investigated the histogenesis of this tumor by histopathological and p53 gene analysis",

    "Abstract": "AIMS: The pathogenic mechanism and predictive indicators of biological behaviour of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour are poorly understood. We investigated molecular abnormalities of p53 and MDM2 in order to assess whether these play an important role in pathogenesis, and whether they also contribute to clinicopathological aggressive phenotype in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the immunohistochemical expression of calponin, h-caldesmon, ALK, and p53 gene mutation and MDM2 gene amplification with clinicopathological findings in 15 cases of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour. Histologically, cellular atypia was observed in five (33.3%) out of 15 cases. Local recurrences were observed in two (14.3%) of 14 informative cases, but no distant metastasis was observed. The expression of calponin (9/14; 64%) but not h-caldesmon (0/14; 0%) was seen, which suggested myofibroblastic differentiation. ALK expression was seen in eight (53.3%) out of 15 cases, particularly in patients under 40 years old. Nuclear expression of p53 protein was recognized in only one (6.7%) of 15 cases, and polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism followed by direct sequencing revealed p53 gene missense mutations in two (13.3%) of 15 cases. Nuclear expression of MDM2 was seen in four (26.7%) of 15 cases, and the MDM2 gene amplification was observed in two of the four cases. CONCLUSION: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour shows a wide spectrum of cellular atypia and biological behaviour with p53 and MDM2 expression. However, the alterations in the p53 pathway seem not to play a major role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Although survival with a p53 missense mutation is highly variable, p53-null mutation is an independent adverse prognostic factor for advanced stage ovarian cancer. By evaluating ovarian cancer survival based upon a structure function analysis of the p53 protein, we tested the hypothesis that not all missense mutations are equivalent. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The p53 gene was sequenced from 267 consecutive ovarian cancers. The effect of individual missense mutations on p53 structure was analyzed using the International Agency for Research on Cancer p53 Mutational Database, which specifies the effects of p53 mutations on p53 core domain structure. Mutations in the p53 core domain were classified as either explained or not explained in structural or functional terms by their predicted effects on protein folding, protein-DNA contacts, or mutation in highly conserved residues. Null mutations were classified by their mechanism of origin. RESULTS: Mutations were sequenced from 125 tumors. Effects of 62 of the 82 missense mutations (76%) could be explained by alterations in the p53 protein. Twenty-three (28%) of the explained mutations occurred in highly conserved regions of the p53 core protein. Twenty-two nonsense point mutations and 21 frameshift null mutations were sequenced. Survival was independent of missense mutation type and mechanism of null mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that not all missense mutations are equivalent is, therefore, rejected. Furthermore, p53 core domain structural alteration secondary to missense point mutation is not functionally equivalent to a p53-null mutation. The poor prognosis associated with p53-null mutation is independent of the mutation mechanism",

    "Title": "Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, p53 Mutation, and Pathological Response Predict Survival in Patients with Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer Treated with Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite the availability of cellular markers associated with cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair, predictive factors for pathological complete response (CR) and overall survival (OS) are few in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. This study evaluates the role of clinical and cellular markers in predicting CR and OS in patients with esophageal cancer. Experimental Design: Patients were treated with infusional cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil combined with daily radiotherapy followed by esophagectomy. Pretreatment tumors (n = 54) were analyzed for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), bax, and bcl-2 expression by immunohistochemistry and for p53 mutations by direct DNA sequencing of exons 5-8. Clinical covariates included patients' age at enrollment; gender; Barrett's metaplasia; and tumor location, histology, and differentiation. Logistic regression and survival analyses were used to evaluate the predictors. RESULTS: Age ranged from 32 to 75 years; most patients were male (45 male; 9 female); and tumors were distal (47 distal; 7 mid), adenocarcinoma (41 adenocarcinomas; 13 squamous cell carcinomas), and moderately differentiated (33 moderate; 6 well; 15 poor). Female gender predicted CR (odds ratio 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-41). The OS was 43% at 5 years. Presence of CR (P &lt; 0.001 log rank) and p53 mutation (P = 0.051 log rank) correlated with increased OS, whereas increased EGF-R expression predicted poor OS (P = 0.009 log rank). EGF-R remained significant when adjusted for clinical covariates. There was a trend toward increased OS related to better tumor differentiation and decreased bcl-2. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that EGF-R and p53 mutation may be used as both outcome predictors and targets for molecular therapy for esophageal cancer",

    "Title": "TP53 gene mutations predict the response to neoadjuvant treatment with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin in locally advanced breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Recent studies have found an association between certain TP53 mutations and resistance to anthracycline-based primary medical therapy in breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether TP53 mutational status also might influence the response to a non-anthracycline-containing regimen in primary breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty-five patients with locally advanced breast cancer were investigated for TP53 mutations before receiving combination chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2) and mitomycin (6 mg/m(2) on day 2), administered every 3 weeks for 2-10 cycles in the neoadjuvant setting. RESULTS: Mutations in the TP53 gene, in particular those affecting loop domains L2 or L3 of the p53 protein, were associated with lack of response to chemotherapy (i.e., increase in the diameter product of tumor lesion by &gt;/=25%; P = 0.177 for all mutations and P = 0.006 for those affecting L2/L3 domains, respectively). No statistically significant correlation between TP53 LOH and response to therapy was seen. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a significant association between lack of response to 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin and mutations affecting the L2/L3 domains of the p53 protein. Together with our previous finding that such mutations predict resistance to weekly doxorubicin, our data suggest that mutations affecting this particular domain of the p53 protein may cause resistance to several different cytotoxic compounds applied in breast cancer treatment",

    "Title": "Distinct K-ras mutation pattern characterizes signet ring cell colorectal carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Signet ring cell colorectal carcinoma (SRCCC) represents a unique, infrequent, and highly malignant variant of colorectal cancer. To understand the pathogenesis of SRCCC, we investigated its molecular abnormalities and compared them with those of the usual type of colorectal adenocarcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Microdissected archival paraffin-embedded tissue from 16 SRCCCs and 27 non-SRCCCs was used to determine the frequency and pattern of mutation at codons 12, 13, and 61 of K-ras. A subset of tumors was examined for TP53 mutations at exons 5-8 and allele loss and genetic instability using seven microsatellite and two mononucleotide markers. RESULTS: Comparable data on TP53 mutation, allele loss, and microsatellite instability were found between SRCCC and non-SRCCC. However, SRCCCs demonstrated a distinct pattern of K-ras mutation with a significantly lower frequency of mutations at codons 12 and 13 (13% versus 48%, P = 0.02) as compared with the non-SRCCCs. Four cases (25%) of SRCCC demonstrated the same A:T transversion at the third base position of K-ras codon 61 (CAA to CAT; Gln to His). No such point mutation was detected in non-SRCCCs or in the 30 gastric and 4 urinary bladder signet ring cell carcinomas examined. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a distinct pattern of K-ras mutation is present in SRCCC, including a specific codon 61 mutation that has rarely been reported in human neoplasms",

    "Title": "Chromosomal instability rather than p53 mutation is associated with response to neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy in gastric carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to evaluate microsatellite alterations [microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH)] and mutation in the p53 gene in relation to response and patient survival to a cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in gastric cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fifty-three pretherapeutic gastric carcinoma biopsies were analyzed with 11 microsatellite markers. The entire coding region of the p53 gene (exons 2-11) was analyzed for mutations by denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography and sequencing. p53 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Patients were treated with a cisplatin-based, neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Therapy response was evaluated by computed tomography scan, endoscopy, and endoluminal ultrasound. The median follow-up of the patients was 45.6 months. RESULTS: p53 mutations were identified in 19 of the 53 (36%) analyzed tumors. No significant association with response or survival was found for p53 mutation or for p53 protein expression. MSI (either high-grade MSI or low-grade MSI) did not show a correlation with response. With respect to LOH, LOH at chromosome 17p13 showed a significant association with therapy response (P = 0.022) but did not reach statistical significance in terms of patient survival. The global LOH rate, expressed as fractional allelic loss (FAL), was assessed, and tumors were classified into tumors with a high (&gt;0.5), medium (&gt;0.25-0.5), and low (0-0.25) FAL value. A statistically significant association of FAL with therapy response was found (P = 0.003), with a high FAL being related to therapy response. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for FAL &gt; 0.5 were 45%, 93%, 82%, and 72%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A high level of chromosomal instability (high FAL value) defines a subset of patients who are more likely to benefit from cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. p53 mutation status is not significantly associated with therapy response and is not a useful marker for response prediction",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The expression pattern of PAX5 in the tissue of superficial bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), its prognostic value and its correlation with p53 immunohistochemistry and p53 mutation analysis were evaluated. METHODS: Study comprised 61 patients with histologically confirmed superficial bladder TCC. Expression level of PAX5 mRNA was investigated using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and determined semiquantitatively. The presence of p53 mutations was determined by SSCP and confirmed by direct sequencing. The p53 immunohistochemistry was performed with DO1 antibody and semiquantitatively evaluated using HSCORE (HS) method. As the control group for the evaluation of the PAX5 expression served 8 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. RESULTS: PAX5 expression was found in 50 patients with bladder TCC but in no patient from the control group. Its quantity however correlated neither with the stage nor with the grade of the tumor. P53 mutation was confirmed only in 1 patient with pTaG2 tumor in exon 5 (deletion of proline 128). On the contrary, positive immunohistochemical staining of p53 was detected in most patients. Using the cutoff value of HS 200, 56.9% of patients showed p53 overexpression. Quantity of p53 immunochistochemical positivity did not correlate with the quantity of PAX5 expression. Using the cutoff values of HS 200 for p53 and of 0.2 for PAX5, 7 of 8 patients with future progression had p53 and 4 had PAX5 overexpression respectively. CONCLUSION: The expression of gene PAX5 is a frequent event in superficial TCC of the bladder",

    "Title": "Geographic characterization of hepatitis virus infections, genotyping of hepatitis B virus, and p53 mutation in hepatocellular carcinoma analyzed by in situ detection of viral genomes from carcinoma tissues: comparison among six different countries",
    "Abstract": "We investigated the relationship of infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) to p53 mutation in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) from six countries, including Japan, China, Korea, Vietnam, Spain, and the Unites States. For this purpose, we used formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver tissues obtained from 449 patients with HCC to detect the viral and p53 genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HBV was the most prevalent in Korea (69.1%), China (66.1%), Vietnam (60.5%), and Spain (38.6%). In contrast, HCV was the most prevalent in Japan (59.8%) and in the United States (41.5%). Type C of HBV was the most common genotype (78.6%) encountered in HCC in these countries. Importantly, among 125 intrahepatic HBV DNA-positive patients, 44 (35.2%) were serologically negative for HBsAg (occult hepatitis B). Based on PCR, immunohistochemical, serological, and clinical findings, 4.8% of HCC patients were diagnosed with non-B, non-C. A point mutation at exon 7 of p53 was detected in 20 of the 239 HCC samples examined, including those from 9 Chinese, 5 American, 2 Japanese, 2 Korean, and 2 Spanish patients, respectively. Interestingly, a point mutation with an amino acid substitution at codon 251 (Ile--&gt;Asn) was detected frequently in 11 of 20 (55%) cases. A specific mutation induced by Aflatoxin B1 at codon 249 was seen in two patients, both Chinese. Our results suggest that genotype C of HBV may play an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis in different geographic regions, and that in situ detection of HBV genomes could be important for clarifying the agent(s) of unknown etiology related to HCC",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of p53 are rare in primary and advanced neuroblastomas. The p53 gene was studied in a TGW cell line established from a TNB1 xenograft, derived from metastasized neuroblastoma. The p53 protein level in TGW was elevated at baseline. Treatment with doxorubicin to induce genotoxic stress neither altered the p53 protein level nor induced p21 protein within 24 hours. DNA sequencing analysis revealed a novel triplet deletion mutation at codon 282 (R282del) of the p53 gene, a mutation also found in TNB1, indicating that the mutation occurred in the relapsed tumor. The mutant was incapable of transactivation and had no effect on the transactivational activity of the wild-type p53 gene product in reporter assays using a plasmid possessing a p53 responsive element of p21, bax or mdm2. These results suggest that the mutant p53R282del found in TGW is a non-functional mutant and has no dominant negative nature",

    "Abstract": "Inactivation of p53 has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis and drug resistance in malignant tumors. Nevertheless, few reports have directly shown such effects in primary tumor cells. Here, we investigated the p53 mutational status in 138 B-CLL samples and compared these findings with drug and gamma-irradiation sensitivity profiles. p53 mutations resulted not only in a shorter survival but, notably also in selective resistance to alkylating agents, fludarabine and gamma-irradiation. In contrast, no such effect was observed for vincristine, anthracyclines and glucocorticoids. Thus, these latter compounds induce cell death at least in part by p53-independent pathways. Interestingly, p53 mutations clustered in patients who had received prior chemotherapy. In fact, we show for the first time that treatment with DNA-damaging alkylating agents correlates with occurrence of p53 mutations in a clinical setting. This finding may explain at least to some extent the development of resistance to second-line anticancer chemotherapy.Cell Death and Differentiation (2003) 10, 477-484. doi:10.1038/sj.cdd.4401194",

    "Title": "p53 mutations and survival in stage I non-small-cell lung cancer: results of a prospective study",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The p53 gene is frequently mutated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, the effect of p53 gene mutations on patient prognosis remains unclear. Therefore, we initiated a prospective study to determine the association of p53 gene mutations with survival in patients with stage I NSCLC. METHODS: Tumor samples were collected prospectively from 188 patients with operable NSCLC (stages I, II, and IIIA). p53 mutations were detected by direct dideoxynucleotide sequencing and p53 GeneChip analysis. Association of clinical and pathologic variables (e.g., alcohol consumption, sex, age, pathologic stage) with mutation of the p53 gene was determined by logistic regression. Associations between p53 mutation status, clinical and pathologic variables, and survival were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: p53 mutations were detected in 55% (104/188) of tumors. These mutations were associated with non-bronchoalveolar tumors, a history of alcohol consumption, and younger patient age. The risk of death was statistically significantly higher in patients with p53 mutations in their tumors (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0 to 2.4; P =.049) than in patients with wild-type p53 in their tumors. Tumor stage, the presence of a p53 mutation, and increasing patient age were statistically significant predictors of patient death in the entire patient group; however, the statistically significant prognostic effect of p53 mutation was limited to patients with stage I NSCLC (stage I HR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.4 to 5.6; stage II HR = 1.8, 95% CI = 0.74 to 4.4; and stage III HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.32 to 1.5). Among patients with stage I NSCLC, actuarial 4-year survival was statistically significantly higher in those with wild-type p53 than in those with mutant p53 (78% versus 52%, respectively; difference in 4-year survival = 26%, 95% CI = 6% to 46%; P =.009, log-rank test). CONCLUSION: Tumor p53 mutations are a statistically significant predictor of poor outcome in patients with stage I NSCLC",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 have been reported as occurring prevalently in a wide range of human tumors. Detection of a mutated p53 is thought to provide useful information for the clinical management of colorectal neoplasm. In this study, we used polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) and sequencing analysis to rapidly screen for mutations in p53 in colorectal cancer in Taiwan. Genomic DNA was purified from colorectal cancer specimens obtained from 80 patients at a teaching hospital in southern Taiwan. Primer sets were designed to amplify fragments within exons 4-8 of p53. We found p53 mutations in 38 of 80 patients. This is the first identification of a mutation at codon 143 of p53 in colorectal cancer in Taiwan. In addition, we found two insertions in exon 5 of p53. The p53 mutation rate among colorectal tumors in Taiwan, found in this study, is 43%. The results indicate that p53 mutation is not significantly associated with tumor grade, age, or gender (p &gt; 0.05). We found that two-fifths of colorectal cancer patients in Taiwan have a p53 mutation, which could be used as a marker of colorectal cancer",

    "Title": "Somatic mutation analysis of p53 and ST7 tumor suppressor genes in gastric carcinoma by DHPLC",
    "Abstract": "AIM: To verify the effectiveness of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) in detecting somatic mutation of p53 gene in gastric carcinoma tissues. The superiority of this method has been proved in the detection of germline mutations, but it was not very affirmative with respect to somatic mutations in tumor specimens. ST7 gene, a candidate tumor suppressor gene identified recently at human chromosome 7q31.1, was also detected because LOH at this site has also been widely reported in stomach cancer. METHODS: DNA was extracted from 39 cases of surgical gastric carcinoma specimen and their correspondent normal mucosa. Seven fragments spanning the 11 exons were used to detect the mutation of p53 gene and the four exons reported to have mutations in ST7 gene were amplified by PCR and directly analyzed by DHPLC without mixing with wild-type allele. RESULTS: In the analysis of p53 gene mutation, 9 aberrant DHPLC chromatographies were found in tumor tissues, while their normal-adjacent counterparts running in parallel showed a normal shape. Subsequent sequencing revealed nine sequence variations, 1 polymorphism and 8 mutations including 3 mutations not reported before. The mutation rate of p53 gene (21 %) was consistent with that previously reported. Furthermore, no additional aberrant chromatography was found when wild-type DNA was added into the DNA of other 30 tumor samples that showed normal shapes previously. The positivity of p53 mutations was significantly higher in intestinal-type carcinomas (40 %) than that in diffuse-type (8.33 %) carcinomas of the stomach. No mutation of ST7 gene was found. CONCLUSION: DHPLC is a very convenient method for the detection of somatic mutations in gastric carcinoma. The amount of wild type alleles supplied by the non-tumorous cells in gastric tumor specimens is enough to form heteroduplex with mutant alleles for DHPLC detection. ST7 gene may not be the target gene of inactivation at 7q31 site in gastric carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "We present a new cell line, EN, established from an invasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus in 50-year-old patient. The cells show rapid growth in culture with a doubling time of 24.4 hours and high migration activity. Monolayer-cultured cells were polygonal in shape and showed a tendency to pile up without contact inhibition. Subcutaneous transplantation of the EN cells into nude mice formed solid tumors that were histologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, whereas no metastasis was observed. Cultured EN cells produced tissue polypeptide antigen. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed high telomerase activity and estrogen receptor beta but not alpha expression. Using the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism technique, we have screened EN cells for TP53 mutation in exons 5-8. A mobility shift was observed in this cell line in exon 8. A nucleotide insertion (CGT-->CAGT) was detected at codon 273, which resulted in a creation of a stop codon at codon 308. This cell line thus appears to represent the development of a more malignant clone with divergent receptor function and growth behavior, and provides us with an interesting new tool for the study of tumorigenesis in the human endometrium",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocarcinogenesis may involve multiple mutations with distinctive pathogenetic and clinicopathologic significance. To test this hypothesis, 68 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were studied prospectively for genetic-clinicopathologic correlation. Ten pathologic characteristics were evaluated. TP53 (alias p53) gene mutation was studied by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism-sequencing; CDKN2B (alias p15) and CDKN2A (alias p16) gene methylation by methylation-specific PCR; and genetic imbalances by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). TP53 gene mutations occurred in 25% of cases, more than half being codon 249 G to T transversion. Methylation of CDKN2A was frequent (61.7%); of CDKN2B, rare (5.9%). The CGH analysis showed a median of nine aberrations per case, with amplifications more frequent than deletions. Isochromosomes might be involved in about 25% of cases. Amplifications of 1q and 8q were most frequent. Clinicopathologic correlations showed that CDKN2A methylation was significantly associated with tumors arising in cirrhotic livers; amplifications of 17q was significant in multiple parameters of tumor invasiveness (size, venous invasion, poor cellular differentiation, microsatellite formation); other amplifications (1q, 6p, 10p, and 20p) were also significant in tumor invasion; and deletions (at 1p, 11q, 4q, and 14q) were significant in tumor growth. Consistent patterns of genetic alterations were defined in HCC, which might represent distinctive pathways in hepatocarcinogenesis",

    "Abstract": "Laryngeal cancer (LC) is the sixth most common cancer in the world and the second most common respiratory cancer, with approximately 500000 new cases worldwide, annually. The mechanisms of tumorigenesis in LC remain unknown, although smoking and alcohol consumption are considered to be major risk factors. Mutations within TP53 have been strongly implicated as frequent events in several cancers. We screened exons 5-8 of TP53 for mutations in DNA from tumor biopsies (n = 44) and blood samples (n = 42) from the same LC patients, and blood samples from a healthy, matched control group (n = 40), using polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing. Significant positive correlations were found between the occurrence of LC and age and smoking, whereas daily meat consumption was a possible protective factor. In tumor-derived samples, mutations were found in three of the exons under investigation, representing 25% of the samples. The mutations were unique to the tumor biopsies, indicating a somatic origin for mutations. The data confirm that the region between codons 175 and 273 of TP53 is a mutational hotspot region for cancers in general; six novel mutations were found within this same region",

METHODS: Fifty five cases of sporadic colorectal cancer were analyzed for MI/RER by PCR-based silver staining or ABI377 sequencer at following seven separate microsatellite loci: BAT-26, D2S119, D2S123, D3S1293, D8S282, D13S160 and D18S58. p53 mutations at exon 5 - 8 were detected by direct sequencing and its overexpressions performed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: p53 gene mutations were present in 38.2% (21/55) of the tumors and its overexpressions in 60% (33/55) with a concordance rate of 42%. MI or RER positive rate was 27.2% (15/55) or 14.5% (8/55). MI/RER + cancers showed a tendency of relatively high p53 total mutation and point mutation rates with 53.3% VS 32.5% and 53.3% VS 30% in MI group (P &gt; 0.05) and with 62.5% VS 34% and 62.5% VS 30.2% (P &gt; 0.05) in RER group respectively; but they had low protein expression rate with 46.7% VS 65% in MI group and 50% VS 62% in RER group (P &gt; 0.05). There were no differences in p53 missense mutation rates and distributions at CpG sites with 40% VS 30% and 20% VS 12.5% (P &gt; 0.05) between the two kinds of MI/RER tumors. Furthermore, each (CA)n microsatellite locus had no significant effect on p53 mutation. CONCLUSION: No significant relationship is found between MI/RER and p53 mutation/overexpression in sporadic colorectal cancer. But MI/RER tumor tends to have relatively high p53 mutation and low overexpression rates. In addition, there exist no differences in p53 missense mutation rates and distributions at CpG sites between the two kinds of MI/RER tumors",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the successive steps of cervical neoplasia and to determine its correlation with angiogenesis and p53 status. STUDY DESIGN: Immunohistochemical staining with a VEGF monoclonal antibody was performed on a total of 161 cervical specimens representing 12 normal epithelium, 33 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 30 CIN 3 and 86 squamous cell carcinomas. Microvessels were immunohistochemically labeled with an antibody to CD34. Computerized image analysis was used to evaluate microvessel density (MVD). p53 Status was determined by immunohistochemistry and direct sequencing of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene. RESULTS: VEGF expression progressively increased along the continuum from normal epithelium to squamous cell carcinoma (P < .05). MVD increased significantly with cervical neoplasia progression, from normal epithelium, through CIN, to squamous cell carcinoma (P < .001). A strong correlation was observed between VEGF expression and MVD (P < .001). p53 Protein expression was not detected in the normal epithelium or in CIN 1, while 3 (10%) of 30 CIN 3 and 28 (33%) of 86 squamous cell carcinomas were positive for p53. VEGF expression correlated statistically with p53 protein expression (P < .001). In double",

    "Title": "Comparison of p53 mutational status with mRNA and protein expression in a panel of 24 human breast carcinoma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "We analyzed the p53 mutational status, mRNA and protein expression in 24 human breast carcinoma cell lines. Following measurement of their DNA content with flow cytometry, we ascertained the copy numbers of the centromere of chromosome 17 (cen17) and p53 with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). A functional yeast assay (FASAY) was used to screen for inactivating mutations. Positive results were subsequently verified by DNA sequencing. Finally, we assessed the mRNA expression with a competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and the protein expression with immunocytochemical staining, western blot, and quantitative flow cytometry. The DNA content of the cell lines ranged from 0.85 to 2.58. Nine cell lines had concordant copy numbers (between two and four) of p53 and cen17, whereas 12 had more, and three less cen17 than p53 copies. The FASAY was successful in all but one cell line and revealed the presence of mutated alleles in 16 of them, 13 cell lines expressed only the mutated, and three both the mutated and the wild-type alleles. The mutations were comprised of 11 missense, two nonsense, and three frameshift mutations. Immunocytochemical staining, western blot and quantitative flow cytometry yielded comparable p53 protein expression results. However, both the mRNA and the protein expression levels varied considerably in the different cell lines and no consistent pattern with regard to the respective p53 mutational status became evident. The results obtained in these breast carcinoma cell lines indicate that no clear-cut linear relationship exists between the p53 mutational status and the extent of its respective mRNA and protein expression. Therefore, direct DNA analyses and functional assays remain the only methods for the reliable detection of p53 mutations",

    "Title": "Overexpression of cyclin A overrides the effect of p53 alterations in breast cancer patients with long follow-up time",
    "Abstract": "The tumour suppressor gene p53 and its protein controls critical cellular functions in cell cycle regulation as well as in apoptosis. Recently, in an in vitro study on breast cancer cell line MCF-7, the apoptotic function of p53 has been shown to be altered by overexpression of cyclin A. In this study we have demonstrated a similar association in a consecutive series of 166 breast cancer patients operated for invasive breast carcinomas. We detected mutations (exon 5-8) in the tumour tissue from 28 (16.0%) of the patients, and positive immunoreactivity of p53 protein was detected in tumour tissue samples from 32 (18.8%) patients. A statistically significant correlation between TP53 gene mutations and positive immunohistochemistry of p53 protein was observed (p = 0.0038). Mutations of the TP53 gene, as well as positive immunoreactivity to p53, were associated with poor prognosis (mutations p = 0.053, HR = 1.8, 95% CI 0.99-3.4; positive immunoreactivity p = 0.029, HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.0-1.7; mutation and/or positive immunoreactivity p = 0.015, HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.7) when cyclin A was not included in the survival analysis. However, when cyclin A overexpression was included, alteration of the p53 protein (mutations and/or positive immunoreactivity) lost its statistical power (p = 0.088). In a stratified survival analysis the OR fell from 3.0 (95% CI 1.2-8.3, p = 0.03) in the low-expression cyclin A stratum to 1.3 (95% CI 0.42-4.1, p = 0.77) in the overexpression cyclin A stratum",

    "Title": "Analysis of TP53 and PTEN in gliomatosis cerebri",
    "Abstract": "Gliomatosis cerebri (GC) is a rare glial neoplasm with extensive diffuse brain infiltration but relative preservation of the underlying architecture. Previous molecular studies, mostly analyzing biopsy samples, have suggested an astrocytic origin of GC, but a larger collective of autopsy tissue has not been investigated so far. Furthermore, whether the widespread neoplastic infiltration is based on a monoclonal process is still a matter of debate. In the present study, we screened paraffin-embedded brain tissue from different areas of 18 cases (8 autopsy cases and 10 biopsies) for alterations in the TP53 and PTEN genes. Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein was detected in 9 cases (50%). Somatic TP53 mutations occurred in two autopsy cases (11% of all cases). In the first case, a C--&gt;T transition in codon 273 (Arg--&gt;Cys) was detected in all tumor samples. In the second case, in tumor samples from one hemisphere, nuclear accumulation of p53 was caused by a G--&gt;A transition in codon 244 (Gly--&gt;Asp). In the present series, no mutations within the coding region of PTEN were found. Pten expression was observed in two autopsy cases (25%) and seven biopsy samples (70%). These data suggest that TP53 is affected in some cases, but other yet-unidentified genetic alterations might contribute to tumorigenesis in GC. Furthermore, although GC might be a monoclonal process, the presence of different tumor clones cannot be ruled out",

    "Title": "Near-diploid and near-triploid human sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas differ for KRAS2 and TP53 mutational status",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the KRAS2 protoncogene and inactivation of the TP53 oncosuppressor gene have been suggested to contribute to chromosomal instability (CIN) and aneuploidy in colorectal cancer (CRC). Previous work has also shown that the degree of DNA ploidy [DNA index (DI)], as obtained by flow cytometry in CRC, is non-randomly distributed and, in particular, that DI near-diploid and near-triploid values are well separated by a low-probability valley region. At present, it is not known whether a relationship exists between DI and the mutational status of KRAS2 and TP53. Multiple samples obtained from 35 human sporadic CRCs have been used to provide nuclei suspensions for flow cytometric analysis and sorting of specific DI subpopulations. Sorted nuclei were then used to analyze the high-microsatellite-instability (MSI-H) phenotype and the mutation spectrum of the KRAS2 and TP53 genes. A single MSI-H case was detected. There were 6 DNA diploid (DI = 1) and 29 aneuploid (DI not equal 1) CRCs, with the DI aneuploid cases non-randomly subdivided in 9 near-diploid (DI not equal 1 and DI &lt;/= 1.4), 8 near-triploid (1.4 &lt; DI &lt; 1.6), and 12 high-aneuploid (DI &gt;/= 1.6) cases. Proximal CRCs were more often DNA diploid and near-diploid than distal ones, and Dukes' C cases were more commonly high-aneuploid than Dukes' B. Moreover, the incidence of mutations of the KRAS2 and TP53 genes was lowest among the DNA near-triploid subpopulations and highest among the near-diploid ones. We suggest that DNA near-diploid and near-triploid subpopulations in human sporadic CRC reflect different genetic mechanisms of CIN and have a potentially different clinical behavior",

    "Title": "Clinical implications of p53 tumor suppressor gene mutation and protein expression in esophageal adenocarcinomas: Results of a ten-year prospective study",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to characterize the spectrum of p53 alterations (mutations and protein expression) in surgically resected esophageal adenocarcinomas, and to correlate molecular alterations with clinicopathologic findings and outcome. METHODS: Between 1991 and 2001, 91 consecutive patients with esophageal adenocarcinomas underwent subtotal esophagectomy. No patient received induction therapy. Strict clinicopathologic criteria were used to define primary esophageal adenocarcinomas. Genomic DNA was extracted from esophageal tumors, each matched with histologically normal esophageal epithelium (internal control) from the resection margin. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify p53 exons 4 through 10. Mutations were studied by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing. Immunohistochemical testing (monoclonal antibody DO7) was used to evaluate p53 protein distribution. RESULTS: Five-year overall survival was 27.3%. No p53 alterations (mutations and/or protein overexpression) were found in normal esophageal epithelium. A total of 57.1% (n = 52) of tumors had p53 alterations (mutations and/or protein overexpression), which on univariate analysis were associated with poor tumor differentiation (P =.001), advanced pTNM stage (P =.009), and number of involved lymph nodes (0, 1-3, &gt;3; P =.04). Patients with p53 alterations had significantly reduced 5-year overall survival relative to patients with wild-type p53 (15% vs 46%; P =.004). The p53 mutations were predominantly G:C to A:T transitions at CpG dinucleotides (52.2%, 24/46) CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that p53 alterations (mutations and/or protein overexpression) are a predictor of reduced postoperative survival after surgical resection of esophageal adenocarcinomas and that p53 may be a clinically useful molecular marker for stratifying patients in future clinical trials. Patterns of p53 mutations suggest endogenous mutational mechanisms",

    "Title": "The presence of p53 mutations in human osteosarcomas correlates with high levels of genomic instability",
    "Abstract": "The p53 gene is a critical tumor suppressor that is inactivated in a majority of cancers. The central role of p53 in response to stresses such as DNA damage, hypoxia, and oncogene activation underlies this high frequency of negative selection during tumorigenic transformation. Mutations in p53 disrupt checkpoint responses to DNA damage and result in the potential for destabilization of the genome. Consistent with this, p53 mutant cells have been shown to accumulate genomic alterations in cell culture, mouse models, and some human tumors. The relationship between p53 mutation and genomic instability in human osteosarcoma is addressed in this report. Similar to some other primary human tumors, the mutation of p53 correlates significantly with the presence of high levels of genomic instability in osteosarcomas. Surprisingly, osteosarcomas harboring an amplification of the HDM2 oncogene, which inhibits the tumor-suppressive properties of p53, do not display high levels of genomic instability. These results demonstrate that the inactivation of p53 in osteosarcomas directly by mutation versus indirectly by HDM2 amplification may have different cellular consequences with respect to the stability of the genome",

    "Title": "Inhibition of mutant p53 expression and growth of DMS-153 small cell lung carcinoma by antagonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone and bombesin",
    "Abstract": "We investigated the effects of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) antagonists, JV-1-65 and JV-1-63, and bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide (BN/GRP) antagonist RC-3940-II on DMS-153 human small cell lung carcinoma xenografted into nude mice. Treatment with 10 microg/day JV-1-65 or RC-3940-II decreased tumor volume by 28% (P &lt; 0.05) and 77% (P &lt; 0.01), respectively, after 42 days compared with controls. Combination of JV-1-65 and RC-3940-II induced the greatest inhibition of tumor proliferation (95%; P &lt; 0.01), suggesting a synergism. Western blotting showed that the antitumor effects of these antagonists were associated with inhibition of the expression of the mutant tumor suppressor protein p53 (Tp53). Mutation was detected by sequence analysis of the p53 gene at codon 155: ACC [Thr] --&gt; CCC [Pro]. Combination of JV-1-65 and RC-3940-II decreased the levels of mutant p53 protein by 42% (P &lt; 0.01) compared with controls. JV-1-65, JV-1-63, and RC-3940-II, given singly, reduced mutant p53 protein expression by 18-24% (P &lt; 0.05). Serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I levels were diminished in animals receiving GHRH antagonists. mRNA levels for IGF-II, IGF receptor-I, GRP receptor, and EGF receptor in tumors were significantly decreased by combined treatment with JV-1-65 and RC-3940-II. DMS-153 tumors expressed mRNAs for GHRH and GHRH receptor splice variants 1 and 2, suggesting that GHRH could be an autocrine growth factor. Proliferation of DMS-153 cells in vitro was stimulated by GRP and IGF-II and inhibited by JV-1-65. This study indicates that GHRH antagonists and BN/GRP antagonist inhibit the growth of DMS-153 small cell lung carcinoma concomitantly with the expression of mutant Tp53, which might uncouple the signal transduction pathways for cell growth stimulation",

    "Title": "Lack of p53 Nuclear Immunostaining Is Not Indicative of Absence of TP53 Gene Mutations in Colorectal Adenocarcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Multiple studies using primary tumors have reported that alterations in p53 expression and detection of TP53 mutations are associated with clinical aggressiveness and poor response to specific therapies. However, there is no general agreement regarding the optimal technical approach to the analysis of p53. We have studied a series of 100 primary colorectal adenocarcinomas by immunohistochemistry with the monoclonal antibody PAb1801, and single-stranded conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP, exons 4-8) followed by direct sequencing of shifted bands. p53 Nuclear staining was undetectable (score 0) in 29 of 100 cases. However, gene mutations were detected in 15 of these cases, with all of these mutations leading to abnormal proteins. p53 Nuclear staining was detectable and scored as less than 10% tumor cells positive in 15 of 100 cases but was still considered to be displaying a p53-negative phenotype because the cut-off value for positivity was 10% positive tumor cells. Nevertheless, TP53 gene mutations were detected in 2 of these cases. p53 Nuclear immunoreactivities were detectable and scored as more than 10% tumor cells positive in 56 cases, considered the p53-positive phenotype. TP53 gene mutations were identified in 51 of these 56 cases. These results reveal that immunohistochemical assessment does not predict TP53 mutation status in colorectal adenocarcinoma, mainly in cases displaying absence of nuclear staining. It is thus concluded that molecular profiling should be conducted in parallel with immunophenotyping when analyzing colorectal tumors for p53 status",

    "Title": "Microarray analysis reveals that",
    "Abstract": "The ATM/p53-dependent DNA damage response pathway plays an important role in the progression of lymphoid tumors. Inactivation of the ATM or TP53 gene is frequent in B-cell lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and leads to aggressive disease. Although the ATM and p53 pathways overlap, they are not congruent, and it is unclear how the mechanism of tumor progression differs between ATM- and p53-deficient tumors. Using microarray analysis of ATM-mutant, TP53-mutant, and ATM/TP53 wild-type B-CLLs, we show that after exposure to DNA damage transcriptional responses are entirely dependent on ATM function. The p53 proapoptotic responses comprise only a part of ATM-regulated transcription; additionally, ATM regulates prosurvival responses independently of p53. Consequently, the greater severity of the TP53-mutant B-CLLs compared with ATM-mutant B-CLLs is consistent with the additive effect of defective apoptotic and elevated survival responses after DNA damage in these tumors. We also show that transcription expression profiles of ATM-deficient, TP53-deficient, and wild-type B-CLLs are indistinguishable before irradiation. Therefore, damage-induced transcriptional fingerprinting can be used to stratify tumors according to their biologic differences and simultaneously identify potential targets for treating refractory tumors",

    "Abstract": "To investigate possible causes of the variable response to treatment in pediatric B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to establish potential novel therapeutic targets, we used ionizing radiation (IR) exposure as a model of DNA damage formation to identify tumors with resistance to p53-dependent apoptosis. Twenty-one of 40 ALL tumors responded normally to IR, exhibiting accumulation of p53 and p21 proteins and cleavage of caspases 3, 7, and 9 and of PARP1. Nineteen tumors exhibited apoptotic resistance and lacked PARP1 and caspase cleavage; although 15 of these tumors had normal accumulation of p53 and p21 proteins, examples exhibited abnormal expression of TRAF5, TRAF6, and cIAP1 after IR, suggesting increased NF-kappaB prosurvival signaling as the mechanism of apoptotic resistance. The presence of a hyperactive PARP1 mutation in one tumor was consistent with such increased NF-kappaB activity. PARP1 inhibition restored p53-dependent apoptosis after IR in these leukemias by reducing NF-kappaB DNA binding and transcriptional activity. In the remaining 4 ALL tumors, apoptotic resistance was associated with a TP53 mutation or with defective activation of p53. We conclude that increased NF-kappaB prosurvival signaling is a frequent mechanism by which B-precursor ALL tumors develop apoptotic resistance to IR and that PARP1 inhibition may improve the DNA damage response of these leukemias",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The objective of the current study was to determine whether tumor cells harboring P53 and K-ras mutations could be detected in histopathologically tumor-free surgical margins in patients with nonsmall cell lung carcinoma who underwent complete pulmonary resection. METHODS: In 118 consecutive patients, DNA obtained from primary tumors and from surgical margins was extracted for molecular analysis. A fragment of P53 gene encompassing exons 5-8 and codon 12 of the K-ras gene were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction technique and were assayed for the presence of mutations. RESULTS: P53 and K-ras mutations were found in 30% and 39% of primary tumors, respectively, and in 11 (9%) and 22 (18%) apparently tumor-free surgical margins, respectively. At least 1 of those mutations was found in surgical margins in 29 patients (25%), and both mutations were found in 2 patients (1.7%). P53 mutations in surgical margins accompanied mutations in primary tumors in 9 of 35 patients (26%), and K-ras mutations accompanied mutations in primary tumors in 20 of 46 patients (44%). Among patients with either mutation in primary tumors, the incidence of at least 1 mutation in surgical margins was 43% (28 of 65 patients). In four patients, mutations (two K-ras mutations and two P53 mutations) were found in surgical margins despite the absence of the corresponding mutations in primary tumors. The presence of mutations in primary tumors and in surgical margins was not related significantly to clinical characteristics or to patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: P53 and K-ras mutations are frequent events in surgical margins determined to be tumor free on light microscopy. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be established",

    "Title": "Mutational spectra of p53 in geographically localized esophageal squamous cell carcinoma groups in China",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Esophageal carcinoma is a particularly interesting tumor because of the dramatic difference in its incidence and geographic distribution among populations of similar ethnic origin. Epidemiologic data have suggested that many environmental exposures may be associated with an increased risk of its formation. METHODS: In this study, 92 samples of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were collected from patients who resided in 2 geographic areas in China with different incidences of ESCC: Linxian and Zhejiang. Overexpression and mutations of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene were examined by using immunohistochemistry, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and direct sequencing. RESULTS: The rates of point mutation and overexpression of p53 in the ESCC specimens studied were 30.4% (29 of 92 specimens) and 51.1% (47 of 92 specimens), respectively. The overexpression of p53 was associated with tumor metastasis and with 5-year case fatality. Significant differences were found in the rates of overexpression and mutations in patients with clinical T2 tumors between the specimens from Linxian, which is a high-incidence geographic area, and the specimens from Zhejiang, which is a low-incidence area. Furthermore, different mutational spectra were found in the tumor samples from these two geographic areas: In tumor samples from Linxian, the most common substitution mutation was a transversion in exon 5, whereas the most common mutations in tumor samples from Zhejiang were transitions in exon 7. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the mutation and overexpression of p53 may play important roles in the development of ESCC. The changes in p53 may reflect environmental exposure to the different combinations of mutagenic factors and genetic instability demonstrated by the populations in Linxian and Zhejiang. The overexpression of p53 protein may have significance as a prognostic factor for patients with esophageal carcinoma",

    "Title": "Characterization of FAMPAC, a newly identified human pancreatic carcinoma cell line with a hereditary background",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: A novel pancreatic carcinoma cell line, FAMPAC, was identified from investigation of poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells found in a patient with a familial predisposition to pancreatic carcinoma. A gene responsible for familial pancreatic carcinoma has not been identified to date. METHODS: The FAMPAC cell line was characterized by its morphology, growth rate, tumorigenicity, and chromosomal analysis. Three known tumor suppressor genes, p16/CDKN2, BRCA2, and p53, all of which are important in the development of pancreatic carcinoma and frequently are involved in a variety of cancer syndromes, were analyzed. RESULTS: FAMPAC cells grew as an adhering monolayer in culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and formed tumors rapidly in nude mice. The doubling time ranged from 24 to 48 hours. Karyotype analysis demonstrated the complexity of chromosomal deletions and rearrangements. The cells were negative for ductal differentiation markers such as cytokeratin 7 and MUC1, indicating poor differentiation. Analysis of FAMPAC cells revealed overexpression of the mutated p53 gene (exon 5, codon 175: CGC --> CAC), the presence of a homozygous deletion in the p16 gene, and the presence of wild-type BRCA2 in the tested hot spots. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, FAMPAC is the first established human pancreatic carcinoma cell line associated with a familial background. FAMPAC is a tumorigenic cell line with a complex molecular pattern of mutations. These findings may be useful in understanding the mechanisms responsible for the development of sporadic or hereditary forms of pancreatic carcinoma",

    "Title": "p53 apoptotic pathway molecules are frequently and simultaneously altered in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung carcinomas show frequent inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor, which regulates an apoptotic pathway. The objective of the current study was to assess how the p53 apoptotic pathway is altered in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), especially in tumors without p53 alterations. METHODS: p53, its upstream regulators (p14(ARF) and HDM2), and downstream effectors of the apoptotic pathway (BAX and BCL2) were studied in 118 NSCLC specimens. p53 was analyzed by single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis covering exons 2-11 and by immunohistochemistry (IHC). p14(ARF) was analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and IHC. HDM2 was analyzed using Southern blot analysis and IHC. BAX and BCL2 were analyzed by IHC. Two other upstream regulators that regulate the stability of HDM2, PTEN and HAUSP, also were studied. RESULTS: Of 118 NSCLC specimens that were analyzed, p53 alterations were detected in 74 tumors (63%), p14(ARF) inactivation was detected in 53 tumors (45%), and overexpression of HDM2 was found in 31 tumors (26%), including 6 tumors with gene amplification. Although p53 inactivation and HDM2 overexpression were detected simultaneously, HDM2 gene amplification was observed only in tumor specimens without p53 mutations. IHC revealed PTEN down-regulation in 22 of 88 tumors (25%). HAUSP Northern blot analysis demonstrated several-fold differences in gene expression that did not correlate with p53 alterations. Of 118 NSCLC specimens, expression of BAX and BCL2 expression were detected in 46 tumors (39%) and 17 tumors (14%), respectively. Finally, ASPP1 and ASPP2, molecules involved in mediating the transcription function of p53, were not found to be aberrantly expressed when tested by Northern blot analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, two or more p53 pathway components were found to be frequently altered in patients with NSCLC. Greater than 90% of the alterations were due to abnormalities of p53, p14(ARF), or HDM2. Therefore, the inactivation of one or more components of the p53 pathway appears to be a prerequisite for the development of most NSCLCs",

    "Title": "A modified yeast assay used on archival samples of localized prostate cancer tissue improves the detection of p53 abnormalities and increases their predictive value",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and predictive value of p53 mutations in localized prostate cancer, comparing the accuracy of detection using immunohistochemistry (IHC) with a modified yeast assay, on archival tissue samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prostate cancer tissue was obtained from 98 patients who had >/= 2 years of clinical follow-up after radical prostatectomy. DNA sequencing was used to verify the presence of p53 mutations in samples that were immunopositive or that gave evidence for p53 alterations using the yeast assay. The IHC and yeast findings were compared with patient outcome to determine the predictive value of these two test types. RESULTS: Fifty-five tumours (57%) were immunopositive, and 58 (59%) were positive using the yeast assay. Sequence-confirmed p53 mutations occurred in 44 (45%) cases. The IHC protocol generated 49% (27/55) false-positive and 36% (15/42) false-negative results, and was 65% sensitive and 50% specific, with an overall accuracy of 57%. The yeast assay resulted in 24% (14/58) false-positive results with a specificity of 74% and an accuracy of 86%. When the p53 status of these patients was correlated with their clinical outcome, patients who had sequence-confirmed p53 mutations had a 2.6-fold greater failure rate (P = 0.026) and a 2.5-fold greater risk of dying from prostate cancer (P = 0.05). Notably, mutations in exon 6 predicted a six-fold increase in treatment failure (P = 0.043) and a 5.3-fold increase in the chance of dying from prostate cancer (P = 0.009). Abnormal yeast-assay findings gave similar predictive results to those obtained for DNA sequencing, while immunopositivity did not correspond to patient outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations of p53 occurred in 45% of localized prostate cancers. These alterations have important prognostic implications. The yeast assay was more accurate for detecting p53 mutations than the IHC protocol used and, unlike IHC, the results of the yeast assay were predictive of patient outcome",

    "Title": "p53 overexpression and mutation in metaplastic carcinoma of the breast: genetic evidence for a monoclonal origin of both the carcinomatous and the heterogeneous sarcomatous components",
    "Abstract": "Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast (MCB) is characterized by the biphasic presence of both a carcinomatous component (CC) and heterogeneous sarcomatous components (HSCs). Although an epithelial or myoepithelial origin of the HSCs has been suggested, molecular evidence for a common origin for the CC and HSCs is limited and the mechanism underlying the sarcomatous or metaplastic change is unknown. The present study investigated the frequency and nature of p53 expression and mutation in 11 biphasic and three monophasic MCBs by immunohistochemistry and either needle-assisted or laser-capture microdissection, followed by PCR and direct sequencing. In all 11 biphasic MBCs, staining for p53 was concordant in the CC and HSCs (8/11 positive and 3/11 negative), consistent with a monoclonal origin of both components. Significantly, whenever a component of carcinoma in situ was present (5/11), the p53 staining was always concordant with that in the CC and HSCs. Screening of the 14 cases for p53 mutation identified four mutants, each in a single case of biphasic MCB with concordant p53 overexpression. Both the CC and each of the HSCs revealed identical p53 mutation in all four cases; in addition, one of the four cases also had an in situ component and the same mutant was found simultaneously in the in situ, invasive, and sarcomatous components. The concordant pattern of p53 alteration (overexpression or mutation) implies that early p53 mutation, occurring prior to invasion, was maintained throughout tumour progression and metaplastic change. The findings therefore support a monoclonal histogenesis of the various components, but are neutral regarding the role of p53 alteration in the development of metaplastic change in MCBs",

    "Title": "Inactivation of the ARF-MDM-2-p53 pathway in sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma in children",
    "Abstract": "Burkitt's lymphomas (BLs) are characterized by an activated MYC gene that provides a constitutive proliferative signal. However, activated myc can initiate ARF-dependent activation of p53 and apoptosis as well. Data derived from cell culture and animal models suggest that the inactivation of the ARF-MDM-2-p53 apoptotic signaling pathway may be a necessary secondary event for the development of BL. This has not been tested in freshly excised BL tissue. We investigated the ARF-MDM-2-p53 pathway in tumor specimen from 24 children with sporadic BL/B-ALL. Direct sequencing revealed a point mutation in the p53 gene in four BL. Overexpression of MDM-2 was evident in 10 of the BL samples analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. Deletion of the CDKN2A locus that encodes ARF or reduced expression of ARF could not be detected in any BL by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis or real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. Our results indicate that the ARF-MDM-2-p53 apoptotic pathway is disrupted in about 55% of the cases of childhood sporadic BL. We suggest that in addition to the inactivation of the ARF-MDM-2-p53 protective checkpoint function other antiapoptotic mutations may occur in a substantial part of children with sporadic BL",

    "Title": "Characterization of a new cytogenetic subtype of ductal breast carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "About 50% of ductal breast carcinomas do not yield analysable karyotypes after short-term culturing. Comparison of the cytogenetic subset to the whole data set of tumors revealed that slightly hyperdiploid tumors, that is, with DNA index between 1.05 and 1.3, were under-represented in tumors for which cytogenetic analysis was successful. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the pattern of chromosome imbalances in this subset differs from that generally reported. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used on 43 primary ductal breast carcinomas selected for slight hyperdiploidy. Microsatellite instability (MSI), TP53 mutation and expression were also investigated. All tumors were MSI negative. In all, 18 tumors (42%) presented mostly unbalanced chromosome rearrangements and DNA amplifications, with only few or no whole chromosome gains (WCG). This pattern of chromosome imbalances corresponds to that described in most breast tumors by previous cytogenetic and CGH analyses. It was associated with TP53 mutation in 17% of tumors. Another subset of 17 tumors (39%) displayed different and new features, characterized by recurrent gains of whole chromosomes 5, 7 and 8 with few chromosome rearrangements, rare DNA amplifications and no TP53 mutation. Eight tumors with as many rearrangements as WCG were left unclassified. We propose that, beside a major pathway characterized by multiple chromosome rearrangements, there is a minor pathway mainly characterized by WCG",

    "Title": "Aberrations of the Chk2 tumour suppressor in advanced urinary bladder cancer",
    "Abstract": "Checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) is a tumour suppressor and signal transducer in genome integrity checkpoints that coordinate cell-cycle progression with DNA repair or cell death in response to DNA damage. Defects of Chk2 occur in subsets of diverse sporadic malignancies and predispose to several types of hereditary carcinomas. However, the status of Chk2 in tumours of the urinary bladder remains unknown. Here, we report that among 58 advanced (grade T2-T4) human bladder carcinomas, immunohistochemical analysis revealed tumour-specific reduction or lack of Chk2 protein in 6 (10.3%) cases. Genetic analysis of the latter subset showed that a Chk2-negative carcinoma #668 harboured a truncating mutation 1100delC, in one Chk2 allele and loss of the corresponding second allele. The 1100delC mutation was also found in the germ line of this patient. Sequencing of TP53 in tumour #668 identified two missense mutations. Furthermore, the vast majority of the tumours showed 'unscheduled' activatory phosphorylation on Thr68 of Chk2 in the absence of any DNA-damaging treatment. Our results indicate that the otherwise dormant DNA damage signal transducer Chk2 is aberrantly and constitutively activated in invasive urinary bladder carcinomas, and that such likely proapoptotic checkpoint signalling can be disabled by inactivation of Chk2 and/or p53 tumour suppressors in subsets of these tumours",

    "Title": "BRAF alterations are associated with complex mutational profiles in malignant melanoma",
    "Abstract": "To evaluate the mutational profiles associated with BRAF mutations in human melanoma, we have studied BRAF, RAS, PTEN, TP53, CDKN2A and CDK4 genes and their expression in melanoma lesions. Owing to the lack of sufficient material from fresh specimens, we employed short-term cell lines obtained from melanoma biopsies. In all, 41 melanoma obtained from eight primary lesions, 20 nodal, 11 cutaneous and two visceral metastases from patients with sporadic (n=31), familial (n=4) and multiple melanoma (n=2) were analysed. The results revealed novel missense mutations in the BRAF, PTEN, CDKN2A and CDK4 genes. Overall, activating mutations of BRAF and loss of functional p16 and ARF were detected in the majority of melanomas (29/41, 36/41 and 29/41, respectively), while PTEN alterations/loss, NRAS and TP53 mutations occurred less frequently (6/41, 6/41 and 10/41, respectively). In the resulting 12 mutational profiles, p16/ARF loss associated with mutated BRAFV599E was the most represented (n=15). In addition, TP53 and PTEN mutations were always accompanied with BRAF alterations, while PTEN loss was found in association with CDKN2A or TP53 mutations in the absence of BRAF activation. The p16/ARFDelta+BRAF/RAS profile was significantly associated with a longer survival, while complex mutational profiles were detected in highly aggressive disease and poor survival. These data support the existence of several molecularly defined melanoma groups which likely reflect different clinical/biological behaviour, thus suggesting that a more extensive molecular classification of melanoma would significantly impact its clinical management",

    "Title": "p53 disruption profoundly alters the response of human glioblastoma cells to DNA topoisomerase I inhibition",
    "Abstract": "A critical challenge in cancer research is to identify genetic lesions that sensitize patients to chemotherapy. p53, which is mutated in nearly one-third to half of glioblastomas, may be such a lesion. In this paper, we demonstrate that p53 disruption dramatically sensitizes glioblastoma cells to DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor-mediated apoptosis. Using 19 glioblastoma cell lines, including 15 low-passage ex vivo cell lines derived from patients, as well as isogenic glioblastoma cells varying in p53 status, we show that clinically relevant levels of SN-38 potently induce cell cycle arrest and temporary senescence in glioblastoma cells with wild-type p53 while causing massive apoptosis in p53-deficient cells (P<0.0002). We demonstrate that glioblastoma cells with wild-type p53 proliferate when recultured in drug-free medium, whereas p53-deficient cells do not. We also show that p16 protein expression is neither necessary nor sufficient for initiation and/or maintenance of SN-38-induced arrest/senescence. These results indicate that p53 disruption has a dramatic effect on how glioblastoma cells process topoisomerase I inhibitor-mediated DNA damage",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish a series of clinically relevant orthotopic transplantation models of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma from both cell lines and primary tumors under uniform experimental conditions. METHODS: Ten pancreatic cancer cell lines and 12 primary tumors were orthotopically transplanted in SCID mice. The cell lines and xenografts were characterized for K-ras, BRAF, p53, p16, and DPC4 aberrations employing direct sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting. RESULTS: All xenografts showed high intrapancreatic tumorigenicity and extensive local tumor growth, and each showed a unique behavioral and genetic profile. Tumor characteristics were retained during serial passaging. The cell line-derived xenografts represented the entire expected range of histologic differentiation. Although the overall metastatic rate was moderate to high, the metastatic pattern varied; 4 cell lines showed a high metastatic rate to the liver. The primary tumor-derived xenografts retained their similarity to the corresponding original donor tumors with regard to histologic presentation and biologic behavior. K-ras, p53, p16, and DPC4 aberrations were revealed in 80%, 70%, 50%, and 40% of cell lines and 100%, 33%, 75%, and 58% of primary tumor derived xenografts, respectively. No BRAF mutations were present. The metastatic behavior of the xenografts was significantly associated with the degree of histologic differentiation, number of genes altered, and p53 status. CONCLUSIONS: The new models reflected the wide range of patho-biological features and genetic alterations that characterize human pancreatic cancer and may be used collectively or selectively as a markedly improved in vivo tool for preclinical and molecular studies of pancreatic cancer",

    "Title": "Detection of p53 gene mutations in the supernatant of pancreatic juice and plasma from patients with pancreatic carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "AIM: The sensitivity of pure pancreatic juice (PPJ) cytology for the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma (PCa) is still low. The usefulness of genetic analyses of PPJ seems to be limited because of insufficient sensitivity or false positivity. To improve the molecular diagnosis of PCa, we analyzed mutations of p53 together with K-ras in DNA extracted not only from the sediment but also from the supernatant of PPJ samples. METHOD: Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing were used for analyses of p53 mutations in exons 5-8. K-ras mutations at codon 12 were examined by mutant allele-specific amplification. RESULTS: In PPJ supernatant from patients with PCa, p53 and K-ras mutations were detected in 42.9% (9 of 21) and 81.0% (17 of 21) of cases, respectively. The incidence of p53 and K-ras mutations in the sediment was 28.6% and 71.4%, respectively. By a combination assay with supernatant and sediment, p53 mutations were detected in 52.4% (11 of 21) of PCa cases. Moreover, p53 mutations were detected in 7 of 15 (46.7%) cases of PCa in which the cytologic diagnosis was negative. Among 25 patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP), none harbored mutant p53, although K-ras mutations were detected at an incidence of 28% (7 of 25) in the supernatant and 20% (5 of 25) in the sediment. In addition, mutant bands of p53 in plasma were detected in 2 of 11 patients with PCa in whom p53 mutations were detectable in PPJ. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the sensitivity of detection for p53 mutations with high cancer specificity could be improved by using the Sup in PPJ samples of PCa. Genetic analysis of p53 could complement PPJ cytology. p53 mutations were detectable in PCa from plasma samples",

    "Title": "Characterisation of TP53 abnormalities in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia",
    "Abstract": "Abnormalities of TP53 in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) correlate with aggressive disease and transformation. We studied 115 patients with CLL including 90 untreated, 25 with heavily pretreated/refractory CLL using fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) to detect allelic loss at chromosome 17p and flow cytometry (FC) to test p53 protein overexpression. A total of 17 cases were identified with TP53 deletion and/or protein expression. Both tests correlated in 10 of 17 patients; in six, one or the other abnormality was detected and in one case, with a deletion, flow cytometry failed. Material for direct DNA sequencing was available in 14 of 17 cases. Mutations were found in seven cases. Five of 14 patients with allelic loss and seven of 13 expressing p53 protein had a mutation. These were single-base substitutions and were located in exons 5, 7 or 8. Mutations were not found in 13 of 14 other cases without deletions by FISH or protein expression. The incidence of p53 abnormalities in this series was 15%, with a significant difference between untreated patients (7%) and the pretreated/refractory group (50%; P<0.01). Abnormal p53 was predicted for shorter survival, regardless of the method used. We confirm that p53 abnormalities are more common in refractory CLL and that mutations occur at the known hot spots. Testing for TP53 deletions by FISH and protein expression by FC is an effective and simple way of screening patients who are likely to have aggressive disease. DNA sequencing adds little to these methods in identifying the population at risk",

    "Abstract": "MYH, OGG1 and MTH1 are members of base excision repair (BER) families, and MYH germline mutations were recently identified in patients with multiple adenomas or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). A total of 20 APC-negative Korean FAP patients were analyzed for OGG1, MYH and MTH1 germline mutations. A total of 19 hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), 86 suspected HNPCC, and 246 sporadic colorectal cancer cases were investigated for OGG1 and MYH mutations. A total of 14 R154H OGG1 polymorphisms were identified in hereditary, sporadic colorectal cancers, and normal controls. For the case-control analysis of OGG1 R154H, a total of 625 hereditary or sporadic colorectal cancer patients and 527 normal controls were screened. R154H was a rare polymorphism associated with sporadic colorectal cancer patents (OR: 3.586, P= 0.053). R154H does not segregate with cancer phenotypes. Upon examining the possibility of recessive inheritance of R154H, we could not identify any complementary mutations in OGG1, MYH or MTH1. Samples with R154H were further screened for mutations of K-ras, beta-catenin, APC, p53, BRAF and the microsatellite instability (MSI) status. Eight somatic mutations were identified in these genes and G:C to T:A transversion mutations were not dominant in samples harboring R154H. This result raises the possibility that OGG1 R154H may function as a low/moderate-penetrance modifier for colorectal cancer development",

    "Abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the frequency and prognostic impact of TP53 alterations stratified for the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism (c.215G>C, p.Arg72Pro) in a cohort of 109 patients with advanced ovarian carcinomas. TP53 sequence variants were observed in 80 of the 109 (73.4%) tumors and were significantly associated with grade of differentiation (P=0.001). A tendency towards higher frequency of sequence variants in tumors with higher FIGO stages was seen (P=0.05). The type of TP53 sequence variant (transition A:T>G:C vs. G:C>A:T at CpG dinucleotides, and transversion G:C>T:A) had significant correlation with patients' age (P=0.04) with more A:T>G:C in patients over 60 years old. No significant associations were found between frequency of sequence variants and age at diagnosis, histological type, size of residual tumor after primary surgery, or long-term survival. Analyses of the codon 72 polymorphism in tumor DNA gave a higher frequency of homozygosity/hemizygosity than expected from the population frequency, particularly for the Pro allele. Tumors homozygous or hemizygous for the Pro allele had significantly higher frequency of TP53 sequence variants, particularly of the nonmissense type (P=0.002), and patients with these types of alterations had significantly shorter survival (P=0.04). TP53 protein accumulation, determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), was found in 67.9% (74 out of 109) of the tumors, was significantly more common among serous than nonserous ovarian carcinomas (P=0.008), and had a significant effect on progression-free survival (P=0.03). p63 (TP73L; formerly TP63) and p73 (TP73) protein accumulation detected by IHC was seen in 67.9 and 0% of the tumors, respectively. A significantly higher frequency of p63-positive cases was seen among serous tumors (P=0.008) and tended to increase with increasing FIGO stages (P=0.05), but had no significant effect on survival.

    "Title": "Clinical and molecular analysis of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CC) show dual hepatocellular and biliary epithelial differentiation. To better understand the relations between cholangiocarcinoma (CC), HCC-CC and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we screened for genetic alterations. METHODS: A series of nine CC, 15 HCC-CC and three separated HCC and CC lesions ('collision tumors') were screened for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using 400 microsatellite markers and for p53 and beta-catenin mutations. A comparison with a previously characterized series of 137 HCC was performed. RESULTS: In six cases of CC and HCC-CC, we identified TP53 gene mutations. A CTNNB1/beta-catenin was identified in two patients presenting collision tumors, but no mutations were found in CC or in HCC-CC. A high level of chromosome instability in both CC and HCC-CC was found. Recurrent specific LOH were identified at 3p and 14q in more than 50% of the CC and the HCC-CC cases, whereas these chromosomal regions were deleted in less than 10% of the HCC cases (P<10(-5)). Minimal common regions of deletion (MCRD) were defined at 3p24-p14 and 14q24-q32, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that combined HCC-CC are genetically closer to CC than HCC and common carcinogenesis pathways may be altered in HCC-CC and CC",

    "Title": "Humoral response to p53 is associated with conserved domains II and IV mutations in human colorectal cancer: a case-control study in Taiwan",
    "Abstract": "To explore the relationship between mutations of the p53 gene, p53 protein accumulation in tumor tissues and the presence of anti-p53 antibodies (Ab) in sera, a matched case-control study with 63 colorectal cancer patients positive for p53-Ab was carried out. These control patients were matched for age, gender, as well as tumor site and stage with 63 colorectal cancer patients positive for p53-Ab. The study was designed to analyze their p53 gene mutations in exons 4-9 by the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) followed by direct sequencing, as well as measuring p53 protein accumulation by immunohistochemistry. A significantly higher frequency of p53 mutations in exon 4-9 and positive immunohistochemical staining of p53 protein was observed in tumors from p53-Ab positive patients (55.56 and 84.13%, respectively) than in tumors from p53-Ab negative patients (22.22 and 60.32%, respectively). Using a conditional logistic regression model, the humoral response to p53 was found to be associated with p53 gene mutation (OR = 3.34; 95% CI, 1.31-8.54, p=0.012) and p53 protein accumulation (OR = 3.80; 95% CI, 1.02-14.14, p=0.047). Further analysis showed that the frequency of p53 mutations located in the conserved domains II (codons 112-141) and IV (codons 234-258) was significantly higher in p53-Ab positive patients than in p53-Ab negative patients (50.00% (16/32) vs. 8.33% (1/12), p=0.015, Fisher's exact test). Thus, our study demonstrated that the generation of p53 antibodies was usually correlated with the p53 protein accumulation and p53 gene mutation, especially mutations located in conserved domains II and IV",

    "Title": "Possible distinct molecular carcinogenic pathways for bladder cancer in Ukraine, before and after the Chernobyl disaster",
    "Abstract": "After the Chernobyl accident in 1986, the incidence of urinary bladder cancers in the Ukraine increased gradually from 26.2 to 43.3 per 100,000 people between 1986 and 2001. In the areas of low level but persistent cesium-137 (137Cs) radio-contamination, a unique atypical radiation-related urinary bladder cystitis named 'Chernobyl cystitis', a possible pre-neoplastic condition in humans, has been detected. We have previously documented high incidences of bladder lesions, including severe dysplasias and/or carcinoma in situ, in association with this cystitis and correlating with oxidative DNA damage. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying bladder carcinogenesis with this specific etiology, mutation analysis of p53 gene (exon 5-8) was performed for 11 and 18 paraffin-embedded bladder cancers in Ukrainians, respectively collected before and after the Chernobyl disaster. DNAs were extracted and subjected to nested PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis followed by direct DNA sequencing, as well as p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC). The incidences of p53 gene mutation were 54.5 and 16.7% for before and after the Chernobyl disaster, respectively, the difference being statistically significant. Also a tendency for higher p53 IHC score was apparent in the earlier group of lesions. No significant difference was noted for the proportions of historical types. These results point to possible distinct molecular carcinogenic pathways of bladder cancer formation, before and after the Chernobyl disaster, on the basis of variation in p53 gene alteration",

    "Title": "Spectrum of p53 mutations in biopsies from breast cancer patients selected for preoperative chemotherapy analysed by the functional yeast assay to predict therapeutic response",
    "Abstract": "The most frequent alteration detected in breast cancer cells is an inactivation of the tumor protein p53. Numerous studies revealed that p53 mutations are an independent prognostic indicator of a shorter period of overall and disease-free survival. Meta-analysis of these investigations clearly showed that prognostic significance cannot be achieved by indirect assessment of the p53 status by immunohistochemistry. Therefore, the tumor RNA-based functional p53 assay in yeast (functional assay of separated alleles in yeast, FASAY) appears to be an attractive option to generate clinically relevant information without the need of microdissection. We describe FASAY analyses of 50 biopsies taken before pre-operative anthracycline/taxane chemotherapy to evaluate the predictive value of p53 mutations for this common combination of substances. Wild-type p53, present in 22 samples, resulted in numerous white colonies with a low background of red colonies that was consistently below 8%. Biopsy samples containing mutated alleles gave rise to many red colonies accompanied with variable numbers of white colonies. With one single exception, all biopsies containing mutated p53 resulted in more than 8% red colonies. In 25 samples (53%), 23 single and 2 double mutations of the p53 gene were confirmed by sequencing of DNA from the yeast colonies. Six of the observed sequence insertions or deletions and 2 of the point mutations have not been reported previously. In accordance with an abolished or altered function as a transcriptional activator, most mutations affected the p53 DNA-binding domain, and one the tetramerization domain. Our results confirmed that the FASAY is sufficiently reliable to detect p53 mutations in breast tumor biopsies. In this pilot study with a limited number of patients to evaluate the predictive value of p53 mutations for an anthracycline/taxane combination therapy in the neoadjuvant setting, stable disease was observed more often in patients with wild-type p53 but statistical significance was not quite reached for this clear trend",

    "Abstract": "The conversion from a carcinomatous component to a sarcomatous one in spindle cell carcinoma (SPCC) of the upper aerodigestive tract is thought to occur via a series of molecular alterations; however the detailed mechanism is still unknown. We examined mutations at the H-ras and p53 genes in 16 SPCCs of upper aerodigestive tracts using PCR-RFLP, PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing analysis. The two distinct components, sarcomatous and carcinomatous components in SPCC, were analyzed independently. p53 mutations were detected in both components of SPCC (50.0%, 8/16), and those in the sarcomatous component were completely in accordance with those in the carcinomatous one. In contrast, H-ras mutations were detected only in the sarcomatous component (12.5%, 2/16), and not in the carcinomatous one (0%, 0/16). There was a statistically significant difference in prognosis between the patients with the H-ras mutation (n=2) and those without (n=14); the former had poorer prognosis (P=0.0049). Our results seem to suggest that the H-ras mutation is a relatively uncommon event in SPCC; however, the presence of H-ras mutations may be associated with a more malignant potential in SPCC, while actually occurring during the sarcomatous change itself",

Wild-type TP53 was found more frequently in cancer specimens that contained HPV16 DNA than in those that did not. All 14 HPV16 DNA-positive cancers in HPV16 E6 antibody-positive patients contained wild-type TP53, compared with 50% of corresponding HPV DNA-negative cancers (matched odds ratio, infinity; 95% confidence interval, 1.4- infinity ). In contrast, for HPV16 DNA-positive cancers in E6-negative patients, wild-type TP53 frequency was similar to that in corresponding HPV DNA-negative cancers (matched odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-5.4). TP53 inactivation is a major mechanism of HPV-related carcinogenesis in the oral cavity and oropharynx. The role of HPV in cancers also containing TP53 mutations remains to be clarified",

    "Title": "Genetic pathways to glioblastoma: a population-based study",
    "Abstract": "We conducted a population-based study on glioblastomas in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (population, 1.16 million) to determine the frequency of major genetic alterations and their effect on patient survival. Between 1980 and 1994, 715 glioblastomas were diagnosed. The incidence rate per 100,000 population/year, adjusted to the World Standard Population, was 3.32 in males and 2.24 in females. Observed survival rates were 42.4% at 6 months, 17.7% at 1 year, and 3.3% at 2 years. For all of the age groups, younger patients survived significantly longer, ranging from a median of 8.8 months (<50 years) to 1.6 months (>80 years). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 10q was the most frequent genetic alteration (69%), followed by EGFR amplification (34%), TP53 mutations (31%), p16(INK4a) deletion (31%), and PTEN mutations (24%). LOH 10q occurred in association with any of the other genetic alterations and was predictive of shorter survival. Primary (de novo) glioblastomas prevailed (95%), whereas secondary glioblastomas that progressed from low-grade or anaplastic gliomas were rare (5%). Secondary glioblastomas were characterized by frequent LOH 10q (63%) and TP53 mutations (65%). Of the TP53 mutations in secondary glioblastomas, 57% were in hotspot codons 248 and 273, whereas in primary glioblastomas, mutations were more equally distributed. G:C-->A:T mutations at CpG sites were more frequent in secondary than primary glioblastomas (56% versus 30%; P = 0.0208). This suggests that the acquisition of TP53 mutations in these glioblastoma subtypes occurs through different mechanisms",

    "Title": "Clustering of minimal deleted regions reveals distinct genetic pathways of human hepatocellular carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Systematic scan and statistical analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has been widely used to define chromosomal aberrations in various cancers for cloning of tumor suppressor genes and for development of prognostic markers. However, the establishment of novel strategies is needed, so that the nonrandom but heterogeneous chromosomal aberration data could provide significant insights into our understanding of molecular pathogenesis of cancers. After comprehensive allelotyping of recurrent allelic losses with 441 highly informative microsatellite markers and overlapping LOH regions on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) chromosomes, 33 minimal deleted regions (MDRs) were revealed. Five and 15 of the 33 MDRs have physical intervals in less than 5 and 10 Mb, respectively, with the smallest MDR9p1 of 2.2 Mb located at 9p21.3-p21.2. Statistical and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significant association between the loss of MDR15q1 (15q21.1-q22.2) and the HCC patient survival (adjusted P = 0.033). After cluster analysis of 33 MDRs that represented LOH profiles of each HCC tissue based on clinicopathological features and p53 mutations, two major genetic pathways, low-stage and advanced-stage HCC, were uncovered based on high concordance of MDR clusters. We propose that the definition of genome-wide MDRs on the cancer genome not only narrows down the location of existing tumor suppressor genes to facilitate positional candidate cloning and develop potential prognostic markers after statistical association of MDRs with clinicopathological features but also dissects genetic interactions and pathways of chromosomal aberrations in tumorigenesis",

    "Title": "Alterations of the p16INK4a/p14ARF pathway in clear cell sarcoma",
    "Abstract": "Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) is a very rare soft tissue sarcoma with a poor prognosis. It has become apparent through immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and microarray analyses that CCS is a soft tissue melanocytic neoplasm. Alterations in the p16INK4a/p14ARF gene are common in malignant melanoma, which is the prototypical melanocytic neoplasm. In the present study, we performed a clinicopathologic analysis and investigated p16 and cyclin D1 expression by immunohistochemistry in 14 cases. Furthermore, we investigated genetic changes of various tumor suppressor genes and an oncogene, including p16INK4a/p14ARF, p53, beta-catenin, and APC, in 11 cases. The 5-year overall survival rate in all the patients was 33.3%. A high mitotic rate was a significant adverse prognostic factor (P = 0.004). Decreased expression of p16 was observed in 4 (28.6%) of 14 cases. Overexpression of cyclin D1 was observed in 9 cases (64.3%). SSCP analysis followed by DNA direct sequencing revealed point mutations of the p16INK4a gene in 2 of 11 cases (18.2%). In addition, one case with the p14ARF mutation and 2 cases with the p53 mutation were observed. None of the cases harbored mutation of the beta-catenin or APC gene. Homozygous deletion of the p16INK4a/p14ARF gene was detected in one case. Methylation-specific PCR did not reveal hypermethylation of the p16INK4a/p14ARF promoter region in any of the cases. Three cases harbored genetic alterations of the p16INK4a/p14ARF gene (27.3%). All tumors with genetic alterations of the p16INK4a/p14ARF or p53 gene showed a high mitotic rate or tumor necrosis. These alterations were considered to be influential in the poor prognosis of CCS patients",

    "Title": "Dependence of chemotherapy response on p53 mutation status in a panel of human cancer lines maintained in nude mice",
    "Abstract": "In contrast to findings in vitro, the clinical response to anticancer chemotherapy is not simply associated with the p53 mutation status. To analyze the relationship between the actual response of solid tumors with p53 mutation and other biological characteristics, we used a human cancer-nude mouse panel of 21 lines derived from stomach, colorectal, breast, lung, and liver cancers for experimental chemotherapy. We examined the tumor growth rates of the cancer lines and the effects of nine drugs in clinical use, namely, mitomycin C (MMC), cisplatin (CDDP), nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU), irinotecan (CPT-11), cyclophosphamide (CPA), 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil (FT-207), a 4:1 mixture of uracil and FT-207 (UFT), 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR), and adriamycin (ADM), on these tumors. The chemotherapy response was expressed as the tumor growth inhibition rate (IR). The genomic DNA sequences of the p53 gene in exons 5 through 8 were analyzed in these cancer tissues, and p53 mutations were detected in 10 of the 21 cancer lines (48%). Resistance to MMC was observed in p53 mutant tumors with smaller IRs than those for wild-type tumors (57.7% vs. 79.9%, P < 0.03). No significant differences were noted with the other eight drugs. To explore the role of the p53 function in the chemotherapy response, we calculated the correlation coefficients between chemosensitivity and tumor growth rate separately in p53 mutant and wild-type groups. In the p53 wild-type group, we found a positive correlation for the following drugs: ADM (P < 0.02), ACNU (P < 0.007), CPA (P < 0.011), UFT (P < 0.012), and FT-207 (P < 0.02). In the p53 mutant group, only CPA (P < 0.003) showed a positive correlation. The kinetics suggests that in the wild-type tumors, DNA damage caused by anticancer drugs occurs proportionally to the rate of DNA synthesis, and p53-mediated apoptosis is subsequently induced. The low frequency of positive correlation in the p53 mutant tumors is compatible with the loss of function or malfunction of mutant p53. The present results provide kinetic evidence that p53 function affects the response to anticancer drugs. Preserved p53 function tended to confer good chemosensitivity on rapidly growing tumors. However, the p53 mutation status did not seem to be suitable for use as an exclusive indicator to predict the chemotherapy response of human cancer xenografts",

    "Title": "Loss of p53 transcriptional activity in hepatocellular carcinoma evaluated by yeast-based functional assay: comparison with p53 immunohistochemistry",
    "Abstract": "We studied the transcriptional activity of p53 protein in 50 tissues of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a yeast functional assay. In this assay, red yeast colonies indicate that p53 protein cannot bind to its specific domain and has lost its transcriptional activity. We also clarified whether mutant p53 protein could inactivate wild-type p53 protein in a transdominant manner using a modified yeast assay. In addition, we examined whether immunohistochemically detectable p53 protein was functionally inactive. The incidence of p53 inactivation was significantly higher in tumors with capsular invasion. Out of 21 tumors diagnosed with p53 mutations, 11 exhibited >75% red colonies, and all contained missense mutations. In these tumors, p53 function was lost because there was supposedly no intact p53 gene on either allele. One missense mutant produced <60% red colonies, but it was also considered inactive as a p53 protein heterotetramer because of its transdominant activity. In 7 of the remaining 9 tumors, p53 was considered to be mutated on one allele and intact on the other. All of these 7 tumors contained nonsense or frameshift mutations and had no transdominant activity, which suggested that p53 function remained intact. Alternately, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that all of the tumors with missense mutations were positively immunostained, whereas those that contained nonsense or frameshift mutations were negatively stained. Consequently, positively immunostaining tumors mostly coincided with p53-inactive tumors. These yeast-based assays suggested that p53 function was retained in some mutant cases. Immunohistochemistry was helpful in screening functionally inactive p53 protein in HCCs",

    "Title": "P53, N- and K-Ras, and beta-catenin gene mutations and prognostic factors in nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma from Hokkaido, Japan",
    "Abstract": "We have shown previously that nasal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma was associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and had peculiar clinical features. However, little is known about its biological and genetic changes. The aim of this study is to determine the p53, N- and K-ras, and beta-catenin status in this lymphoma in relation to EBV status and clinical features. The study group consisted of 32 Japanese patients with nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. The p53 and beta-catenin expression, phenotype, and EBV-oncogenic protein latent membrane protein type 1 (LMP-1) were determined by immunoperoxidase staining. The presence of EBV-encoded small nuclear early region (EBER) RNA was determined by in situ hybridization. The p53 mutations (exons 5 to 9), N- and K-ras mutations (exons 1 and 2), and beta-catenin mutations (exon 3) were analyzed by direct sequencing of the PCR-amplified products that were obtained from laser-microdissected tissues. CD56, CD43, and CD3 were expressed in 32 (100%), in 31 (96%), and in 18 (56%) tumors, respectively. EBER RNA was detected in 31 (96%) tumors. LMP-1 was expressed in 15 (48%) tumors, and p53 and beta-catenin protein were overexpressed in 18 (56%) and 4 (13%) tumors, respectively. Six mutations of the p53 gene, 1 mutation of each N- and K-ras gene, and 8 mutations of beta-catenin gene were detected in 6 (19%), 1 (3%), and 5 (16%) tumors, respectively. The p53 missense mutation was associated with LMP-1 expression (P = 0.038), but not with p53 overexpression. Kaplan-Meier analysis as well as univariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards model showed that high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (P = 0.009, P = 0.0100, respectively), large cell, immunoblastoid polymorphous histology (P = 0.005, P = 0.0162, respectively), and p53 missense mutations (P = 0.021, P = 0.0342, respectively) were significantly related to worse cause-specific survival. Multivariate analysis showed that p53 missense mutation was the most independent among these 3 factors. Although the incidence of thep53, N- and K-ras, and beta-catenin gene mutations is not high, p53 missense mutation has a prognostic value for aggressive course in nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma",

    "Abstract": "Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a dermal and subcutaneous tumor categorized as a tumor of intermediate malignancy, and its progression in some cases to fibrosarcoma is well known. However, molecular analysis of tumor progression has been limited. The present study investigated microsatellite instability (MSI) of 7 microsatellite markers through high-resolution microsatellite analysis in addition to a mutational analysis of the p53 gene in 44 tumors in 36 patients. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 9 patients with a fibrosarcomatous component in the primary or recurrent/metastasized tumor, designated as the DFSP+FS group, and the remaining 27 patients, designated as the DFSP group. Cases in which the percentage of markers with an additional peak among the markers successfully analyzed was more than 30% was considered MSI high (MSI-H); cases in which microsatellites were stable at all of the successfully examined markers were considered microsatellite stable (MSS); and the remaining cases were considered MSI low (MSI-L). MSI-H cases were observed more frequently in the DFSP+FS group (4 of 9 cases) than in the DFSP group (1 of 27 cases) (P = 0.028, Fischer's exact test). The MSI status of recurrent or metastatic tumors in both the DFSP+FS and the DFSP groups was the same as that in the corresponding primary neoplasms. Furthermore, there was no difference in MSI status between an ordinary DFSP area and a fibrosarcomatous area in 7 tumors that exhibited both areas. p53 mutational analysis revealed 10 point mutations, composed of 4 missense mutations and 6 silent mutations, in 6 of 36 cases (16.7%). A missense mutation was more frequently observed in the DFSP+FS group (3 of 4) than in the DFSP group (1 of 4). Among 3 cases of a missense mutation in the DFSP+FS group, 2 had a mutation only in a fibrosarcomatous area and 1 had a mutation only in a metastatic tumor progressing to fibrosarcoma. These results suggest that MSI and p53 mutations are involved in tumor progression of DFSP to fibrosarcoma as early and late events, respectively",

    "Abstract": "p73, the first p53 gene homologue, encodes an array of p73 proteins including p73 alpha full-length (TAp73 alpha) and amino-truncated isoforms (Delta Np73 alpha), two proteins with opposite biological functions. TAp73 alpha can induce tumor suppressive properties, while Delta Np73 alpha antagonizes p53 as well as TAp73 in a dominant-negative manner. In human malignant neuroblasts, p53 protein is wild-type but known to be excluded from the nucleus, therefore disabling its function as a tumor suppressor. The present study investigates whether there is a functional link between p73 isoforms and p53 in neuroblastoma. Experiments were performed on two neuroblastoma cell lines differing in their p53 status, e.g. wild-type p53 SH-5Y5Y cells and mutated p53 IGR-N-91 cells. Data indicate that (i) both TA- and Delta N-p73 alpha enhance p53 protein level in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas level remains unchanged in IGR-N-91 cells; (ii) only in SH-SY5Y cells does forced TAp73 alpha overexpression markedly induce nuclear accumulation of p53 protein; (iii) p21 protein expression is increased in both cell lines infected with TAp73, suggesting that, in IGR-N-91 cells, p21 is induced by p73 through a p53-independent pathway; (iv) in the SHSY5Y cell line, Btg2 expression is strongly enhanced in cells overexpressing TA, and to a lesser extent in cells overexpressing Delta N. Taken together our results suggest that TAp73 may restore p53 function in NB with wild-type nonfunctional p53, but not in NB with mutated p53",

    "Title": "MDM2 expression in EBV-infected nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells",
    "Abstract": "To understand whether the p53-regulated mdm2 gene expression was altered by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), the NPC-TW01 cell line was infected by EBV through IgA receptor-mediated endocytosis. The mdm2 gene was expressed only in a small fraction of the NPC cell population and could be enhanced in the EBV-infected (EBV+) cells. In the animals bearing EBV+ and EBV- NPC xenografts, the MDM2+ cells only appeared in clusters in both EBV+ and EBV- tumors with stronger expression in EBV+ cells. Cotransfection of pmdm2-Luc plus pSV40-p53 plus pCMV-LMP1 in the NPC-TW06 line that had p53 heterozygous point mutation showed stronger mdm2 promoter activity than cells cotransfected with pmdm2-Luc plus pSV40-p53, but no mdm2 promoter activity was seen in cells cotransfected with pmdm2-Luc plus pCMV-LMP1. Only the EBV-LMP1 but not the EBV-LMP2A gene could enhance p53 to upregulated mdm2 expression. Tumor cells in NPC biopsy specimens revealed similar mdm2 expression as in the animal model. It is concluded that although EBV can indirectly enhance mdm2 gene expression in tumor cells that express this gene, it cannot turn on or directly regulate mdm2 expression in cells that do not express this gene. In other words, EBV plays a role as an enhancer in NPC tumorigenesis",

    "Title": "Molecular characterization of uterine clear cell carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Clinicopathological studies support a broad classification of endometrial carcinoma into two major types, designated as type I and type II, which correlate with their biological behavior. More recently, molecular studies have provided further insights into this classification scheme by elucidating the genetic events involved in the development and progression of endometrial carcinoma. Microsatellite instability and mutations in the PTEN gene have been widely associated with type I (endometrioid) endometrial carcinoma, while p53 mutations have been identified in the majority of type II endometrial carcinoma, of which uterine serous carcinoma is the prototype. Uterine clear cell carcinoma (UCC) is an uncommon variant of endometrial carcinoma, and clinicopathological studies have produced conflicting results regarding its biological behavior with 5-year survival ranging from 21 to 75%. The molecular characteristics of endometrioid and serous carcinoma have been studied extensively; however, there have been few molecular genetic studies of the clear cell subtype. In this study, we evaluated 16 UCCs (11 pure and 5 mixed) for mutations in the p53 gene, PTEN gene and for microsatellite instability. Although we found that these alterations were uncommon in pure clear cell carcinomas, all three were identified. In addition, two cases of mixed serous and clear cell carcinoma showed an identical mutation of the p53 gene in the histologically distinct components and one case of mixed clear cell and endometrioid carcinoma had identical mutations in the PTEN and p53 genes, and microsatellite instability in both components. Our data suggest that UCC represent a heterogeneous group of tumors that arise via different pathogenetic pathways. Additional molecular studies of pure clear cell carcinoma are required to further elucidate the genetic pathways involved in its development and progression",

    "Title": "Altered expression and molecular abnormalities of cell-cycle-regulatory proteins in rhabdomyosarcoma",
    "Abstract": "Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most commonly occurring soft-tissue sarcoma in children. Some reports have discussed the altered expression and molecular abnormalities of cell-cycle-regulatory proteins in rhabdomyosarcoma; however, variable frequencies of occurrence have been noted. In the current study, among 72 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, the authors evaluated for the expression of p53, MDM2, p16, p21/WAF1, p27, cyclin D1, cyclin E, pRb and E2F-1 protein immunohistochemically and assessed for proliferative activities using MIB-1. We also analyzed the mutation of the p53 gene in 45 cases, the amplification of the MDM2 gene in 18 cases and the mutation of the H-ras gene in 29 cases, using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded materials. Furthermore, we assessed the correlation between clinicopathologic factors and the results of both immunohistochemical and molecular analyses. Alveolar type affected older patients, and it had a significantly higher mitotic rate compared with the embryonal type (P=0.0226). p53 overexpression was detected in 22 (30.6%) of 72 cases, and 10 (22.2%) of 45 cases had p53 gene abnormalities. As for MDM2, its overexpression was found in nine (12.5%) of 72 cases, and three (16.7%) of 18 cases showed MDM2 amplification. A statistically significant association was observed between immunoreaction for MDM2 and p53 overexpression (P=0.0002), and p53 and MDM2 overexpression was significantly correlated with high MIB-1 labeling indices. E2F-1 labeling indices showed a significantly higher score in alveolar type compared with that seen in embryonal type (P=0.0334), but MIB-1 did not. In conclusion, our study suggests that p53 overexpression may be related to tumor progression because tumors with p53 overexpression have a high proliferative activity in the current study. Alveolar type had a significantly higher both mitotic rate and E2F-1 labeling indices when compared with the embryonal type. The current study is the first report of the correlation of E2F-1 with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma",

    "Title": "Evaluation of p53 mutations in premalignant esophageal lesions and esophageal adenocarcinoma using laser capture microdissection",
    "Abstract": "p53 mutations have been implicated in the development of esophageal malignancies. The purpose of this study was to assess more accurately the incidence and types of p53 mutations in Barrett's esophagus (BE) with and without dysplasia and in esophageal adenocarcinoma, using pure preparations of epithelial cells obtained by laser capture microdissection (LCM). Assays were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue samples of normal antrum and premalignant and malignant esophageal samples from 57 patients, including 16 controls, 10 with BE metaplasia alone, 20 with BE-associated dysplasia, and 11 with BE-associated adenocarcinoma. All tissues were processed for LCM. DNA was extracted from isolated cells, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using oligonucleutide primers for exons 5-8 of p53. PCR products were processed for DNA sequencing. p53 sequence abnormalities were identified in 2/16 cases of normal antrum and regenerative/chemical gastritis, 1/10 cases of BE, 1/20 cases of BE with dysplasia, and 2/11 cases of adenocarcinomas. The abnormalities occurred in exons 7 and 8 in the form of point mutations. Our results, using LCM, show that p53 gene mutations are relatively rare in esophageal preneoplastic and neoplastic conditions. Only point mutations were detected, but no deletions/insertions were identified",

    "Title": "Multifocal intrafollicular granulosa cell tumor of the ovary associated with an unusual germline p53 mutation",
    "Abstract": "A 23-year-old woman presented with a 7 cm right multicystic mass in the ovary, which corresponded microscopically to an unusual lesion consisting of a multifocal granulosa cell tumor with intrafollicular ('in situ') growth involving two-thirds of mature follicles. Stromal invasion was found in only one area where neoplastic follicles coalesced. Granulosa cells had atypical, bizarre TP53 positive nuclei with hyperchromatism, abundant mitoses and numerous hyaline globules. The contralateral ovary was normal. From the age of 10 years, the patient had a complex medical history of multiple tumors, including telangiectatic osteosarcoma, typical and malignant phyllodes tumor, reticulohistiocytoma of skin, carcinomas of the breast and lipo- and leiomyosarcoma. The female genital tract also harbored myometrial leiomyomas and an early endometrial carcinoma. Retrospective histologic study of all mesenchymal neoplasms in this patient showed, the conspicuous presence of similar bizarre TP53 positive cells with hyaline globules in all the mesenchymal neoplasms. In the genetic study, a germline p53 gene mutation was detected in exon 10, codon 336, generating a stop codon in the oligomerization domain of the protein (E336X). A further p53 mutation was found in exon 7 in the granulosa cell tumor. Mutation occurred de novo since there was no history of tumors in any family members, all of whom had a wild-type p53. Although this patient shows a typical tumor phenotype of Li Fraumeni syndrome, the germline mutation corresponded to a highly unusual mutated domain, which is similar to the one found in childhood malignant adrenocortical tumor; also a rare neoplasm that originates in adrenocortical cells; which are closely related, both functionally and embryologically, to granulosa cells",

    "Abstract": "We have been subculturing a human mandible-derived osteosarcoma cell line (HOSM-2) for approximately 15 years, and have compared the characters of early generations, which did not exhibit tumorigenicity, to those in the later generations. The shape and doubling time of the cells did not change during long-term culture. The number of chromosomes, however, changed from 59-81 in the 6th generation (modal number: 70) to 54-59 (modal number: 56 and 57), and the chromosomal structure also changed. In addition, the cell line in the later generations showed tumorigenicity in nude mice, and Codon 306 of the p53 gene was mutated to a stop codon due to a point mutation. HOSM-2 cells expressed osteoblast markers, thus confirming them to be osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells. These results showed that changes in certain genes in the HOSM-2 cells led to tumorigenicity in nude mice following long-term culture. In addition, as a mandible-derived cell line with characteristics different from those of limb-derived osteosarcoma cell lines, HOSM-2 cells may be a valuable model for mandibular osteosarcoma and osteoblasts",

    "Abstract": "p53 gene mutation is not a frequent event in the tumorigenesis of lymphomas and the expression of p53 protein is independent of p53 gene mutations. The present study aimed to investigate mutations in the p53 gene in a series of extranodal B-cell lymphomas, and its association with p53 protein expression. A total of 52 cases were graded histologically into Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3 tumors and p53 protein expression was detected using immunohistochemistry. Mutations in the p53 gene were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and mobility shifts were confirmed by direct sequencing. The tumors comprised 26 (50%) Grade 1, 9 (17%) Grade 2 and 15 (29%) Grade 3. A high proportion of Grade 2 (25%) tumors expressed p53 protein (P = 0.051) and carried p53 gene mutation (33%) (P = 0.218). However, p53 protein expression was not associated with p53 gene mutations (P = 0.057). Transversion mutations (88%) were more frequently detected than transition mutations (12%). The present study revealed that p53 gene mutations and p53 protein expression occurred in higher frequencies in Grade 2 tumors, which may be of pathogenetic importance. The high frequency of transversion mutations may reflect the influence of an etiological agent in the tumorigenesis of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma)",

    "Title": "Retention of the arginine allele in codon 72 of the p53 gene correlates with poor apoptosis in head and neck cancer",
    "Abstract": "The allele constitution at codon 72 of the p53 gene (CGC-arginine or CCC-proline) plays a major role in inducing apoptosis in p53 mutant cells. To verify this, we determined GC-status, p53-mutations, and p53-loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in a group of 54 squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN). A novel approach, using a one-step real-time PCR analysis with fluorescent hybridization probes, was applied to detect the GC status in tumors and corresponding blood samples. p53 mutations in exons 4 to 8 were detected by PCR-SSCP-sequencing analysis. Apoptosis was determined immunohistochemically using antibodies against Fas, FasL, p53, Bcl2, and terminal deoxy-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The overall frequency of p53-LOH in SCCHN was 45.2%. In cases of LOH, there was a preferential loss of the proline allele, which was associated with an up-regulation of Bcl2 and lack of co-expression of Fas/FasL and, thus, impaired apoptosis (P < 0.001). Apoptosis was not observed in tumors carrying the arginine allele. p53 mutations were detected in 29.6% of SCCHN and preferentially occurred at the arginine allele (P = 0.01). p53 alterations were more frequently observed in tumors of the oral cavity, oropharynx and hypopharynx, whereas they were rare in larynx carcinomas (P = 0.07). The p53-LOH status was not found to be significantly correlated with sex, age, TNM-status, or tumor grading. We conclude that apoptosis is correlated with the allelic status of codon 72 in SCCHN. Homozygous proline 72 appears to be an important regulator of apoptosis via the Fas/FasL pathway in SCCHN",

    "Abstract": "We conducted the present study to evaluate the frequency and prognostic importance on long-term survival of TP53 mutations and TP53 protein accumulation in a cohort of 178 patients with early-stage ovarian carcinomas. TP53 mutations scored as aberrant temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis pattern from all exons were observed in 39.9% of the tumours. Full screening of exons 5-8, followed by sequencing, was successful in 135 cases, and 48 mutations altering the protein were detected in 39 cases (28.9%). TP53 mutations were slightly less common in the Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians stage IA than in IB/IC (P=0.05). No significant correlations with histological type, grade of differentiation, DNA ploidy status or age at diagnosis were found. TP53 protein accumulation analysed by immunohistochemistry was found in 32.6% of all tumours, and was a poor predictor of TP53 mutations with 56.4% sensitivity, 77.1% specificity, 50% positive predictive value and 81.3% negative predictive value. Neither TP53 mutations nor TP53 protein accumulation influenced the prognosis significantly in this group of patients",

    "Abstract": "The detailed molecular basis and determinants of in vivo tumour sensitivity to conventional anticancer agents remain unclear. We examined the cellular and molecular consequences of cisplatin treatment using two ovarian tumour xenograft models that had not been previously adapted to culture in vitro. Both xenografts were curable with clinically relevant multiple doses of cisplatin. Following a single dose of cisplatin (6 mg kg(-1) i.p.) growth delays of 25 and 75 days were obtained for pxn100 and pxn65, respectively. This difference in response was not due to differences in DNA damage. Pxn100 tumours had a functional p53 response and a wild-type p53 sequence, whereas pxn65 harboured a mutant p53 and lacked a functional p53 response. Microarray analysis revealed the induction of p53-regulated genes and regulators of checkpoint control and apoptosis in pxn100 tumours following cisplatin-treatment. By contrast, there was no p53-dependent response and only limited changes in gene expression were detected in the pxn65 tumours. TUNEL analysis demonstrated high levels of apoptosis in the pxn100 tumours following cisplatin treatment, but there was no detectable apoptosis in the pxn65 tumours. Our observations show that a marked in vivo response to cisplatin can occur via p53-dependent apoptosis or independently of p53 status in human ovarian xenografts",

    "Abstract": "p53 gene mutation is a very frequent event in many human cancers and is associated with a poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. Analysis of p53 gene mutations can also provide clues to the etiology of tumor formation. The present study was conducted to investigate the p53 mutations in patients with breast cancer from Taiwan. Tumor samples from 119 patients undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer were evaluated. The mutational status of the p53 gene (exons 5-8) was screened by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by direct sequencing. Of all 119 cases of breast carcinoma, 26 mutations of the p53 gene were found in 22 cases (18.5%). Among these mutations, 78% (20/26) were point mutations with the majority of those being missense mutations (75%, 15 of 20 mutations) and the other 22% (6/26) were frameshift mutations. No significant correlation between p53 mutations and clinicopathological features was found, including HER2 status. Moreover, our results disclosed distinct mutation spectra in excess transversions to transitions (15/21, 71.4% vs. 6/21, 28.6%) with GC to CG dominant (6/15, 40%). Mutation hot spots we identified at codons 167, 185, 186, 210, 265 and 295 have rarely been documented in the literature. These findings showed that p53 gene mutation might contribute to the pathogenesis of breast carcinoma. Furthermore, the different mutation spectrum with high transversions in G:C to C:G may imply that the exogenous mutagens outweigh the endogenous processes in breast cancer in patients in Taiwan",

In this study, we examined the expressions of p33ING1, p14ARF, MDM2 and p21WAF1 mRNA in 25 advanced colorectal cancers by quantitative RT-PCR method, and compared the expression levels of p33ING1, p14ARF, p21WAF1 and MDM2 in relation to p53 status in the tumors. Fifteen of 25 colorectal cancers (60%) showed abnormal accumulation of p53 protein in the nucleus, and the remaining 10 colorectal cancers (40%) were negative for p53 immunostaining. We found a G --> T transition (nonsense mutation) at the first nucleotide of codon 298 (exon 8) in one p53-negative case, and a frame shift mutation on exon 7 in another p53-negative case. In remaining eight p53-negative cases, there was no mutation in the entire open reading frame of p53 cDNA. Interestingly, in eight cases with p53 wild-type gene, 6 cases (75%) showed a marked down-regulation of p14ARF mRNA, and three cases (37.5%) over-expressed MDM2 mRNA. Only one case with wild-type p53 gene showed normal level expression of p53 regulatory-factors (p33ING1, p14ARF, and MDM2). Thus, p53 tumor suppressor pathway was disrupted in 24 of 25 colorectal cancers (96%)",

    "Title": "Inverse correlation of epidermal growth factor receptor messenger RNA induction and suppression of anchorage-independent growth by OSI-774, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in glioblastoma multiforme cell lines",
    "Abstract": "OBJECT: Quantitative and qualitative alterations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) commonly occur in many cancers in humans, including malignant gliomas. The aim of the current study was to evaluate molecular and cellular effects of OSI-774, a novel EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, on nine glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines. METHODS: The effects of OSI-774 on expression of EGFR messenger (m)RNA and protein, proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and apoptosis were examined using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemical analysis, Coulter counting, soft agar cloning, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling/fluorescence-activated cell sorting, respectively. All p53 genes were completely and bidirectionally sequenced. Suppression of anchorage-independent growth by OSI-774 was inversely correlated to the induction of EGFR mRNA during relative serum starvation (r = -0.74) and was unrelated to p53 status. Overall, suppression of anchorage-independent growth was a considerably stronger effect of OSI-774 than inhibition of proliferation. The extent of OSI-774-induced apoptosis positively correlated with both proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of GBM cell lines (r = 0.75 and 0.79, respectively). In a single cell line derived from a secondary GBM, exposure to concentrations of greater than or equal to 1 micromol/L resulted in a substantial net cell loss during proliferation studies. CONCLUSIONS: The induction of EGFR mRNA may constitute a cellular mechanism to counteract the inhibitory effect of OSI-774 on the anchorage-independent growth of GBM cells. In contrast, no considerable correlation could be established between baseline expression levels of EGFR (both mRNA and protein) in GBM cell lines and their biological response to OSI-774. The OSI-774 induced greater (p53-independent) apoptosis in more malignant GBM phenotypes and may be a promising therapeutic agent against secondary GBM",

    "Title": "Detection of p53 gene mutations in exhaled breath condensate of non-small cell lung cancer patients",
    "Abstract": "Early diagnosis of lung carcinoma is greatly desired. A potential source of early information regarding the process of cancerisation in the airways is exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The direct approach to detecting cancerisation is examining DNA from the area of chronic damage, i.e. airways and lung parenchyma. We therefore investigated DNA in EBC of patients with NSCLC and healthy volunteers. Human DNA was amplified by PCR in exhaled breath condensate and used to detect p53 mutations. A PCR of the beta-actin gene fragment was used to detect human DNA in each of the EBC samples. In 65.7% of the samples, the beta-actin gene was found. Extracted DNA as well as native EBC were equally suited as starting material for amplification. Mutations of the p53 gene were investigated in all EBC samples of NSCLC patients. p53 exons 5-8 were amplified using nested PCR and subsequently sequenced. Mutations were found in four of the patients (n=11; 36.4%) while no mutation was found in volunteers (n=10). Mutations detected in EBC were also compared with those of corresponding tumor tissue. Different point mutations in EBC and tumor tissue were revealed in all cases. Our findings demonstrate that exhaled breath condensate may be used for analysis of somatic gene mutations in an area of direct tobacco-related DNA damage",

    "Title": "TP53 mutations in squamous-cell carcinomas of the conjunctiva: evidence for UV-induced mutagenesis",
    "Abstract": "Squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva is associated with sun exposure and often occurs in HIV-positive individuals. We have analysed TP53 mutations in 21 cases of squamous cell carcinoma and 22 controls with benign conjunctival lesions from a region (Uganda, Africa) with a high prevalence of heavy sun exposure and HIV infection. TP53 mutations were detected in 11 cases (52%) and 3 controls (14%). Seven of the mutations (6 in cases and 1 in controls) were CC-->TT transitions, a molecular signature of mutagenesis by solar UV rays. A similar prevalence (56%) of TP53 mutations was found in 18 squamous cell carcinoma cases positive for epidermodysplasia verruciformis human papillomavirus types. The prevalence of CC-->TT transitions reported here is the highest observed in any cancer type and matches that of skin cancers in subjects with xeroderma pigmentosum, an inherited disease with hypersensitivity to UV damage. These results confirm at the molecular level the causal role of solar UV rays in the aetiology of squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and suggest that infection with epidermodysplasia verruciformis types of human papillomavirus may act as a cofactor to increase the sensitivity of conjunctiva cells to UV-induced mutagenesis",

    "Title": "Genetic and expression profiles of cerebellar liponeurocytomas",
    "Abstract": "Cerebellar liponeurocytoma, a rare, newly identified CNS neoplasm of adults, is characterized by advanced neuronal/neurocytic and focal lipomatous differentiation, low proliferative potential and a favorable clinical prognosis. Despite the different age distribution and benign biological behavior, the cerebellar liponeurocytoma shares several features with the cerebellar medulloblastoma, which may include an origin from the periventricular matrix of the fourth ventricle or the external granular layer of the cerebellum. To establish the genetic profile of cerebellar liponeurocytomas, we have formed an international consortium and collected tumor samples from 20 patients. DNA sequencing revealed TP53 missense mutations in 4 (20%) of 20 cerebellar liponeurocytomas, a frequency higher than in medulloblastomas. There was no case with PTCH, APC, or beta-catenin mutations, each of which may be present in subsets of medulloblastomas. Isochromosome 17q, a genetic hallmark of classic medulloblastomas, was not observed in any of the cases investigated by FISH analysis. cDNA array analyses were carried out on 4 cerebellar liponeurocytomas, 4 central neurocytomas, and 4 classic medulloblastomas. Cluster analysis of the cDNA expression data of 1176 genes grouped cerebellar liponeurocytomas close to central neurocytomas, but distinct from medulloblastomas. These results suggest cerebellar liponeurocytoma as a distinct tumor entity that is genetically different from medulloblastoma. Furthermore, the cDNA expression array data suggest a relationship to central neurocytomas, but the presence of TP53 mutations, which are absent in central neurocytomas, suggests that their genetic pathways are different",

    "Title": "Genetic analysis of the LKB1/STK11 gene in hepatocellular carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "The tumour suppressor gene, LKB1/STK11, has been mapped to chromosome 19p13, a region showing frequent allelic loss in various human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, LKB1 physically associates with p53 and regulates p53-dependent apoptotic pathways. To investigate whether genetic alterations of LKB1 could be involved in the tumorigenesis of HCC, we analysed the genetic alterations of the LKB1 and p53 genes in seven dysplastic nodules and 80 HCCs. We found one LKB1 missense mutation, CCG--&gt;CTG (Pro--&gt;Leu) at codon 281 within the kinase domain. We also found allelic loss in six of 27 (22%) informative HCC cases and all of them were HBV-positive cases. In addition, we detected seven missense, one nonsense and one silent mutations (nine of 80, 11%) of p53 in HCCs only. These results suggest that genetic alterations of the LKB1 or p53 genes may play an important role in tumour development or progression of a sub-set of HCCs, and may also provide alternative mechanisms to protect the HCC cell from p53-dependent apoptosis",

    "Title": "Mutation spectra of epidermal p53 clones adjacent to basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Foci of normal keratinocytes overexpressing p53 protein are frequently found in normal human skin. Such epidermal p53 clones are common in chronically sun-exposed skin and have been suggested to play a role in skin cancer development. In the present study, we have analyzed the prevalence of p53 mutations in epidermal p53 clones from normal skin surrounding basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Using laser-assisted microdissection, 37 epidermal p53 clones adjacent to BCC (21) and SCC (16) were collected. Genetic analysis was performed using a multiplex/nested polymerase chain reaction followed by direct DNA sequencing of p53 exons 2-11. In total, 21 of 37 analyzed p53 clones consisted of p53-mutated keratinocytes. The identified mutations were located in p53 exons 4-8, corresponding to the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain. All mutations were missense, and 78% displayed a typical ultraviolet signature. The frequency of p53 mutations was similar in skin adjacent to BCC compared to SCC. The presented data confirm and extend previous knowledge on the genetic background of epidermal p53 clones. The mutation spectra found in epidermal p53 clones resemble that of non-melanoma skin cancer. Approximately, 40% of the epidermal p53 clones lacked an underlying p53 mutation, suggesting that other genetic events in genes up- or downstream of the p53 gene can generate foci of normal keratinocytes overexpressing p53 protein",

    "Title": "Detecting lung cancer in plasma with the use of multiple genetic markers",
    "Abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility to detect genetic changes in plasma DNA of cancer patients. The goal of this study was to validate a panel of molecular markers for lung cancer detection in plasma DNA. Three markers, p53, FHIT and microsatellite alterations at loci on chromosome 3, were used to detect mutations in tumor and plasma DNA of 64 stage I-III non small cell lung cancer patients. p53 mutations were studied by direct sequencing of exons 5 through 8 in tumor DNA and by plaque hybridization assay and sequencing in plasma DNA. Allelic losses were evaluated by fluorescent PCR in tumor and plasma DNA. p53 genomic mutations were detected in 26 (40.6%) of 64 tumor DNA samples and the identical mutation was identified in plasma of 19 (73.1%) of them. Microsatellite alterations at FHIT and 3p loci were observed in 40 (62.5%) tumors and in 23 (35.9%) plasma samples. Of the 40 patients showing microsatellite alterations in tumors, 19 (47.5%) displayed the same change in plasma DNA. At least 1 of the 3 genetic markers (p53, FHIT and 3p) was altered in plasma of 51.6% of all patients and 60.7% of stage I patients. Moreover, genetic markers in plasma identified 29 of 45 (64.4%) of all stages and 15 of 22 (68.2%) of stage I patients whose tumors had an alteration. These results provide the proof of principle that plasma DNA alterations are tumor-specific in most cases and support blood testing as a noninvasive strategy for early detection",

    "Title": "Head and neck tumor sites differ in prevalence and spectrum of p53 alterations but these have limited prognostic value",
    "Abstract": "The tumor site is a strong clinical factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). To clarify the biologic and clinical role of p53 alterations in HNSCC, we have examined the prevalence and the nature of p53 alterations in a large cohort of tumors from the different sites. For immunohistochemical analysis of p53 protein expression, we introduced tyramide signal amplification immunohistochemistry (TSA-IHC) on a tissue microarray. This allowed the discrimination between normal low-level expression and reduced or lost expression. Two hundred fifty-three tumors were subjected to mutational analysis by genomic DNA sequencing, employing also the p53 GeneChip from Affymetrix. The prevalence of all p53 alterations, i.e., mutations, overexpression and loss of expression, was significantly higher in hypopharyngeal tumors than in the other sites (p = 0.001). Laryngeal tumors showed the lowest rate of p53 alterations, but revealed a distinct mutation spectrum: most mutations affected exon 5 (p = 0.013) and the S2' domain (p = 0.002), and most hot-spot 248 mutations occurred in the larynx (p < 0.001). Sequencing by p53GeneChip technology was shown to be only insignificantly more sensitive than dideoxy sequencing. In agreement with p53 mutations occurring prior to invasiveness, their prevalence did not increase with tumor stage, and all mutation classes lacked prognostic significance. The large patient cohort of this study showed that p53 is differentially affected in the different tumor sites of the head and neck, but its mode of inactivation does not play a major role in tumor progression",

    "Title": "Ser-249TP53 mutation in tumour and plasma DNA of hepatocellular carcinoma patients from a high incidence area in the Gambia, West Africa",
    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is frequent in areas of high exposure to aflatoxin and high prevalence of HBV infection, such as western Africa and south-east China. A selective mutation in TP53 (AGG-->AGT at codon 249, Arg-->Ser) has been identified as a hotspot in HCCs from such areas, reflecting DNA damage caused by aflatoxin metabolites. Recent studies have shown that circulating free DNA can be retrieved from human plasma, and it is hypothesised that plasma DNA may serve as a source for biomarkers of tumorigenic processes. In our study, we have determined the prevalence of Ser-249 mutation, using a PCR-restriction digestion method, with selective use of short oligonucleotide mass spectrometry analysis (SOMA), in a series of 29 biopsy specimens of HCC from The Gambia in West Africa. Overall, we identified the Ser-249 mutation in 35% (10/29) of the tumours. In parallel, we tested 17 plasma samples from HCC patients with matching tumour tissue. The 249 status concordance between tumour tissues and matched plasma was 88.5%. These results indicate that the Ser-249 mutation is common in HCC in The Gambia (35%), although a higher prevalence has been reported in other regions with high population exposure to aflatoxin (e.g., eastern China: >50%). Moreover, our studies indicate that plasma is a convenient source of liver tumour-derived DNA, thus holding promise for earlier detection and diagnosis of cancer",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the clinicopathologic significance and prognostic value of chromosomal imbalances in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have examined 64 tumors at diagnosis using comparative genomic hybridization and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-stranded conformational polymorphism, and DNA sequencing for the analysis of several potential target genes. RESULTS: The most recurrent alterations were gains of 18q (20%), Xq (15%), 2p, 7q, and 12p (14%), and losses of 6q and 17p (14%). Frequent high-level DNA amplifications were detected at 2p13-p16 and 18q21 loci. Real-time quantitative PCR detected REL and BCL11A gene amplifications in the nine patients with gains at 2p13-p16 and only in one additional patient with normal chromosome 2. Similarly, the BCL-2 gene was amplified in the 12 tumors with gains of 18q21 but in none of 39 patients with normal 18q profile. p53 gene inactivation was detected in nine of 58 (16%) tumors and was commonly associated with 17p losses. Tumors with 18q gains were significantly associated with a high number of chromosomal imbalances, primary nodal presentation, high serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, high International Prognostic Index, shorter cause-specific survival, and a high risk of relapse. Losses of 17p and p53 gene alterations were associated with an absence of complete response achievement. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that DLBCLs have a characteristic pattern of genomic alterations; 18q gains or amplifications and 17p losses are associated with particular clinicopathological features and aggressive clinical behavior. Additional studies are needed to confirm these observations in larger series of patients",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the role of TP53 status in predicting pathologic complete remission after primary chemotherapy in patients with ethmoidal intestinal-type adenocarcinoma (ITAC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with ethmoidal ITAC enrolled onto a phase II study received chemotherapy with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (PFL) followed by surgery and radiation. On surgical specimens, absence of viable tumor cells was defined as pathologic complete remission (pCR). TP53 status/p53 function, analyzed on pretreatment biopsies, were retrospectively correlated with pathologic results and patient outcome. RESULTS: Twelve patients achieved a pCR; 18 patients did not (overall response rate, 40%). In patients with wild-type (wt) TP53 or functional p53 protein, the pCRs were 83% and 80%, respectively; in patients with mutated TP53 or impaired p53 protein, pCRs were 11% and 0%, respectively (P < or = .0001). At a median 55-month follow-up, all pCR patients were disease-free; 44% of nonresponding patients experienced relapse (P = .0061). CONCLUSION: The results indicate the existence of two genetic ITAC subgroups, defined by differences in TP53 mutational status or protein functionality, that strongly influence pathologic response to primary chemotherapy and, ultimately, prognosis. PFL seems to be highly effective in terms of pCR and disease-free survival in the presence of a wt or a still-efficient p53 protein, even when encoded by a mutated TP53 gene (eg, early-stop codon mutation), but ineffective in ITACs carrying a disabled p53 protein. Whether this model is extensible to other head and neck cancers needs appropriate investigation",

    "Title": "Mutation and expression of the TP53 gene in early stage epithelial ovarian carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The early natural history of epithelial ovarian carcinoma remains poorly understood. Mutation of the TP53 gene is common in advanced-stage (III-IV) ovarian cancers, but less well described in early stage (I-II) tumors. The purpose of this study was to perform a comprehensive analysis of TP53 mutation and p53 expression status in early stage ovarian carcinomas. METHODS: Seventy-three cases of various histologic types, including 46 stage I and 27 stage II tumors, were subjected to direct sequence analysis of the entire TP53 coding region and exon-intron junctions as well as immunohistochemical assessment of p53 expression. RESULTS: Overall, mutations were identified in 24 of 73 (34%) cases. However, a significant difference in the distribution of mutations among histologic types was observed; TP53 mutations were present in 14 of 21 (67%) serous cancers and 11 of 52 (21%) non-serous cancers (P = 0.0002). Mutations were equally common between stage I and stage II tumors of serous histology. With respect to the correlation between TP53 mutation and p53 immunopositivity, the sensitivity (58%), specificity (71%), positive predictive value (64%), and negative predictive value (83%) were not sufficiently robust to justify use of p53 expression as a surrogate or screen for mutation. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that TP53 mutation is common in early stage ovarian carcinomas of serous histology, with a mutation frequency comparable to that reported for advanced-stage tumors, and is therefore likely to occur early in the progression of the most common histologic variant of ovarian carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Although the presence of p53 gene mutations has been considered as a bad prognostic feature in DLBCL, its clinical significance is still controversial. The aims of this study were: detect the presence of mutations in exons 5 to 9 of the p53 gene and correlate it to prognosis in DLBCL. Fifty-one DLBCL patients were enrolled in this study. Expression of p53 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The screening of p53 mutations was performed using PCR-SSCP methods. Cases showing a mobility shift on SSCP electrophoresis were analyzed by automatic sequencing. We could identify 8 missense mutations in 6 of 48 cases (12.5%). In addition, we found a known polymorphism at codon 213 and 2 instances of silent mutations. Of all mutations/polymorphisms found, 7 (64%) were localized in codons previously described as p53 hot spots in NHL cases. Of the remaining alterations (4 or 36%), 2 mutations were localized in codons previously described as hot spots for p53 in other tumors and 2 (codon 142 of the exon 5 and codon 195 of the exon 6), in codons not described as hot spots for p53 up to now. The presence of missense mutations in exons 5 to 9 of p53 gene had adverse impact on overall survival (P = 0.020). Cox's Regression Model identified that high-risk International Prognostic Index (IPI) and p53 gene mutations have independent negative impact on OS. Therefore, the association of IPI with cellular factors, such as p53 mutation, can be very helpful in deciding when we should indicate more aggressive therapies in patients with DLBCL, to somehow increase the chance of cure in these patients",

Immunostaining for p53 revealed strong positivity in both intraductal and sarcomatous components, but not in osteoclast-like giant cells. Mutational analysis of the p53 gene disclosed an identical point mutation in both intraductal and sarcomatous components, but not in osteoclast-like giant cells, indicating that both components share the same progenitor cells, and osteoclast-like giant cells represent a reactive infiltrate",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The survival of gallbladder cancer (GC) patients is generally poor. Both after resection and palliative procedures, additive therapy is often administered to increase outcome. The effect of cytotoxic therapies depends on a functioning p53 gene. The aim of this study was to investigate whether p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) or p53 gene sequencing are of any survival influence in GC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 61 GC patients, 19 were resected and in 42 operative explorations were performed. Seven resected and 14 palliated patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. IHC p53 staining and DNA sequencing was investigated. RESULTS: p53 sequencing detected 20 mutations and no relationship was found between IHC and sequencing results. After resection chemotherapy increased survival in those having a normal p53 gene compared to those having a mutation (p=0.008). p53 status did not show an influence in resected patients without chemotherapy or in palliative-treated patients regardless of their therapy. CONCLUSION: p53 protein overexpression does not correlate with p53 gene mutation. Response to chemotherapy in resected GC patients may depend on a functioning p53 gene",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer is a multi-step process characterized by a sequence of genetic alterations in cell growth regulatory genes, such as adenomatous polyposis coli, KRAS, p53 and DCC genes. In the present study, mutation analysis was performed with SSCA/direct sequencing of the hot-spot regions in exons 11 and 15 for the BRAF gene and exons 1-2 for the KRAS gene in 130 primary colorectal cancer tumors and correlated to clinico-pathological and mutational data. We also performed mutation analysis of the corresponding conserved regions in the ARAF and RAF-1 genes. Mutations in the BRAF and KRAS genes were found in 11.5% and 40% of the tumors, respectively. One germline exonic and nine germline intronic genetic variants were found in the ARAF and RAF-1 genes. All of the BRAF mutations were located in the kinase domain of the conserved region 3 in exon 15 of the BRAF gene. One novel somatic mutation was also identified in the BRAF gene. The majority of the BRAF mutations were found in the colon compared to rectal tumors (P=0.014). In agreement with others, a statistically significant correlation between BRAF mutations and microsatellite instability could be found. A negative correlation was also evident between mutations in the BRAF and KRAS genes which supports earlier studies where somatic mutations in these genes are mutually exclusive. Collectively, our results provide support for the idea that activation of the MAP kinase pathway, especially via BRAF and KRAS mutations, is of critical importance for the development of colorectal cancer",

    "Title": "Clinical implications of p53 mutation analysis in bladder cancer tissue and urine sediment by functional assay in yeast",
    "Abstract": "In the present study we correlate the p53 gene mutations in tumour tissue with urine sediment using a functional assay in yeast, and relate the p53 status to the outcome in a group of patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. The p53 mutations were found in three of 30 (10%) Ta/T1 tumour tissue samples and in two of 20 (10%) corresponding urine sediments. In the stage T2-T4 tumour p53 mutations were found in tumour tissues and urine sediments in 13 of 31 (42%) and in seven of 18 (39%) samples, respectively. In 80% (8/10) of cases, the p53 mutations found in tumour tissue were re-detected in urine sediment. Median follow-up was at 20 months. Disease recurred in 18 of the 61 patients (30%) with a median time of 5 months. In Ta/T1 tumours the frequency of recurrence was 37% (11/30) compared with 23% (7/31) of T2-T4 tumours. The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 82% (50/61). The p53 status was significantly associated with stage (P = 0.0077, two-sided Fisher's exact test), grade (P < 0.001) and lymph node involvement (P = 0.027). There was an association between the p53 mutations and shorter OS (P = 0.033; log-rank test); however in a multivariate analysis adjusted for stage, grade, lymph node status and age the p53 mutation was not an independent predictor of survival. There was no correlation of the p53 status with decreased disease-free survival (P = 0.8; log-rank test). The data presented indicate that the yeast functional assay is a useful method for p53 gene mutation analysis in tumour tissue and p53 mutation can be re-detected in urine sediment, but further validation of the assay in non-invasive screening for p53 mutations is needed",

    "Title": "TP53 in gastric cancer: mutations in the l3 loop and LSH motif DNA-binding domains of TP53 predict poor outcome",
    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to clarify whether specific p53 mutations may have biological relevance in terms of disease relapse or death in gastric carcinomas (GC). Resected specimens from a consecutive series of 62 patients with GC undergoing potentially curative surgery were prospectively studied. The mutational status of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene was investigated in 62 cases using the PCR-SSCP and sequencing. Presence of microsatellite instability (MSI) was evaluated in 56 cases by analyzing loci highly sensitive of MSI. Twenty mutations of p53 were detected in 17 of the 62 cases analyzed (27%). Ten mutations (50%) occurred in highly conserved domains. According to the p53 specific functional domains: 4/20 mutations (20%) were in the L3 loop and 3/20 (15%) in LSH motif. Eight of the 56 GC resulted MSI-H, 5 (9%) MSI-L, and 43 (77%) MSI stable (MSS). None of the 8 (14%) MSI-H GC showed p53 mutations. p53 mutations were associated with intestinal histotype. Moreover, specific mutations in functional domain (L3 and LSH), together with advanced TNM stage, node involvement, depth of invasion, diffuse histotype, proved to be significantly related to quicker relapse and to shorter overall survival. Specific mutations in p53 functional domains, rather than any mutations in this gene, may be biologically more significant in terms of patients outcome, indicating that these mutations might have biological relevance to identify subgroups of patients at higher risk of relapse or death who might benefit from a more aggressive therapeutic approach",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aristolochic acid-associated nephropathy (AAN) is a specific type of renal disease that predisposes patients to a high risk of urothelial carcinoma. The authors have analyzed DNA from a patient who had urothelial malignancy 6 years after presenting with AAN and later had a breast carcinoma that metastasized to the liver. METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA was isolated from the primary breast tumor, the liver tumor, and the original urothelial malignancy and assayed for aristolochic acid (AA)-DNA adducts and mutations in the p53 gene. The adduct detected was the adenosine adduct of aristolochic acid I 7-(deoxyadenosin-N6-yl)aristolactam I (dA-AAI). In DNA from the breast and liver tumors the authors showed the same missense mutation in codon 245 (GGC-->GAC; Gly-->Asp) of exon 7 of p53. In contrast, DNA extracted from the urothelial tumor showed an AAG to TAG mutation in codon 139 (Lys-->Stop) of exon 5. CONCLUSION: A to T transversions, as observed here, are the typical mutations observed in the H-ras gene of tumors induced when rodents are treated with AA and correspond with DNA adduct formation at adenosine residues. These data indicate the probable molecular mechanism whereby AA causes urothelial malignancy",

    "Title": "Rapid and sensitive p53 alteration analysis in biopsies from lung cancer patients using a functional assay and a universal oligonucleotide array: a prospective study",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Molecular profiling of alterations associated with lung cancer holds the promise to define clinical parameters such as response to treatment or survival. Because <5% of small cell lung cancers and <30% of non-small cell lung cancers are surgically resectable, molecular analysis will perforce rely on routinely available clinical samples such as biopsies. Identifying tumor mutations in such samples will require a sensitive and robust technology to overcome signal from excess amounts of normal DNA. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: p53 mutation status was assessed from the DNA and RNA of biopsies collected prospectively from 83 patients with lung cancer. Biopsies were obtained either by conventional bronchoscopy or computed tomography-guided percutaneous biopsy. Matched surgical specimens were available for 22 patients. Three assays were used: direct sequencing; a functional assay in yeast; and a newly developed PCR/ligase detection reaction/Universal DNA array assay. RESULTS: Using the functional assay, p53 mutation was found in 62% of biopsies and 64% of surgical specimens with a concordance of 80%. The sensitivity of the functional assay was determined to be 5%. Direct sequencing confirmed mutations in 92% of surgical specimens but in only 78% of biopsies. The DNA array confirmed 100% of mutations in both biopsies and surgical specimens. Using this newly developed DNA array, we demonstrate the feasibility of directly identifying p53 mutations in clinical samples containing <5% of tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility and sensitivity of this new array assay should allow additional development of mutation profiling arrays that could be applied to biological samples with a low tumor cell content such as bronchial aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or serum",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To allow the longitudinal investigation of molecular events associated with the progression of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we sought to develop a murine model by orthotopic implantation of tumor fragments obtained from patients diagnosed at early stage. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor pieces (2 x 2 mm) were implanted on the liver surface of nu/nu mice. After xenograft growing, subsequent passages were performed to achieve long-term implant viability. Isolation of tumoral hepatocytes was done to establish new cell lines. HCC characteristics, proliferation rate, apoptotic index (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling), and expression of cell-cycle regulators (cyclins E and A, p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1), p16(INK4a), pRb, and p53) were assessed by Western Blot and immunohistochemistry, to correlate them with tumor progression. RESULTS: Five (50%) of the 10 primary HCCs resulted in small slow-growing liver implants. Three of them are viable after 48 months, whereas the remaining two survived for 15 and 13 months. Xenografts throughout passages exhibited a more aggressive phenotype with a poorer degree of differentiation, intense proliferation, moderate apoptosis, cell-cycle deregulation, p53 alterations, microvascular invasion, and dissemination. In one single passage, we observed critical growth delay, which was associated with significant p27(kip1) overexpression. We established the anchor-free growing BCLC-9 cell line from one xenograft. This has gains of chromosomes 7, 5p, 6q, and 9q, is hepatitis B virus-DNA positive, does not secrete alpha-fetoprotein, and has TP53 missense mutations in codons 192 and 242. CONCLUSIONS: The orthotopic implantation of early HCC fragments in nude mice provides a useful model to investigate the mechanisms of human HCC evolution and to establish new cell lines",

    "Title": "Genetic analysis of radiation-associated rectal cancer",
    "Abstract": "Genetic aberrations in radiation-associated colorectal cancer have not been studied in detail. We analyzed genetic aberrations in five rectal cancers that developed long after radiotherapy had been performed for cervical cancer. Microsatellite instability (MSI) in tumors was examined at five loci: D2S123, D3S966, TP53, DCC, and BAT26. Mutation of simple repeat sequences within the hMSH3, BAX, and transforming growth factor Beta type II receptor ( TGFBetaRII) genes was examined by polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). Mutation of p53 exons 5-8 was examined by PCR-SSP and direct sequencing. Mutations of the K- ras gene were analyzed by two-step PCR. No MSI was found in tumor specimens at any of the loci examined, and no mutations in the target genes were observed. K- ras mutation was detected in two carcinomas, but not in their irradiated normal mucosa, while p53 mutation was observed in another two carcinomas, but not in their irradiated normal mucosa. Our results suggest that the radiation-associated rectal carcinomas examined in this study did not develop through the mutator phenotype pathway; rather, tumorigenesis was probably mediated through the multistep carcinogenesis pathway",

    "Title": "Correlation between clinical characteristics and mitochondrial D-loop DNA mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are found in many kinds of human cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between mtDNA mutations in the liver and human hepatocarcinogenesis. METHODS: Direct sequencing of mtDNA was done in 54 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and 47 surrounding liver tissue samples, obtained from 54 patients with HCC, and in 5 liver samples without inflammation, obtained from 5 patients with metastatic liver tumors. We also examined p53 mutations in the 54 HCCs to examine the correlation between nuclear DNA mutations and mtDNA mutations. RESULTS: Mutations of mtDNA in the D-loop region were found in both HCC and noncancerous liver tissue. In normal liver without chronic inflammation, no mtDNA mutation was detected. In every case, the number of mtDNA mutations in HCC correlated with that in noncancerous liver tissue. Twelve of 52 mutation sites in the D-loop region of mtDNA were specific for HCC. The mean number of mtDNA mutations was 1.7 in well-differentiated HCC, as compared with 4.5 in moderately differentiated HCC and 4.6 in poorly differentiated HCC. The frequency of mtDNA mutations was thus higher in less differentiated HCC. We detected p53 mutations in 15 (28%) of 54 HCCs. The mean number of mtDNA mutations was 5.3 in HCC with p53 mutations and 3.8 in HCC with wild-type p53 (P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: A higher frequency of mtDNA mutations was found in less differentiated HCCs, and it is also possible that mtDNA mutations are related to nuclear DNA mutations in HCC. The accumulation of mtDNA mutations is a useful predictor of hepatocarcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Relationship between genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP2E1, GSTM1, and NAT2), drinking habits, histological subtypes, and p53 gene point mutations in Japanese patients with gastric cancer",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes have recently been shown to affect susceptibility to chemical carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms of individual susceptibility to gastric cancer have not been fully understood. Therefore, we studied the relationship between the genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes, drinking habits, histological subtypes, and p53 gene point mutations in Japanese patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: The genotypes of cytochromes P450 ( CYP) 1A1 and 2E1, glutathione S-transferase ( GST) M1, and N-acetyltransferase ( NAT) were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), allele-specific PCR, or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) following PCR in 146 Japanese patients with gastric cancer (67 intestinal-type and 79 diffuse-type carcinomas) and 177 autopsied controls. In addition, p53 gene point mutations of exons 5 through 9 in gastric cancer tissues were determined. RESULTS: The frequency of either being a habitual drinker or having a CYP2E1(*) 1A/(*) 1A genotype was significantly higher in patients with intestinal-type gastric cancer than in control subjects. The difference between the frequencies of habitual drinkers with the CYP2E1(*) 1A/(*) 1A genotype and non-drinkers with the CYP2E1(*) 5B allele was much more significant in the intestinal-type cancer versus the control group. Among intestinal-type cancer patients with the CYP2E1(*) 1A/(*) 1A genotype, p53 point mutations were significantly more frequent in the group of habitual drinkers than in that of non-drinkers. On the other hand, the combination of GSTM1 null and CYP2E1(*) 1A/(*) 1A genotypes increased the risk for diffuse-type gastric cancer, but had no influence on the frequency of p53 gene mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that individuals with both the CYP2E1(*) 1A/(*) 1A genotype and a history of habitual drinking have an increased risk of intestinal-type gastric cancer with a high frequency of p53 gene point mutations in the gastric mucosa",

    "Title": "Do collision tumors of the gastroesophageal junction exist? A molecular analysis",
    "Abstract": "Collision tumors are thought to arise from the accidental meeting of two independent tumors. Here we present five gastroesophageal junction tumors consisting of two collision tumors and three composite tumors (characterized by two divergent lineages originating from the same neoplastic clonal proliferation), as diagnosed on histology. In an attempt to prove this distinction at a genetic level, we performed TP53 sequence analysis and p53 immunohistochemistry. In addition, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis using 10 microsatellite markers was carried out. An identical TP53 mutation and a similar pattern of retention and LOH were found in both neoplastic components of the presumed collision tumors, suggesting that both components are derived from a single precursor cell that undergoes divergent differentiation in the evolution of the tumor. In the composite group, 1 case had a genetic basis for the possible diagnosis of a collision tumor, with a TP53 mutation in the adenocarcinoma component only, and a different pattern of retention and loss of heterozygosity. These findings imply that it is not possible to recognize true collision tumors from immunohistologic appearance alone and suggest that the long-standing histologic criteria for the diagnosis of these neoplasms have no molecular basis",

    "Abstract": "Tumor-associated DNA has been detected in plasma of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients using various techniques but with limited gene or mutation coverage. We report a highly sensitive scanning methodology for mutational assessment of the APC and TP53 genes, which typically pose an analytical challenge because of their significant genotypic heterogeneity as well as specific mutational scoring assays for K-RAS and BRAF. Plasma DNA isolated from 20 CRC patients were scanned for mutations in these targets without knowledge of the molecular or pathological analyses of the matched primary tumors. We chose mutation scanning technology and these molecular targets to provide a comprehensive screen for somatic mutations known to be associated with sporadic CRC. Mutations were identified with a novel denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) platform that uses post-separation fluorescence technology to enable the detection of variants that represent <0.1% of the total analyzed DNA. Mutant allele specific amplification (MASA) followed by detection with the same platform was used to identify low-level target mutations (mutation scoring) in K-RAS codons 12, 13, and 61, and BRAF codon 599. Using this combined scanning and scoring approach, we were able to identify at least one mutational event in 20/20 (100%) CRC patients. The thoroughness of a mutation scanning and scoring panel may have important implications for CRC screening and disease monitoring during and following therapy",

    "Abstract": "Rare examples of high-grade gliomas show focal epithelial differentiation, which may require distinction from colliision tumors. These epithelial constituents are not well-characterized immunophenotypically and have rarely been subjected to genotyping. We describe a case of a 54-year-old female with a short history of hemiparesis who was found to have an absolute lymphocytosis and a heterogeneously enhancing frontotemporal tumor. Cytological and histological examination of brain biopsies confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma multiforme also containing CAM5.2/CK7/BerEP4/CEA/EMA-immunopositive and GFAP-immunonegative nests of epithelial cells with a high proliferative index and focal glandular differentiation. Hematological investigations confirmed a diagn of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with no demonstrable CNS involvement. Genetic analysis using microsatellite markers and specimens obtained by laser capture microdissection of the CNS tumor and normal brain tissue, showed that both the glial and epithelial components of the brain tumor had identical losses of 2/2 informative markers on chromosome 17p13 and 5/5 informative markers on chromosome 10q22-26. The glial and epithelial components also shared an identical 2 base pair deletion in the TP53 gene at codon 209, exon 6, introducing a stop codon at codon 214. No losses at any of the above loci and no TP53 mutation were detected in the leukemic cells. These results suggest both components of the brain tumor, although differing in phenotype, share the same genetic lineage",

    "Title": "Genetic and immunophenotype analyses of TP53 in bladder cancer: TP53 alterations are associated with tumor progression",
    "Abstract": "Altered p53 status is a frequent event in bladder cancer and reported to have prognostic significance. We studied the TP53 gene and its product in 76 patients affected with urinary bladder carcinomas by immunohistochemistry (mAb DO-7), polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformational polymorphism (exons 4-8) followed by direct sequencing of shifted bands, and loss of heterozygosity in 17p (p53CA). H-RAS mutations were also studied. The receiver operating characteristic curve and the logistic-regression analysis were used to evaluate the validity of immunohistochemistry in predicting TP53 mutations. A p53-positive nuclear phenotype was defined by a cutoff of 20% tumor cells being immunoreactive and was found in 23 cases, while TP53 mutations were detected in 22 cases, four of them with a negative p53 phenotype. TP53 deletions were identified in 23 cases. No H-RAS gene mutations were observed. There was a significant association between phenotype and genotype results. Moreover, a significant association was observed between p53 status and tumor stage and grade, being alterations more common in high-stage and high-grade tumors (both chi2 test; P < .01). Deletion of 17p significantly correlated with tumor stage (P < .01) and grade (P = .01), allelic losses being more common in advanced disease. Data from these studies suggest that genetic assays are necessary for the optimal determination of TP53 alterations, mainly in tumors with a p53 negative phenotype, and especially in early stage tumors for which p53 status may assist in determining its progression to invasive disease. Since p53 alterations are significantly associated to clinicopathological features of poor prognosis, the inclusion of both p53 phenotype and TP53 mutation status into a predictive panel of tumor markers for bladder cancer is recommended",

    "Abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) displays complex karyotypes with numerical changes as well as structural abnormalities suggesting that several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes may be implicated in the biology of OS. The aim of our study was to investigate the possible implication of the molecular alterations of the G1 to S-phase checkpoint genes in the pathogenesis of OS. We analyzed samples from 29 patients and found molecular alterations of the RB and TP53 genes in 6 (21%) and 3 (10%) cases, respectively. Homozygous deletion of the INK4A/ARF locus and methylation of INK4A was detected in 3 (10%) and 2 (7%) cases, respectively. CDK4 and MDM2 co-amplification was observed in 1 case (3%). Cyclin D3 is differentially expressed in a greater proportion than D1- and D2-type cyclins. Cytogenetically, all cases had complex karyotypes being especially significant the losses of the chromosomes 4, 13, and 17. As a whole, 11 of 29 (38%) analyzed OS presented alterations in some of the analyzed G1 to S-phase checkpoint genes. These alterations were more frequently present in adults (P = 0.032). All patients with genetic alterations in the G1/S-phase checkpoint died during their clinical follow-up, whereas more than 53% of the remaining cases were alive in this period (P = 0.007). Hence, in the pathogenesis of human OS, deregulation of the G1/S checkpoint genes, especially RB, TP53, and INK4/ARF locus, plays an important role and defines a subgroup of patients with a poor outcome",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) is a ubiquitous zinc finger tumor suppressor that is often mutated in prostate cancer. Our aims were to establish the frequency of KLF6 inactivation in sporadic and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated colorectal cancers (CRC); to correlate these abnormalities with mutation and/or loss of TP53, APC, and K-RAS; and to characterize the behavior of mutant KLF6 in colon-derived cell lines. METHODS: We analyzed DNA isolated from 50 microdissected CRC cases, including 35 sporadic and 15 IBD-associated tumors. Microsatellite analysis and direct sequencing were used to establish the incidence of microsatellite instability, KLF6 and TP53 allelic imbalance, and KLF6, K-RAS, TP53, and APC mutation. Loss of growth suppressive function of the CRC-derived KLF6 mutants was characterized by in vitro thymidine incorporation assays and Western blotting. RESULTS: KLF6 was inactivated by loss and/or mutation in most sporadic and IBD-related CRCs. The KLF6 locus was deleted in at least 55% of tumors, and mutations were identified in 44%. Rates of KLF6 loss and mutation were similar to those of TP53 and K-RAS in the same samples. KLF6 mutations were present in tumors with either microsatellite or chromosomal instability and were more common, particularly in the IBD-related cancers, in the presence of wild-type APC. Unlike wild-type KLF6, cancer-derived KLF6 mutants neither suppressed growth nor induced p21 following transfection into cultured cells. CONCLUSIONS: Deregulation of KLF6 by a combination of allelic imbalance and mutation may play a role in the development of CRC",

    "Abstract": "Hyperdiploidy of > or =58 chromosomes is reported in 0.5-3% of hematological malignancies, but reports of near-triploidy (58-80 chromosomes) and near-tetraploidy (81-103 chromosomes), are few. We examined these chromosome abnormalities and analyzed the relationship with the mutation of the p53 gene. Thirty-one of 979 adult patients (3.2%) with hematological malignancies were identified as having near-triploid or near-tetraploid (tri-/tetraploid) chromosomes. These included 11 with B-cell neoplasms, seven with Hodgkin's lymphoma, five with T-cell neoplasms, four with myelodysplastic syndromes and four with acute myeloid leukemias. All patients had concurrent complex chromosome aberrations. Deletion of one allele of the p53 gene was found in two patients and a point mutation of the p53 gene was detected in five patients. Although abnormalities of the p53 gene have been reported in about 10% of hematological malignancies, these were found in seven of 31 (23%) patients with tri-/tetraploidy. These findings suggest that the abnormality of the p53 gene may be closely related with tri-/tetraploidy. The four myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with tri-/tetraploidy had a significantly worse prognosis than those with diploid cytogenetics (n = 35; P < 0.002). In B-cell neoplasms (n = 3), triploidy was associated with a worse prognosis than tetraploidy (n = 8) and diploidy (n = 130; P < 0.02)",

    "Title": "The ultraviolet fingerprint dominates the mutational spectrum of the p53 and Ha-ras genes in psoralen + ultraviolet A keratoses from psoriasis patients",
    "Abstract": "Psoriasis patients exposed to high cumulative doses of psoralen + ultraviolet A frequently exhibit so-called 'psoralen + ultraviolet A keratoses' (i.e., hyperkeratotic lesions with varying degrees of histologic atypia). The exact causes and molecular mechanisms of psoralen + ultraviolet A keratoses however, are not clear. We therefore performed DNA mutational analysis of the tumor suppressor gene p53 (exons in psoralen + ultraviolet A keratoses from 10 long-term psoralen + ultraviolet A-treated psoriasis patients. We detected 39 p53 mutations in 16 of 28 psoralen + ultraviolet A keratoses (57%) and 18 Ha-ras mutations in 11 of 25 psoralen + ultraviolet A keratoses (44%). Of the 39 p53 mutations and 18 Ha-ras mutations, 22 (56%) and 13 (72%), respectively, were of the ultraviolet fingerprint type (C-->T or CC-->TT transitions at dipyrimidine sites); 13 (33%) and two (11%), respectively, occurred at potential psoralen-binding sites (5'-TpA, 5'-TpG, or 5'-TpT DNA sequences) and were potentially psoralen + ultraviolet A induced; two (5%) and three (17%), respectively, were of ambiguous origin (ultraviolet and/or psoralen + ultraviolet A); and two (5%) and none (0%), respectively, were of the 'other' type, respectively. We conclude that (1) the frequent mutation of p53 and Ha-ras may play a key part in the formation of at least some psoralen + ultraviolet A keratoses; (2) environmental and/or therapeutic ultraviolet exposure may be a major cause of psoralen + ultraviolet A keratosis as most Ha-ras and p53 mutations are induced by ultraviolet light; and (3) psoralen + ultraviolet A itself plays a smaller, though direct, role in causing these mutations",

    "Abstract": "Uterine papillary serous adenocarcinoma (UPSC) is an uncommon histologic subtype of endometrial cancer that characteristically behaves aggressively with a poor prognosis. We established two novel cell lines derived from UPSC designated HEC-155 and HEC-180. Both cell lines have been growing steadily in monolayer cultures for over ten years. Overexpression of p53, Ki67 and p27 was detected in both cell lines by immunohistochemistry. Using a DNA sequencing technique, a point mutation of p53 was detected in exon 8, codon 286 in HEC-155 and in exon 6, codon 195 in HEC-180. These newly established cell lines should be useful for investigating the characteristics of UPSC",

    "Title": "Quantitative study on the correlation between p53 gene mutation and its expression in endometrial carcinoma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Mutant p53 protein is not degradated but accumulates in the nuclei. However, the relation between p53 gene mutation and quantity of p53 protein has not been clarified yet in endometrial carcinoma. We investigated the correlation between p53 gene mutation and its protein expression quantitatively using 11 cell lines of endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type and two serous-type cell lines. To examine p53 mutation, PCR-SSCP analysis in exon 5 to 8 and direct sequence were carried out. p53 expression was determined by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting. The percentage of positive staining in the nuclei by immunocytochemistry was calculated as a labeling index (LI). The amount of p53 detected by immunoblotting was expressed as a comparative value of Ishikawa cells. Point mutation of p53 gene was detected in four of 11 (36.4%) cell lines of endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and all two of serous adenocarcinoma. There was a significant positive correlation between p53 LI and p53 values. The LI and the values of p53 were significantly higher in the mutant group than the wild one, thus showing a quantitative correlation between p53 protein expression and p53 gene mutation in endometrial carcinoma cell lines. It is plausible that immunohistochemical analysis of p53 could be qualified to be a convenient indicator of p53 gene mutation on clinical materials, if p53 LI is more than 40 (M-SD in mutant p53)",

    "Abstract": "Mutation of p53 is one of the most common genetic abnormalities detected in up to 81% of cases of ovarian cancer. To evaluate the use of plasma DNA analysis as a method for somatic mutation screening, we measured the presence of p53 mutations in DNA isolated from plasma and cancer tissue from patients with ovarian cancer. We analyzed the plasma DNA for the presence of p53 mutations (exons 5-8). Of 27 cases of ovarian cancer, 12 cases (44%) had mutations of p53 in cancer tissue. In two of the 12 cases (16.7%), identical mutations were detected in DNA of their preoperative plasma. In our follow-up of the two patients with p53 mutations in their plasma, mutant DNA was undetectable in their plasma after surgery. In one case, the p53 mutation re-surfaced in their plasma 16 months after surgery, and the patient died 2 months later. We have shown that tumor-derived DNA can be detected in the plasma of some patients with ovarian cancer, particularly in those with more advanced stage",

    "Title": "Small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the uterine cervix: a histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic study",
    "Abstract": "Small cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix are rare tumors with an aggressive behavior. Although these tumors can exhibit neuroendocrine differentiation, the criteria for neuroendocrine differentiation are subjective and not well defined. In this study, the authors tentatively defined small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC) as a tumor composed of small cells with at least two of the following: argyrophilic cytoplasm, chromogranin A immunoreactivity, and synaptophysin immunoreactivity. We found 10 cases fulfilling these requirements. Five of the 10 tumors were composed mainly of small ('oat') cells and 5 of mainly larger 'intermediate' cells. The majority of both subtypes showed an insular pattern. Three of the 10 SCNECs were pure, whereas the other seven were mixed with adenocarcinoma and/or squamous cell carcinoma or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. In addition to the definitional markers noted earlier, the tumors were immunoreactive for serotonin (6 cases), somatostatin, gastrin, glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide. No tumors were immunoreactive for cytokeratin 20. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-18 was detected in all of the pure tumors and both the SCNEC and adenocarcinomatous components in four of the mixed tumors. No other types of HPV were detected. The tumors showed a relatively low frequency of loss of heterozygosity for representative tumor suppressor gene sites; p53 mutations were found in only one case",

    "Abstract": "Tumor suppressor gene p53 is one of the most specific genetic alterations occurring in osteosarcoma pathogenesis. It is thought to be an early and key step in the tumorigenesis of osteosarcoma. However, whether the p53 status is a marker predictive of response to therapy and a marker of prognostic value remains controversial. The choice of p53 status detection method certainly account for discrepancies. The authors used a simple functional assay (functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast) on the tumor sample of an 8-year-old girl presenting with an osteosarcoma of the tibia. While making it possible to exclude the presence of a germline mutation, FASAY indicated the presence of a somatic p53 mutation lacking transcriptional activity on p21 and bax target genes. FASAY also strongly suggested a loss of heterozygosity p53, which was confirmed by cytogenetic analysis. Sequencing of cDNA extracted from yeast colonies containing mutated p53 identified a 213 stop mutation in exon 6. Despite these p53 alterations, the child is still in complete remission after a follow-up of 48 months",

    "Title": "Association of p53 tumor suppressor gene with paraclinical and clinical modalities of gliomas patients in Malaysia",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alteration of the tumor suppressor gene p53 is considered to be a critical step in the development of human cancer. Changes in this gene have been detected in a wide range of human tumours, including gliomas. In glioma, the presence of p53 gene alterations has been associated with worse prognosis. METHODS: Forty-seven Malaysian adult glioma patients of the Malay race were prospectively studied over a period of 3 years where the presence of p53 mutation using cold-SSCP method and their clinical and paraclinical response were correlated. FINDINGS: Among these glioma patients, p53 mutations were detected in 12 tumors, an incidence rate of 25.5%. Mutations were found in 2 patients of grade II, and 5 patients both in grade III and grade IV. The sequencing results revealed the presence of base-substitutions (7) (58.3%) and frameshifts mutations (5) (41.7%). Of the base-substitutions, 57.1% were transversions and 42.9% were transitions. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis shows that 3 factors were associated with p53 mutations i.e. grade, site and consistency of tumour using univariate analysis although multivariate analysis revealed no positive on predictors of mutation. In conclusion, although p53 genetic alterations are involved in glioma patients in Malaysia, it has no impact on prognosis",

    "Title": "Chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization abnormalities in early- and late-onset human breast cancers: correlation with disease progression and TP53 mutations",
    "Abstract": "Nearly 30% of the breast cancer patients in the Taiwanese community have their diseases diagnosed before the age of 40. Their 5-year survival rate is poorer than that of their late-onset breast cancer counterparts. Genomic abnormalities between these two breast cancer age groups were compared using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses. The sample set was made up of 44 early-onset (&lt;35 years old) and 54 late-onset cases (&gt;63 years old). Frequent CGH changes were noted, such as gains on 8q, 1q, and 17q and losses on 16q, 17p, and 8p. These were very similar for the two age groups, as well as for Taiwanese women and other ethnic populations. In contrast, several less common lesions, such as gains on 16p and 8p and losses on 11q and 9p, were significantly different between the early- and late-onset breast tumors. In addition, more profound chromosomal changes were consistently associated with the more advanced-stage tumors, and less expression of the estrogen and the progesterone receptors, and of HER-2/neu. About 19% of the breast cancers examined carried a TP53 mutation in exons 4-9. Of these, 88% (15/17) were missense point mutations and these were distributed randomly along the tested gene fragments without apparent clustering, as has been shown in certain other ethnic or regional studies. On average, patients carrying these TP53 mutations had 9.5 CGH lesions per case, compared to only 2.8 changes in samples that had no TP53 mutation. Our results indicate that certain genomic lesions, especially 11q loss, may play a role in early-onset breast tumor formation, and that combined use of genomic patterns and molecular targets may provide a useful tool for diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic purposes",

    "Abstract": "We have performed a cytogenetic analysis of 23 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with complex karyotypes (CK) using GTG-banding and spectral karyotyping techniques. Fifty-five percent of cases were hypodiploid, 34% were hyperdiploid, and 11% were pseudodiploid. The most recurrent alterations were monosomy of chromosomes 18, 5, and 7; trisomy of chromosome 8; and deletion of 5q, 11q, and 12p. Ninety-two structural alterations were mostly identified as unbalanced. The chromosomes and regions more frequently affected were 16q12, 17p11, and 20q11. Eight of 92 structural alterations were reciprocal translocations. Two translocations were recurrent, t(X;20)(p11.4;q11.2) and der(17)t(5;17)(?;p11.2); each one was present in about 10% of cases (2 cases, t[X:20] and 3 cases, t[5:17]). Mutations of TP53 were observed in five cases (22%), all with rearrangements affecting 17p. Total or partial inactivation of TP53 was detected in six cases (26%) as a result of loss of either both copies (four cases) or just one copy (two cases). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed amplification of genes previously identified in myeloid and/or hematological processes, such as HER2neu, MLL, and AML1, which could represent frequent events in MDS with CK",

    "Title": "Acquisition of i(8q) as an early event in malignant triton tumors",
    "Abstract": "Malignant triton tumors (MTT) are rare soft-tissue tumors characterized by a mixture of cells with nerve sheath and skeletal muscle differentiation. MTT is a histological variant of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). No characteristic cytogenetic anomaly has been detected in MPNST or MTT. In this paper, we report on the cytogenetic findings of an MTT from a 20-year old male with neurofibromatosis (NF1). The tumoral karyotype showed the modal number to be near-diploid and an abnormal karyotype with a Robertsonian translocation and 4 markers: 49,XY,der(14;15)(q10;q10),+4mar. Spectral karyotyping revealed the karyotype: 49,XY, der(14;15)(q10;q10),+i(8)(q10)x4. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of the tissue confirmed the presence of the additional i(8)(q10) in all tumoral cells. The sequence analysis of p53 revealed a polymorphism in exon 9, codon 329. The two alleles, TTC and TCC, codify for phenylalanine and serine, respectively. Our results indicate that all neoplastic cells have the same cytogenetic pattern, suggesting that both cell lines, which show nerve sheath and skeletal muscle differentiation, are derived from a unique stem cell. The acquired Robertsonian chromosomal recombinants might represent an event in the tumorigenesis of MTT, and the present data suggest that genes located on 8q can be involved in the development of MTT",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for more than 80% of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. p53 tumor suppressor gene that controls cellular growth and differentiation is also known to be mutated in more than 50% of human cancers including breast cancer. We have carried out a study on BRCA1 and BRCA2 along with p53 gene mutations in both sporadic as well as familial breast cancer patients from India where breast cancer is fast emerging as a major cancer among premenopausal urban women. We examined 124 untreated primary breast cancer patients comprising 100 sporadic and 24 familial cases including 56 age-matched healthy controls for the presence of BRCA1, BRCA2 and the p53 gene mutations using PCR-SSCP and direct nucleotide sequencing. Certain frequently mutated exons such as 2, 5, 11, 13 and 20 of BRCA1, exons 2, 9, 11 (for 6174delT), 18 and 20 of BRCA2 and 4-9 exons of p53 gene were analyzed in sporadic breast cancer while all 22 coding exons of BRCA1 including its flanking intronic regions along with above mentioned exons of BRCA2 and p53 gene were analyzed in familial breast cancer patients. We identified six patients (25%) with BRCA1 mutation of which three were found to be of novel type one in exon 16 (4956insG) and two in exon 7 (Lys110Thr) (Ser114Pro) out of 24 familial breast cancer patients studied from two different geographic regions/populations of India. Two sisters from a single family (12.5%) out of eight families from Goa with Portuguese colonial origin showed presence of founder Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1 mutation (185delAG) along with (IVS7 561-34T>C; IVS18 5271 + 66G > A). While from New Delhi, four (25%) of 16 breast cancer families showed BRCA1 mutations; a frame shift protein truncating (4956insG), a transition nonsense (Gln1395Stop) and two amino acid substitutions (Lys110Thr) and (Ser114Pro). Only one (4%) p53 mutation (Val97Ile) in its exon 4 along with BRCA1 mutation (4956insG) could be detected. No major sequence variation in BRCA2 gene was observed except for G203A at 5' UTR of exon 2, a common population polymorphism in two Goan patients who also showed silent nucleotide change for amino acid serine at codon 1436 of BRCA1 gene. None of the 100 sporadic breast cancer patients revealed any protein truncating or deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. Interestingly, three (3%) p53 mutations in its exon 5 were detected in sporadic breast cancer patients. Although three novel BRCA1 mutations including a founder Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1 mutation were recorded in Indian women with familial breast cancer, the overall prevalence of BRCA gene mutations in Indian women with a family history of breast cancer appears to be low",

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass lesion in the right frontal lobe with diffuse high intensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. A few small lesions were enhanced by gadolinium on the T1-weighted images. Histological examination revealed the brain neoplasm was astrocytoma grade III according to the World Health Organization classification. Molecular genetic analysis detected microsatellite instability and p53 mutation only in the tumor tissue, indicating a failure of the deoxyribonucleic acid mismatch repair system. These results suggest that inactivation of mismatch repair system and p53 is closely associated with the tumorigenesis of this neoplasm. The final diagnosis was Turcot syndrome type 1",

    "Abstract": "We carried out a population-based study on low-grade diffuse gliomas in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (population 1.16 million). From 1980 to 1994, 987 astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors were diagnosed, of which 122 (12.4%) were low-grade (WHO grade II). The incidence rates adjusted to the World Standard Population, per million population per year, were 2.28 for low-grade diffuse astrocytomas, 0.89 for oligoastrocytomas, and 2.45 for oligodendrogliomas. The survival rate (mean follow-up 7.5+/-4.8 years) was highest for patients with oligodendroglioma (78% at 5 years, 51% at 10 years), followed by those with oligoastrocytoma (70% at 5 years, 49% at 10 years) and fibrillary astrocytoma (65% at 5 years, 31% at 10 years). Survival of patients with gemistocytic astrocytoma was poor, with survival rates of 16% at 5 years and 0% at 10 years. Younger patients (<50 years) survived significantly longer than older patients (>50 years; P=0.013). DNA sequencing, performed in 84% of cases, revealed that TP53 mutations were most frequent in gemistocytic astrocytomas (88%), followed by fibrillary astrocytomas (53%) and oligoastrocytomas (44%), but were infrequent (13%) in oligodendrogliomas. The presence of TP53 mutations was associated with shorter survival of patients with low-grade diffuse gliomas (log-rank test; P=0.047), but when each histological type was analyzed separately, an association was observed only for oligoastrocytoma ( P=0.05). Loss on 1p and 19q were assessed by quantitative microsatellite analysis in 67% of cases. These alterations were frequent in oligodendrogliomas (1p, 57%; 19q, 69%), less common in oligoastrocytomas (1p, 27%; 19q, 45%), rare in fibrillary astrocytomas (1p, 7%; 19q, 7%), and absent in gemistocytic astrocytomas. None of these alterations were predictive of survival. These results establish the frequency of key genetic alterations in low-grade diffuse gliomas at a population-based level. Multivariate Cox's regression analysis indicates that only age and histological type, but not genetic alterations, are significant predictive factors",

    "Abstract": "Oncogenic mutations in the KRAS2, NRAS, or FLT3 gene are detected in more than 50% of patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RAS mutations are also prevalent in de novo myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), especially chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. However, few studies have examined these genetic lesions in therapy-related myeloid malignancies. Monosomy 7/del(7q) and monosomy 5/del(5q) represent the most common cytogenetic abnormalities in therapy-related MDS and AML (t-MDS/t-AML) and are strongly associated with prior exposure to alkylating agents. Mutational analysis of bone marrow specimens from a well-characterized cohort of 26 t-MDS/t-AML patients with abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 revealed 3 with RAS mutations. Further analyses of 23 of these cases uncovered one FLT3 internal tandem duplication and five TP53 mutations. The four patients with RAS or FLT3 mutations had monosomy 7, including one with abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and 7. One specimen demonstrated mutations in both KRAS2 and TP53. RAS and FLT3 mutations, which are thought to stimulate the proliferation of leukemia cells, appear to be less common in t-MDS/t-AML than in de novo AML, whereas TP53 mutations are more frequent",

Malignant transformation and occurrence of metastases has been described. Immunohistochemical analysis shows an enhanced expression of P53 protein in ameloblastomas. Mutation of the tp53 tumor suppressor gene was verified in several human tumors. In this study histological sections were analyzed for the expression of P53 protein and the tp53 gene was examined for mutations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tumor DNA from 29 patients with an ameloblastoma was examined for mutations in exons 5 to 8 of the tp53 tumor suppressor gene using PCR, SSCP,- and sequential analysis. Histological sections of the tumors were analyzed immunohistochemically for an overexpression of P53 protein. RESULTS: Two tp53 mutations (6.9%) in ameloblastomas were verified for the first time. In all 58.6% of the tumors showed an immunoreactivity for P53 protein. There was a statistically significant positive correlation (Fisher's exact test p<0.0148) between an increased number of P53-positive tumor cells and the appearance of recurrence. DISCUSSION: In the face of the uncertain postoperative behavior of ameloblastomas, the immunohistochemical verification of more than 10% P53-positive tumor cells may give a prognostic indication for a tendency to recurrence",

    "Abstract": "Analysis of the genetic status of Ki-ras and p53 in primary colorectal carcinomas and matched colorectal liver metastasis from 30 patients reveals an overall heterogeneity both within and between the two tumoral tissues. Both genes were found mutated with a similar frequency in both tissues; however, identical mutations in primary tumor and matched metastasis were found less frequently in the case of the Ki-ras than the p53 gene. Only in three cases the same p53 and Ki-ras mutations found in the primary tumor were found also in the metastasis. In several metastatic specimens the DNA bearing a mutation detected also in the primary tumor appears significantly less abundant than the wild-type DNA. These data are discussed in the light of current models of primary tumor/metastasis relationships",

    "Abstract": "To address the cellular basis for the response to ovarian cancer treatment, we characterized the chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity of four human epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines that harbor different genetic alterations. The TOV-21G, TOV-81D, OV-90, and TOV-112D cell lines were derived from ovarian tumors (TOV) or ascites (OV) from chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-naive patients and were characterized by their mutation spectrum of BRCA2, TGFbeta-RII, KRAS2, TP53, and CDKN2A. Cells were monitored for survival following exposure at various concentrations to different cytotoxic agents including cisplatin, camptothecin or paclitaxel or to different doses of gamma-irradiation. At the lowest doses, the TGFbeta-RII-mutated and KRAS2-mutated cell line, TOV-21G, and the BRCA2-mutated cell line, TOV-81D, demonstrated a significantly higher sensitivity to cisplatin and gamma-irradiation than the TP53-mutated cell lines, TOV-112D and OV-90. At higher doses, differences between the TP53-mutated lines were observed with TOV-112D being less sensitive to cisplatin than OV-90 that also harbors a CDNK2A mutation. All cell lines were similarly sensitive to high doses of gamma-irradiation. In contrast, sensitivity to camptothecin or paclitaxel was not significantly different between all cell lines, irrespective of the mutation status of BRCA1, BRCA2, TGFbeta-RII, KRAS2, TP53, and CDKN2A. The observed responses to treatment are consistent with the current knowledge concerning BRCA2, TGFbeta-RII, KRAS2, TP53, and/or CDKN2A aberrant function",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the application of immunohistochemistry-laser microdissection-polymerase chain reaction (IHC-LMD-PCR) technique in detecting p53 gene mutations using paraffin sections of advanced gastric cancers. METHODS: The expression of p53 protein in 41 paraffin-embedded advanced gastric cancer samples was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The p53-positive or negative carcinoma cells and normal foveolar cells far from the main tumor were then isolated by LMD. The DNA was extracted and p53 gene at exon 5 - 8 amplified by PCR. The products were then analyzed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and automated sequencing. RESULTS: p53 gene was successfully amplified in all the 41 specimens. Overexpression of p53 protein was noted in 11 cases. Mutations of p53 gene were found in 15 cases. Eight of the 11 p53-overexpressed cases had p53 gene mutations. On the other hand, p53 gene mutations were found in only 7 of the 30 p53 protein-negative cases. The presence of p53 gene mutations significantly correlated with p53 protein overexpression (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: IHC-LMD-PCR technique can be successfully applied in paraffin sections of gastric cancers for the detection of p53 gene mutations. The results correlate well with overexpression of p53 protein",

    "Title": "Effects of mild temperature hyperthermia and p53 status on the size of hypoxic fractions in solid tumors, with reference to the effect in intratumor quiescent cell populations",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the effects of mild temperature hyperthermia (MTH) and p53 status of tumor cells on the size of hypoxic fractions (HFs) in solid tumors, with reference to the effect on intratumor quiescent (Q) cell populations. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Human head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma cells transfected with mutant TP53 (SAS/mp53) or with neo vector as a control (SAS/neo) were inoculated subcutaneously into left hind legs of Balb/cA nude mice. Mice bearing the tumors received 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) continuously to label all proliferating (P) cells in the tumors. The mice then received nicotinamide injection or carbogen gas (95% O(2), 5% CO(2)) inhalation combined with or without MTH. Nicotinamide prevents intermittent blood flow that could induce perfusion-limited acute hypoxia. Chronically hypoxic cells in regions beyond the limitation of oxygen diffusion in tumors are oxygenated by increasing the oxygen transport capacity of circulating blood with carbogen gas inhalation. After each treatment, the mice received a series of test doses of gamma-rays while alive or after tumor clamping to obtain HFs in the tumors. Immediately after irradiation, the tumors were excised, minced, and trypsinized. The tumor cell suspensions thus obtained were incubated with a cytokinesis blocker (cytochalasin-B) to inhibit cytoplasmic division while allowing nuclear division. Tumor cells not labeled with BrdU were detected with immunofluorescence staining of BrdU for P cells, and the micronucleus frequency in cells without BrdU labeling [ = Q cells] was determined. The micronucleus frequency in total (P + Q) tumor cells was determined from the tumors that were not pretreated with BrdU. RESULTS: SAS/mp53 tumors showed larger values for the size of not only the HF but also the diffusion-limited chronically HF than SAS/neo tumors. Q cell populations included a larger HF, particularly the chronically HF, than total cell populations in both tumors, especially in SAS/neo tumors. MTH could efficiently oxygenate the chronically HF, irrespective of p53 status. CONCLUSION: MTH is a useful combined treatment with a radioenhancement effect on intratumor Q cells, irrespective of the p53 status of tumor cells. The p53 status has the potential to affect microenvironmental conditions within solid tumors",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To analyze the relationship between p53 gene mutations, tobacco smoke, and alcohol consumption in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. DESIGN: We analyzed p53 gene mutations in exons 5 through 8 by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis in a cohort of 84 patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. SETTING: University hospital. RESULTS: p53 gene mutations were detected in 24 (28.6%) cases (95% confidence interval, 19.3%-39.5%), and the GC to TA transversion (33%) was the most common type of mutation (95% confidence interval, 15.6%-55.3%). Most mutations mapped to the p53 DNA-binding domain, which is necessary for the physiological activity of p53 as a tumor suppressor. A statistically significant association was found between p53 mutations and exposure to tobacco smoke (P=.001), which was the only variable significantly associated with p53 mutations in a multivariate model. The association with alcohol consumption was only at a borderline level of significance (P=.065). CONCLUSION: Our data document that a smoking habit is the only independent variable associated with an increased risk of p53 mutations in the laryngeal mucosa",

    "Title": "O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase in colorectal cancers: detection of mutations, loss of expression, and weak association with G:C>A:T transitions",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) repairs inappropriately methylated guanine in DNA. MGMT mutations have not previously been reported in cancers, but in colorectal tumours MGMT promoter methylation is common and has been associated with increased G:C>A:T transitions, a high frequency of K-ras mutations, and low level microsatellite instability (MSI low). However, some have suggested that MGMT changes are background or secondary events, with little importance for tumorigenesis. METHODS: We have analysed fresh frozen colorectal cancers and colorectal cancer cell lines for MGMT changes: mutations, allelic loss, and protein expression. RESULTS: Six of 113 cancers harboured somatic missense MGMT mutations, at least three of which probably caused reduced MGMT function and were accompanied by silencing or loss of the wild-type allele. Cancers with pathogenic MGMT mutations tended to harbour G:C>A:T somatic mutations at other loci. Overall, MGMT expression was reduced or lost in more than half of the cancers. We found no association between MGMT expression and the somatic mutation spectrum at APC, beta-catenin, K-ras, or p53, but decreased MGMT expression was weakly associated with the presence of a G:C>A:T change at any one of these loci. Reduced MGMT expression was not however associated with an increased frequency of K-ras mutations or with MSI low. CONCLUSION: In summary, we found that mutation of MGMT contributes to decreased protein function. Our findings provide good evidence to show that MGMT changes, including methylation, are selected rather than background events, at least in some cases. Decreased MGMT expression or function probably has a weak or moderate effect on the mutation spectrum in colorectal cancers",

    "Title": "Mutations in the ATM gene lead to impaired overall and treatment-free survival that is independent of IGVH mutation status in patients with B-CLL",
    "Abstract": "The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein is the principal activator of the p53 protein in the response to DNA double-strand breaks. Mutations in the ATM gene have been previously found in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLLs) but their clinical significance is unknown. We analyzed 155 CLL tumors and found 12% with ATM mutations and 4% with TP53 mutations; 2 tumors contained mutations in both genes. Retrospective analysis on selected samples indicated that the ATM mutations were usually present at diagnosis. Compared with patients with wild-type ATM/TP53 genes, patients with ATM mutations had statistically significantly reduced overall and treatment-free survival. Although present in both IGVH mutation subgroups, ATM mutations were associated with unmutated IGVH genes and they provided independent prognostic information on multivariate analysis. Mutations in the ATM gene resulted in impaired in vitro DNA damage responses. Tumors with ATM mutations only partially correlated with tumors with loss of an ATM allele through an 11q deletion and, interestingly, those 11q-deleted tumors with a second wild-type ATM allele had a preserved DNA damage response. The majority of patients with ATM mutations were refractory to DNA damaging chemotherapeutic drugs and as such might benefit from therapies that bypass the ATM/p53 pathway",

    "Title": "P53 gene mutation spectrum and the relationship between gene mutation and protein levels in pterygium",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the spectrum of p53 gene mutations and the relationship between gene mutation and p53 protein levels in pterygium. METHODS: Pterygial samples were harvested from 51 patients undergoing pterygium surgery. DNA samples for p53 mutation analyses were extracted from epithelial cells and subjected to DNA sequencing for examination of mutations in exons 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the p53 gene. In situ levels of p53 protein were studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the percentage of positively stained cells quantified. Ten normal conjunctiva samples were included in this study as controls. RESULTS: Mutations within the p53 gene were detected in 8 pterygial samples (15.7%) with only one mutation found in each sample. All the mutations observed were point mutations, with 6 being substitutions and 2 deletions. Three mutations were identified in exon 6, two in exon 7, and a single mutation found in each of exons 4, 5, and 8. P53 protein levels were scored as 0 (negative) in 31 pterygial specimens (60.8%), +1 in 9 samples (17.6%), +2 in 5 samples (9.8%), and +3 in 6 samples (11.8%) by IHC. The 8 samples found to have p53 gene mutations were equally distributed among the different levels of p53 protein observed using IHC, with 2 samples in each group. The two deletion mutations, which caused a frame shift to occur, were found in samples negative for p53 immunostaining (score 0), while substitution mutations were found in samples positively stained (score +1, +2, and +3). CONCLUSIONS: Mutations within p53 gene exons 4-8 were detected in pterygial epithelium and the mutations showed no correlation with p53 protein levels as seen by IHC",

    "Title": "TP53 mutations are associated with a particular pattern of genomic imbalances in breast carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "TP53 mutations play an important role in the development of several cancers and are present in 20-40% of all breast carcinomas, contributing to increased genomic instability. In order to address the relationship of mutated TP53 to genomic complexity, the present study analysed 61 breast carcinomas for TP53 mutations and compared mutation status with the pattern of genomic imbalances as assessed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Twenty per cent of the present series of breast carcinomas harboured TP53 mutations. An increasing number of abnormalities, as identified by CGH (higher genomic complexity), correlated significantly with mutant TP53. Among the chromosome arms most commonly altered (in more than 20% of the tumours), loss of 8p and gain of 8q were associated with TP53 mutations, whereas loss of 16q was associated with wild-type TP53. By performing supervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the CGH data, a cluster of chromosome imbalances was observed that showed differences between wild-type and mutant TP53 cases. Among these, loss of chromosome arm 5q revealed the strongest correlation with altered TP53. To investigate further the most commonly deleted region of 5q, gene expression patterns from two publicly available microarray data sets of breast carcinomas were evaluated statistically. The expression data sets identified potential target genes, including genes involved in ubiquitination and the known TP53 target CSPG2. The genomic complexity of breast carcinomas as assessed by CGH is associated with TP53 mutation status; breast cancers with TP53 mutations display more complex genomes than do those with wild-type TP53. The pattern of genomic imbalances associated with mutant TP53 is non-random, with loss of chromosome arm 5q being particularly closely associated with TP53 mutations",

    "Title": "Frequent alteration of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) and p53 pathways in the round cell component of myxoid/round cell liposarcoma: p53 gene alterations and reduced p14(ARF) expression both correlate with poor prognosis",
    "Abstract": "In myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MLS/RCLS), the presence of a round cell (RC) component has been reported to correlate with a worse prognosis for the patients. However, little is known about the molecular genetic differences between conventional myxoid (MX) components and RC components in this tumour. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible implications of molecular alterations of G1 to S-phase check-point genes, especially in the RC component. We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of p53, MDM2, p14 and p16 protein and assessed proliferative activities using MIB-1 in 29 RC components and 81 MX components from 90 cases. Mutation of the p53 gene, amplification of the MDM2 gene, homozygous deletion, methylation status and mutation of the p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) genes were also investigated, using concordant paraffin-embedded and frozen material. The data were analysed together with clinicopathological factors to assess their prognostic implications in MLS/RCLS. Immunohistochemically, the over-expression of p53 protein (p = 0.01366) and the reduced expression of p14 (p < 0.0001) and p16 (p < 0.0001) proteins were significantly more frequently observed in RC components than in MX components. Reduced expression of p14 protein correlated significantly with hypermethylation of the p14(ARF) gene promoter (p = 0.0176) and over-expression of p53 protein (p = 0.00837). By univariate analysis, reduced expression of p14 and p53 missense mutation were found to reduce the rate of survival significantly (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis, including clinicopathological factors, revealed that tumour site (p = 0.0251), the presence of an RC component (p = 0.0113), high MIB-1 labelling index (p = 0.0005) and p53 missense mutation (p = 0.0036) were adverse prognostic factors. In MLS/RCLS, reduction of p14 protein expression and p53 mutation were related to poor prognosis. Accordingly, the p14(ARF)/p53 pathway may contribute to the presence of an RC component and malignant progression in this tumour",

All three patients were older, had previously received therapy with alkylating agents without topoisomerase II inhibitors, had complex karyotypes including abnormalities of chromosomes 5 or 7, and presented acquired point mutations of the TP53 gene. No point mutations of the AML1 gene were observed. The results support a pivotal role of impaired TP53 function in the development of gene amplification or duplication in t-MDS and t-AML",

    "Abstract": "The role of TP53 mutation in transformation of follicular lymphoma (FL) to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (t-FL) was examined in a panel of 91 lymph node biopsies derived from 29 patients pre- and post-transformation. The entire TP53 coding sequence was screened and immunocytochemistry performed to determine expression of p53 and its key regulator MDM2. A total of 10 mutations were detected in eight patients (28%), although none were present at FL diagnosis. Mutations were not detected solely at the time of transformation; in three patients, mutated TP53 arose in at least one antecedent FL sample (6 months, 2.5 years and 4 years prior to transformation). Loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 locus occurred in 2/20 informative patients (only in t-FL samples). p53 staining was positive in 82% (9/11) of available biopsies with a missense mutation, and negative in 71% (45/63) with wtTP53. MDM2 expression was significantly higher in t-FL samples (mean 72% positive; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 68-76%) than FL (mean 58% positive; 95% CI 54-62%) (P<0.001) but did not correlate with TP53 status. TP53 mutation has only a limited role in the transformation of FL, exerting a heterogeneous influence upon phenotypic change. In contrast, dysregulation of MDM2 is frequent and may provide a more rational therapeutic target.",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations are uncommon but p53 is commonly expressed in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), as defined in the World Health Organization, is a heterogeneous category in which a subset of cases is associated with the t(2;5)(p23;q35) or variant translocations resulting in overexpression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). p53 has not been assessed in currently defined subsets of ALCL tumors. In this study, we assessed ALK+ and ALK- ALCL tumors for p53 gene alterations using PCR, single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing methods. We also immunohistochemically assessed ALCL tumors for p53 expression. Three of 36 (8%) ALCL tumors (1/14 ALK+, 2/22 ALK-) with adequate DNA showed p53 gene mutations. By contrast, p53 was overexpressed in 36 of 55 (65%) ALCL tumors (16 ALK+, 20 ALK-). p21, a target of p53, was expressed in 15 of 31 (48%) ALCL tumors including seven of 15 (47%) p53-positive tumors. p21 expression in a subset of ALCL suggests the presence of functional p53 protein. Apoptotic rate was significantly higher in p53-positive than p53-negative tumors (mean 2.78 vs 0.91%, P = 0.0003). We conclude that the p53 gene is rarely mutated in ALK+ and ALK- ALCL tumors. Nevertheless, wild-type p53 gene product is commonly overexpressed in ALCL and may be functional in a subset of these tumors",

    "Abstract": "Clonally related composite lymphomas of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) represent models to study the multistep transformation process in tumorigenesis and the development of two distinct tumors from a shared precursor. We analyzed six such lymphomas for transforming events. The HLs were combined in two cases with follicular lymphoma (FL), and in one case each with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In the HL/FL and HL/MCL combinations, BCL2/IGH and CCND1/IGH translocations, respectively, were detected in both the HL and NHL. No mutations were found in the tumor suppressor genes FAS, NFKBIA and ATM. The HL/DLBCL case harbored clonal replacement mutations of the TP53 gene on both alleles exclusively in the DLBCL. In conclusion, we present the first examples of molecularly verified IgH-associated translocations in HL, which also show that BCL2/IGH or CCND1/IGH translocations can represent early steps in the pathogenesis of composite HL/FL or HL/MCL. The restriction of the TP53 mutations to the DLBCL in the HL/DLBCL case exemplifies a late transforming event that presumably happened in the germinal center and affected the fate of a common lymphoma precursor cell towards development of a DLBCL",

    "Title": "Comprehensive characterization of HNPCC-related colorectal cancers reveals striking molecular features in families with no germline mismatch repair gene mutations",
    "Abstract": "A considerable fraction of families with HNPCC shows no germline mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutations. We previously detected 'hidden' MMR gene defects in 42% of such families, leaving the remaining 58% 'truly' mutation negative. Here, we characterized 50 colorectal carcinomas and five adenomas arising in HNPCC families; 24 truly MMR gene mutation negative and 31 MMR gene mutation positive. Among 31 tumors from MMR gene mutation positive families, 25 (81%) had active Wnt signaling as indicated by aberrant beta-catenin localization with or without CTNNB1 mutations, compared to only 7/18 tumors from MMR gene mutation negative families (39%; P=0.005). CGH studies revealed stable profiles in 9/16 (56%) of MMR gene mutation negative tumors, which was significantly associated with membranous beta-catenin (P=0.005). Tumors with membranous beta-catenin from the MMR gene mutation negative group also showed low frequency of TP53 mutations compared to those with nuclear beta-catenin. Thus, a majority of the MMR gene mutation negative cases exhibited a novel molecular pattern characterized by the paucity of changes in common pathways to colorectal carcinogenesis. This feature distinguishes the MMR gene mutation negative families from both HNPCC families linked to MMR defects and sporadic cases, suggesting the involvement of novel predisposition genes and pathways in such families",

    "Title": "TP53 gene mutation, an unfavorable prognostic factor for malignant lymphomas in autoimmune diseases",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene are associated with a poor prognosis in lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) developing in patients with a history of autoimmune disease (AID). METHODS: Fifty patients, 15 males and 35 females ranging in age from 23 to 83 (median, 61) years, were examined. Rheumatoid arthritis (21 cases) is the commonest type of AID followed by systemic lupus erythematosus (10), dermatomyositis (9), progressive systemic sclerosis (4), and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (6). The interval between the diagnosis of AID and LPD ranged from 1 to 660 months (mean 42 months). Histological, immunohistological, and in situ hybridization studies revealed that 37 tumors were B cell lymphomas and 13 were T cell lymphomas with the Epstein-Barr virus genome present in the tumor cells in 24% of cases. Stage of disease was I in 15 cases, II in 5, III in 9, and IV in 21. RESULTS: Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism followed by direct sequencing revealed TP53 mutations in 45.9% of B cell and 53.8% of T cell lymphomas. The follow-up study revealed an unfavorable prognosis in cases with mutations compared with those without: the 1-year survival rate was 43.5 and 73.0% in B cell and 16.7 and 50% in T cell lymphoma, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of a TP53 mutation is an unfavorable prognostic factor not only in B cell but also in T cell LPD in AID",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence and clinical significance of genetically diagnosed lymph node micrometastasis for patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: A total of 495 lymph nodes obtained from 21 patients with primary oral SCCs that had p53 mutations were examined for corresponding p53 mutations in lymph nodes using mutant allele-specific amplification (MASA). RESULTS: Among 476 histologically negative nodes, 44 were scored as positive for metastasis by MASA. All 19 histologically positive lymph nodes were genetically positive. Four of the 10 pN0 cases and nine of the 11 pN-positive cases had genetically positive micrometastases. Four patients who had five or more genetically positive lymph nodes located in three or more levels, three with disease staged as pN0 or pN1, died of cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a high rate of micrometastasis in cervical lymph nodes of oral SCCs and patients with multiple or lower neck spread of micrometastases have a poor prognosis; they should be treated with postoperative adjuvant therapy",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatic undifferentiated (embryonal) sarcoma (HUS) is an exceptional hepatic malignant tumor in adults. Genetic studies were never reported in adult cases. METHODS: In this study concerning three cases of HUS occurring in adult, we studied the three classical ways of carcinogenesis i.e. the TP53 (p53), Wnt (CTNNB1/beta-catenin and AXIN1) and telomerase (hTERT) pathways. We studied the expression of p53, beta-catenin and telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT by immunohistochemistry in the three cases; we determined TP53 gene mutation in two cases and the genome-wide allelotype, AXIN1, and CTNNB1/beta-catenin gene mutation in one case. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed an overexpression of p53 in more than 80% of tumoral cells; furthermore, mutations of TP53 were observed in two cases, involving the sequence-specific DNA binding domain. In contrast, no mutation was found in CTNNB1/beta-catenin and AXIN1 genes. Tumoral cells did not show hTERT staining nor nuclear expression of beta-catenin. In addition, allelotype analysis in one case showed loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 7p, 11p, 17p, 22q, and allelic imbalance of 1p, 8p, 20q. CONCLUSIONS: In this report of HUS in three adult patients, we emphasize the role of TP53 pathway in carcinogenesis of this rare tumor. This point could be of interest for therapeutic strategies",

    "Title": "p53 potentiation of tumor cell susceptibility to CTL involves Fas and mitochondrial pathways",
    "Abstract": "In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms used by wild-type p53 (wtp53) to potentiate tumor cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated cell death. We report that wtp53 restoration in a human lung carcinoma cell line Institut Gustave Roussy (IGR)-Heu, displaying a mutated p53, resulted in up-regulation of Fas/CD95 receptor expression associated with an increase of tumor cell sensitivity to the autologous CTL clone, Heu127. However, when IGR-Heu cells were transfected with Fas cDNA, no potentiation to Heu127-mediated lysis was observed, indicating that induction of CD95 is not sufficient to sensitize target cells to CTL killing. Importantly, our data indicate that the effect of wtp53 on the Fas-mediated pathway involves a degradation of short cellular FLICE inhibitory protein resulting in subsequent caspase 8 activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that wtp53 restoration also resulted in CTL-induced Bid translocation into mitochondria and a subsequent mitochondrial membrane permeabilization leading to cytochrome c release. These results indicate that tumor cell killing by autologous CTL can be enhanced by targeting degranulation-independent mechanisms via restoration of wtp53, a key determinant of apoptotic machinery regulation",

    "Abstract": "Abnormalities of the P53 network have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). The purpose of this study was to define P53 gene mutations, to detect MDM2 gene amplification and to estimate mRNA expression of P53, MDM2, BCL2 and BAX genes in patients with ALL and AML. Twenty-five patients with ALL and 65 patients with AML, both recently diagnosed, were included into this study. Exons 5-8 of the P53 gene with flanking intronic sequence were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and subjected to mutation screening by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP). Mutation of the P53 gene was found in one patient of the 25 with ALL and in five patients of the 65 with AML. Sequence analysis was subsequently performed. One mutation in intronic sequence in ALL and four missense mutations and one silent nucleotide substitution in AML were identified. Amplification of MDM2 gene was detected by multiplex-PCR analysis in only one sample from patient with ALL, but was not observed in any case of AML. To gain further insight into the role of P53 network in the evolution of acute leukemias, the P53, MDM2, BCL2 and BAX mRNAexpressions in portion samples from patients with ALL and AML were analyzed using multiplex RT-PCR. Although a low frequency of molecular disturbances of the P53 and the MDM2 genes was detected in this study, there was a high percentage of cases with increased mRNA level of P53 and MDM2. A high frequency of BCL2 mRNA overexpression and a relatively low frequency of BAX mRNA overexpression detected in both analyzed leukemias in this study, indicate that altered transcription of these genes may be involved in leukemogenesis",

    "Title": "Analysis of p53 status in human cell lines using a functional assay in yeast: detection of new non-sense p53 mutation in codon 124",
    "Abstract": "p53 tumor suppressor is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that controls the expression of many genes in response to diverse stress stimuli. p53 gene is often mutated in human cancer and in cancer cell lines. Several methods are available for identification of p53 mutations, including functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast (FASAY). FASAY distinguishes yeast colonies expressing functional p53 protein from colonies producing a dysfunctional p53 protein simply on the basis of color. We analyzed the p53 status of 26 human cell lines of different tissue origin using the functional assay in yeast. Wild-type p53 was found in six cell lines and various p53 aberrations in the remaining twenty. FASAY detected temperature-sensitive p53 mutations in breast cancer cell line, BT474, and leiomyosarcoma cell line, SK-LMS-1, and two independent p53 point mutations in SK-UT-1 and SK-LMS-1 leiomyosarcoma cell lines. In addition, the assay revealed that a recombination occurred between the two mutated p53 alleles producing a stable ratio of p53 wild-type alleles (11.7 or 2.7% respectively). In the case of acute myeloid leukemia cell line, ML-1, we detected both wild-type and heterozygous p53 status, depending on the source of the cell line. In Hs913T, HL60 and Saos-2 cell lines, FASAY failed to assess p53 status due to a large deletion/rearrangement of the p53 gene. In acute lymphoid leukemia HPB cell line, we disclosed unknown non-sense mutation in codon 124 of the p53 gene",

    "Title": "Mutations in the p53 and Ki-ras genes, microsatellite instability and site of tumor origin in colorectal cancer",
    "Abstract": "Using PCR-SSCP screening and direct sequencing we analyzed a series of 28 colorectal carcinomas for mutations in p53 (exons 5-8) and Ki-ras (codons 12, 13 and 61), and for micro-satellite instability (MSI) at BAT25 and BAT26, supplementing data with the analysis of the IARC colorectal cancer p53 mutation database. Mutations were correlated with the site of tumor origin (proximal or distal to the splenic flexure). We identified 19 mutations in p53, 9 in Ki-ras, and 4 MSI-positive cases in a total of 20 tumors. Only 6/20 cases (30%) carried mutations in both p53 and Ki-ras. Mutations in p53 were detected at similar frequencies in proximal and distal tumors, while IARC data pointed to a strong association of p53 mutations with distal cancers. Ki-ras mutations were more frequent in proximal tumors, and MSI occurred at similar frequencies in proximal and distal tumors and was associated with mutations in p53 or Ki-ras. The p53 mutations detected in the series analyzed, as well as those retrieved from the IARC database, were predominantly transitions, with no preferential sequence localization or nucleotide position. Ki-ras mutations were predominantly transversions in position 2 at codon 12. MSI-H occurred at similar frequencies in proximal and distal tumors and was associated with either p53 or Ki-ras mutations. Overall these data suggest that distinct mutagenic factors target p53 and Ki-ras in colorectal epithelium irrespective of MSI-H status",

    "Abstract": "The majority of global incidences of oral cancer occur in Asia, and the aetiology of oral cancer is different in Asia as it is in the West. However, whereas there is a growing understanding of the molecular mechanisms of oral cancer progression in the West, there is little progress in this understanding in Asia. In particular, the role of the p53 pathway in modulating cancer progression in Asian oral cancer remains unclear. In this study, we micro-dissected and analysed 20 well-differentiated oral squamous cell carcinoma specimens for alterations in the p53 pathway. We found that 6/20 samples contained mutations in the p53 gene which occurred in three hotspots, at codon 203, 218 and 296. Furthermore, 6/20 samples had a homozygous deletion of p14ARF, but notably p14ARF deletion and p53 mutation events were often independent and mutually exclusive. Strikingly, MDM2 was upregulated in 20/20 samples, but not in 3/3 normal tissue specimens. Taken together, these data suggest that inactivation of the p53 pathway is a frequent event in oral squamous cell carcinoma, which occurs by an aberration in one of a number of players in the p53 pathway",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of p53, K-ras, c-kit, and beta-catenin gene were examined in 100 cases of sinonasal NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) from Korea and Japan. Age of patients ranged from 12 to 72 (median 41.0) in Korea and 27 to 82 (median 61.0) years in Japan. Gene mutations were analyzed on paraffin-embedded specimens by PCR-SSCP followed by direct sequencing. p53 is a well-known tumor suppressor gene. c-kit gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, which plays a crucial role in proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Mutations of K-ras and beta-catenin are frequently observed in cancers. Thirteen of 42 (31.0%) cases from Korea and 36 of 58 (62.1%) from Japan had p53 mutations, showing significant differences in the incidence of p53 mutation between two countries. Of the Japanese cases 18 (31.0%) had mutations in exon 4, while only 3 cases (7.1%) were found in Korea cases (p<0.01 by chi2 test). K-ras, c-kit and beta-catenin mutations were also found in higher incidence in Japanese cases. In conclusion, different frequency of p53 mutations with different pattern of exon involvement and difference in age of disease onset is evident between sinonasal NKTCL in Korea and Japan",

    "Title": "p53 alterations in sequential biopsies of Asian follicular lymphoma: a study of immunohistochemical staining pattern and gene mutations by PCR-SSCP in paraffin-embedded tissues",
    "Abstract": "AIM: Tumour suppressor gene p53 is a common target in carcinogenesis, reported to be altered and functionally inactive in 70% of human cancers. Although p53 mutations are less commonly present in haematological malignancies when compared with other solid tumours, they have been reported in histological transformation of follicular lymphoma. We aimed to investigate the frequency of p53 gene alterations in paraffin-embedded tissue using commercially available PCR-SSCP, and to correlate the results with P53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. METHODS: Surgical samples from seven patients with a total of 17 sequential biopsies were retrieved for the study of p53 gene expression using immunohistochemical stain, and gene status by PCR-SSCP for exons 5-8. The tumours were graded according to the WHO classification criteria. P53 was distinctly over-expressed in five transformed higher grade biopsies, and all except one showed electrophoretic mobility shift in PCR-SSCP analysis. Sequencing analysis revealed single nucleotide substitutions in three of four of these high-grade transformed cases with band shift (75%), whereas some other studies reported a lower frequency of 25-30%, and mobility shift result was found to correlate with P53 expression. Lower grade tumours without P53 over-expression did not demonstrate band shift, and sequencing analysis did not reveal mutations. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility of adopting PCR-SSCP for screening of p53 mutations in archival tissue samples in this study, and there is a strong correlation of p53 gene over-expression and mutation events in high-grade transformed tumours",

    "Title": "TP53 mutations in ovarian carcinomas from sporadic cases and carriers of two distinct BRCA1 founder mutations; relation to age at diagnosis and survival",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian carcinomas from 30 BRCA1 germ-line carriers of two distinct high penetrant founder mutations, 20 carrying the 1675delA and 10 the 1135insA, and 100 sporadic cases were characterized for somatic mutations in the TP53 gene. We analyzed differences in relation to BRCA1 germline status, TP53 status, survival and age at diagnosis, as previous studies have not been conclusive. METHODS: DNA was extracted from paraffin embedded formalin fixed tissues for the familial cases, and from fresh frozen specimen from the sporadic cases. All cases were treated at our hospital according to protocol. Mutation analyses of exon 2-11 were performed using TTGE, followed by sequencing. RESULTS: Survival rates for BRCA1-familial cases with TP53 mutations were not significantly lower than for familial cases without TP53 mutations (p = 0.25, RR = 1.64, 95% CI [0.71-3.78]). Median age at diagnosis for sporadic (59 years) and familial (49 years) cases differed significantly (p < 0.001) with or without TP53 mutations. Age at diagnosis between the two types of familial carriers were not significantly different, with median age of 47 for 1675delA and 52.5 for 1135insA carriers (p = 0.245). For cases > or = 50 years at diagnosis, a trend toward longer survival for sporadic over familial cases was observed (p = 0.08). The opposite trend was observed for cases < 50 years at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: There do not seem to be a protective advantage for familial BRCA1 carriers without TP53 mutations over familial cases with TP53 mutations. However, there seem to be a trend towards initial advantage in survival for familial cases compared to sporadic cases diagnosed before the age of 50 both with and without TP53 mutations. However, this trend diminishes over time and for cases diagnosed > or = 50 years the sporadic cases show a trend towards an advantage in survival over familial cases. Although this data set is small, if confirmed, this may be a link in the evidence that the differences in ovarian cancer survival reported, are not due to the type of BRCA1 mutation, but may be secondary to genetic factors shared. This may have clinical implications for follow-up such as prophylactic surgery within carriers of the two most frequent Norwegian BRCA1 founder mutations",

RESULTS: The single-stranded technique showed heterozygous defects in the TP53 gene in 8 of 39 (20.5%) melanoma tumors: three new single point mutations in intronic sequences (introns 1 and 2) and exon 10, and three new single nucleotide polymorphisms located in introns 1 and 2 (C to T transition at position 11701 in intron 1; C insertion at position 11818 in intron 2; and C insertion at position 11875 in intron 2). One melanoma tumor exhibited two heterozygous alterations in the CDKN2A exon 1 one of which was novel (stop codon, and missense mutation). No defects were found in the remaining genes. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that these genes are involved in melanoma tumorigenesis, although they may be not the major targets. Other suppressor genes that may be informative of the mechanism of tumorigenesis in skin melanomas should be studied",

    "Abstract": "Patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) are prone to develop malignancies at an early age. Besides hematologic malignancies, squamous cell carcinomas in the anogenital region and head and neck are also frequently found in these patients. The aim of this study was to generate a panel of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines and xenografts of FA HNSCC, and to characterize these cell lines in comparison with a panel of seven cell lines from patients with sporadic HNSCC. Analyses have been done on sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, loss of heterozygosity profile, TP53 mutations, TP53 polymorphisms and the presence of human papillomavirus. Four FA HNSCC cell lines were established. Sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents (cisplatin) in the FA HNSCC cell lines was on average 10 times higher as compared with the sporadic HNSCC cell lines. Human papillomavirus was not detected in any of the FA or sporadic cell lines. No differences were found in loss of heterozygosity pattern, TP53 mutation frequency and TP53 polymorphism between FA and sporadic HNSCC cell lines. This is the first report on the generation of squamous cell lines of FA patients. The FA HNSCC cell lines we have generated may be utilized for future studies and might aid in the development of new preventive therapies for FA patients. The genetic characteristics of these cell lines suggest that FA HNSCC are not very different from sporadic HNSCC, except for the sensitivity to cisplatin which is consistent with the known cellular FA phenotype",

    "Title": "TP53 and KRAS mutation load and types in lung cancers in relation to tobacco smoke: distinct patterns in never, former, and current smokers",
    "Abstract": "TP53 mutations are common in lung cancers of smokers, with high prevalence of G:C-to-T:A transversions generally interpreted as mutagen fingerprints of tobacco smoke. In this study, TP53 (exons 5-9) and KRAS (codon 12) were analyzed in primary lung tumors of never (n = 40), former (n = 27), and current smokers (n = 64; mainly heavy smokers). Expression of p53, cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), and nitrotyrosine (N-Tyr), a marker of protein damage by nitric oxide, were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. TP53 mutations were detected in 47.5% never, 55.6% former, and 77.4% current smokers. The relative risk for mutation increased with tobacco consumption (P(linear trend) < 0.0001). G:C-to-T:A transversions (P = 0.06, current versus never smokers) and A:T-to-G:C transitions (P = 0.03, former versus never smokers) were consistently associated with smoking. In contrast, G:C-to-A:T transitions were associated with never smoking (P = 0.02). About half of mutations in current smokers fell within a particular domain of p53 protein, suggesting a common structural effect. KRAS mutations, detected in 20 of 131 (15.3%) cases, were rare in squamous cell carcinoma compared with adenocarcinoma [relative risk (RR), 0.2; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.07-1] and were more frequent in former smokers than in other categories. No significant differences in Cox-2 expression were found between ever and never smokers. However, high levels of N-Tyr were more common in never than ever smokers (RR, 10; 95% CI, 1.6-50). These results support the notion that lung tumorigenesis proceeds through different molecular mechanisms according to smoking status. In never smokers, accumulation of N-Tyr suggests an etiology involving severe inflammation",

Thirty-seven mutations of the p53 gene were detected in 45.5% (34/75) of tumor specimens. These mutations significantly clustered in exon 5 (21/37) of the p53 gene. The incidence of p53 mutations did not associate with clinicopathological characteristics or the habits of cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption. However, BQ chewers exhibited significantly higher incidence of p53 gene mutations than non-chewers (67.6% vs 32.4%, P = 0.007). After controlling the confounding factors of cigarette smoking and alcohol intake, BQ chewing still showed significant association with the incidence of p53 mutation in ESCCs (RR = 4.23; 95% CI, 1.317-13.60). The A:T to G:C transition (8/37, 21.6%) and G:C to T:A transversion (5/23, 13.5%) were the prevalent spectrum of p53 gene mutations. All A:T to G:C transitional mutations occurred in patients with the habits of BQ chewing and cigarette smoking. Noticeably, alcohol consumption could enhance this peculiar spectrum of p53 mutation in ESCC. Accordingly, p53 might be an important molecular target of BQ carcinogens in the development of ESCC in Taiwanese",

    "Abstract": "Epithelial neoplasms of appendix are infrequent, and their pathological features are not fully characterized. We collected 33 cases of appendiceal tumors and examined immunohistochemically the expression of cytokeratins (CK, CK7, and CK20), mucin core protein (MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC6), E-cadherin, chromogranin A, and p53 protein. Gene analysis of TP53 was also conducted on exons 5 to 8. Clinically, mucinous tumors were predominant in females. Immunohistochemically, all the tumors expressed CK20, whereas CK7 was positive in one third of the cases. Similarly, MUC2 was expressed in all the tumors, whereas MUC1 and MUC5AC were detected in about a half of the cases. Although chromogranin A-positive cells are generally sparse in normal appendix, they were more common in mucinous tumors than in nonmucinous tumors. Contrary to the previous data reported (Mod Pathol 2002;15:599-605), mucinous carcinoma exhibited a higher frequency of p53-positive cells (mean 29%) compared with mucinous adenoma (2.8%) (P < .001), whereas nonmucinous tumors showed high levels of p53-positive cells to similar extent (51%-67%) in both adenoma and carcinoma. The high expression of p53 protein coincided with the presence of mutations in multiple sites of TP53 gene in mucinous tumors. This is the first report that characterized the immunophenotypic profile of appendiceal epithelial neoplasms with an emphasis of a higher frequency of p53 positivity in mucinous carcinoma cases compared with mucinous adenoma in the appendix",

    "Title": "Altered trafficking of Fas and subsequent resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis occurs by a wild-type p53 independent mechanism in esophageal adenocarcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Decreased cell-surface expression of Fas (CD95) results in resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). Because p53 is known to increase transcription of Fas and also may induce trafficking of the protein to the plasma membrane, we investigated whether the loss of wild-type (wt)-p53 function accounts for our previous findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgical specimens of Barrett's Esophagus containing areas of dysplasia were immunostained for p53 and Fas protein expression. Three EA cell lines were transfected with a wt-p53 containing adenovirus to examine the effects of p53 overexpression. The p53 status of these EA cell lines was determined by sequence analysis. RESULTS: Regions of dysplasia where p53 protein accumulation was observed corresponded to areas of loss of Fas expression. Sequence analysis of the p53 coding sequence in three EA cell lines (Seg-1, Bic-1, and Flo-1) that retain Fas protein within the cytoplasm, demonstrated that Seg-1 contained wt-p53, but mutations were found in Flo-1 and Bic-1 cell lines. Adenoviral transduction of the cell lines with wt-p53 resulted in cell growth arrest in Seg-1 and Bic-1 and induced cell death in Flo-1, but did not result in an increase in Fas protein expression, cell-surface expression, or restoration of sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that decreased cell-surface expression of Fas and resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis may occur independently of loss of wt p53 expression",

    "Abstract": "The ATM/p53 pathway plays a critical role in maintenance of genome integrity and can be targeted for inactivation by a number of characterized mechanisms including somatic genetic/epigenetic alterations and expression of oncogenic viral proteins. Here, we examine a panel of 24 SCCHN tumors using various molecular approaches for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV), mutations in the p53 gene and methylation of the ATM promoter. We observed that 30% of our SCCHN samples displayed the presence of HPV and all but one was HPV type 16. All HPV E6 gene-positive tumors exhibited E6 transcript expression. We observed 21% of the tumors harbored p53 mutations and 42% of tumors displayed ATM promoter methylation. The majority of tumors (71%) were positive for at least one of these events. These findings indicate that molecular events resulting in inactivation of the ATM/p53 pathway are common in SCCHN and can arise by a number of distinct mechanisms",

    "Abstract": "The etiological role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in esophageal carcinoma (EC) in relation to p53, mdm2, p21(waf), c-erbB2 and the overall survival (OS) rate was investigated. Tumor and normal tissues from 50 EC were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and InnoLiPA for HPV. Single strand conformation polymorphism/sequencing were used to detect p53 gene mutations. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine p53, mdm2, p21(waf)and c-erbB2 expression. Human papillomavirus was detected in 54% of tumors and in 24% of normal tissues. p53, mdm2 and c-erbB2 overexpression was detected in 68%, 70% and 60% of tumors and in 14%, 16% and 10% of normal samples, whereas loss of p21(waf) was evident in 64% of tumors. p53 mutations were detected in 20% of cases. Exon 8 and 5 showed the highest mutation rate (40% each), followed by exons 6 and 7 (10% each). There was a significant correlation between HPV and p53, mdm2, c-erbB2 overexpression. The OS was significantly associated with overexpression of p53 and loss of p21(waf). Human papillomavirus infection is frequent in Egyptian EC. Both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways seem to be involved in HPV-associated EC. mdm2 and c-erbB2 are possible targets for HPV in the p53-independent pathway. However, only advanced stage and aberrant expression of p53 and p21(waf) are independent prognostic markers",

    "Title": "Molecular pathological subclassification of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the colorectum",
    "Abstract": "The purpose of the present report was to examine the possibility of molecular pathological subtyping of mucinous adenocarcinomas (MAC) of the colorectum. Thirty-five formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded MAC specimens of the colorectum were analyzed. Genetic alterations of p53 gene and microsatellite instability (MSI) as well as immunohistochemical analysis of mucin subtypes (human gastric mucin (HGM), anti-mucin monoclonal antibody recognizing gastric gland mucous cells-1, MUC2, CD10) and expression levels of human mutL homolog 1 (hMLH1), p53 and Ki-67 were performed. According to MSI and p53 status, these tumors were subclassified into three groups: mutator-type tumors with a high frequency of MSI (20%), suppressor/p53-type tumors with p53 mutation, p53 overexpression or loss of heterozygosity of D17S250 (an adjacent locus to p53; 40%) and the unclassified tumors (40%). The suppressor/p53-type tumors had a significant association with distal colon location (P = 0.019), venous invasion (P = 0.002), extent of lymph node metastasis (P = 0.007) and higher tumor stage (P = 0.018). In contrast, mutator-type tumors had frequent expression of HGM (P = 0.005) and prominent lymphocytic infiltration at the advancing front of the tumor (P = 0.005). These results indicate that MAC of the colorectum could be subclassified according to molecular pathological background, reflecting distinct clinicopathological and phenotypic characteristics",

    "Title": "p53 status and response to radiotherapy in rectal cancer: a prospective multilevel analysis",
    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a prospective study, the predictive role of p53 status analysed at four different levels in identifying the response to preoperative radiotherapy in rectal adenocarcinoma. Before treatment, 70 patients were staged and endoscopic forceps biopsies from the tumour area were taken. p53 status was assessed by total cDNA sequencing, allelic loss analysis, immunohistochemistry, and p53 antibodies. Neoadjuvant treatment was based on preoperative radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. Response to therapy was evaluated after surgery by both pathologic downstaging and histologic tumour regression grade. In all, 35 patients (50.0%) had p53 gene mutations; 44.4% of patients had an allelic loss; nuclear p53 overexpression was observed in 39 patients (55.7%); and p53 antibodies were detected in 11 patients (16.7%). In the multilevel analysis of p53 status, gene mutations correlated with both nuclear protein overexpression (P < 0.0001) and loss of heterozygosity (P = 0.013). In all, 29 patients (41.4%) were downstaged by pathologic analysis, and 19 patients (29.2%) were classified as tumour regression grade 1. Whatever the method of evaluation of treatment response, no correlation between p53 alterations and response to radiotherapy was observed. Our results do not support the use of p53 alterations alone as a predictive marker for response to radiotherapy in rectal carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Anaplastic astrocytoma (AA, WHO grade III) is, second to Glioblastoma, the most common and most malignant type of adult CNS tumour. Since survival for patients with AA varies markedly and there are no known useful prognostic or therapy response indicators, the primary purpose of this study was to examine whether knowledge of the known genetic abnormalities found in AA had any clinical value. The survival data on 37 carefully sampled AA was correlated with the results of a detailed analysis of the status of nine genes known to be involved in the development of astrocytic tumours. These included three genes coding for proteins in the p53 pathway (TP53, p14(ARF)and MDM2), four in the Rb1 pathway (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, RB1 and CDK4) and PTEN and EGFR. We found that loss of both wild-type copies of any of the three tumour suppressor genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B and RB1 or gene amplification of CDK4, disrupting the Rb1 pathway, were associated with shorter survival (P=0.009). This association was consistent in multivariate analysis, including adjustment for age (P=0.013). The findings suggest that analysis of the genes coding for Rb1 pathway components provides additional prognostic information in AA patients receiving conventional therapy",

We observed the LOH of PTEN in 11.1% of the patients with normal p53s and 46.2% of the patients with p53 gene mutations. The result that LOH of PTEN was frequently observed in the cases with p53 gene mutations and other data in this study suggested that both PTEN and p53 have complimentary roles in gastric carcinoma development",

The majority of studies, on analyzing TP53 mutations, have not included all splice junctions. Consequently, splice site mutations are thought to be relatively infrequent. TP53 were examined for mutations by polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing in cases of diffuse astrocytomas. We found TP53 mutations in 17.8% (8 out of 45) of the tumors tested: 3 splicing, 3 missense and 2 silent mutations. We have shown that splice site mutations of TP53 are more frequent than previously reported. These findings emphasize the importance of thorough screening of TP53 mutations in gliomas",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutation and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in esophageal carcinoma from three different endemic geographic regions of India",
    "Abstract": "Infection of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), particularly the HPV types 16 and 18 and mutation or aberrant expression of the p53 tumour suppressor gene, has strongly been implicated in human esophageal carcinoma, which shows a great variation in geographic distribution. Neither the reason(s) for such a variation nor the etiopathogenesis of the disease is clearly understood. The present study has been carried out to determine prevalence of high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 and the p53 gene mutation in patients from three distinctly different endemic geographic regions of India, viz. Kashmir, Dibrugarh, and New Delhi where esophageal cancer is most prevalent. The people from each of these regions differ considerably in their food, drinking, smoking and chewing habits (tobacco and betel nut) and ethnic background. While PCR was employed to detect high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 DNA sequences, PCR-SSCP and direct nucleotide sequencing was used for analysis of p53 mutation. Out of a total of 101 biopsy specimens of carcinoma esophagus analysed, the frequency of HPV was found to be the highest 14/32 (44%) in Dibrugarh followed by 33% (11/33) in Kashmir, but, interestingly, no high-risk HPV could be detected in New Delhi patients who showed the highest frequency (30.6%) of p53 mutation as against only 12.5% in Dibrugarh and 6.1% in Kashmir. The difference in the frequency of p53 mutation between the three regions was statistically highly significant (0.018). Out of a total of 21 nucleotide alterations observed, 12 missense, five frameshift and four were silent changes. The p53 exon 7 appears to be the 'hot-spot' for esophageal cancer as it alone was responsible for more than 76% (13/17) of mutations and more than 95% (20/21) of the patients with p53 mutation were smokers. The results demonstrate differential distribution of HPV infection and p53 mutation in esophageal cancer from different geographic regions of India and this could be due to variation in diet, drinking, and tobacco habit, including ethnic, socio-cultural and genetic variation",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we analyzed the role of the p53 status for paclitaxel/Taxol sensitivity in renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) of the clear cell type. Using immunohistochemistry, nuclear p53 accumulation could not be correlated to the paclitaxel/Taxol sensitivity. DNA sequencing detected a p53 gene mutation in two out of eight RCC cell lines, i.e. in exon 8 (cell line clearCa-6), and in exon 9 (cell line clearCa-5). No correlation, however, was found between the p53 status of our RCC cell lines and their paclitaxel/Taxol sensitivity as indicated by the IC50 values. However, paclitaxel-induced growth inhibition in paclitaxel-sensitive RCC cell lines was accompanied by an increase in apoptosis, irrespective of their p53 status. Although CD95 up-regulation was observed in renal cell carcinoma with wild-type p53 upon paclitaxel treatment, paclitaxel-induced apoptosis itself is triggered independently from the CD95 system. In conclusion, the p53 status cannot predict paclitaxel/Taxol sensitivity in RCC cell lines of the clear cell type",

We examined 42 women with breast cancer and 51 controls. A total of 42 women with breast cancer as well as healthy controls were investigated and results showed that p53 codon 72 polymorphism is statistically significantly associated with breast cancer (OR for Arg/Arg to non-Arg/Arg was 6.66, P = 0.0001 at 95% CI 2.63-16.9), but not Her 2 and MTHFR polymorphisms are associated with breast cancer (OR for Ile/Ile to non-Ile/Ile was 1.33, P = 0.54 at 95% CI 0.52-3.38 and OR for T/T versus non-T/T was 1.07, P = 0.89 at 95% CI 0.35-3.25). All subjects were examined for p53 exons 5-8 mutations. Three novel sequence variations in exons 7 and 8 of TP53 gene were found in three patients.

    "Title": "High frequency of frameshift mutation on p53 gene in Taiwanese with non small cell lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "Extensive researches have found that the mutation of p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequent event in many human cancers and associated with a poor clinical outcome in lung cancer patients. Because the p53 molecular mutation involved in tumorigenesis of patients with lung cancer in Taiwan remains poorly defined, the aim of this study was to assess the p53 mutation spectrum and possible etiological factors of Taiwan's patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Cancer specimens were obtained surgically from 61 patients with pathologically proven NSCLC. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing were used to study p53 mutations in exon 4-8. We also performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect p53 protein expression. Our results provided that 34 mutations of p53 gene were found in 27 cases with a mutation rate of 44% (27/61). There were six cases having more than two p53 mutations. Among the 34 mutations, 19 were point mutations (56%, 19/34) consisted of a majority of missense mutations including transversion (13/19, 68%) and transitions (6/19, 32%) with four cases (4/6, 67%) occurring in the CpG sequence. One of the most important finding in our study was the high frequency of frameshift (44%, 15/34) which included 11 insertions and 4 deletions of p53 in NSCLC in Taiwan. Surprisingly, our results disclosed distinct novel mutations at codon 181, 185, 208 (Exon 5-6) of p53. Especially, 4 cases with mutation at codon181 and codon 185 seemed to have more advanced clinical outcome with survival time less than 6 months. In addition, there were two recurring mutations at codon 168 and three at condon193. The different mutation spectrum in our series, including a high frequency of frameshift mutations and distinctly novel hot spots suggested the heterogenous entity of exogenous mutagens in NSCLC in Taiwan",

    "Abstract": "Since genetic abnormalities of human cancer are greatly geographically dependent, cultural and environmental backgrounds are thought to be closely related to the carcinogenic process. In the present study, eight human cell lines were established by culture from untreated carcinomas of the oral cancer, of which five were from primary oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSC), one from a mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) and one each originating from metastatic OSC and MEC. All the studied tumor lines grew as monolayers, and showed: i) an epithelial origin by the presence of cytokeratin, and ii) tumorigenic potential in nude mice. Western blot analysis revealed i) over expression of EGFR in six of the cell lines ii) decreased expression of E-cadherin in six cell lines compared to normal human oral mucosa. A mutational analysis showed: point mutations of p53 at exon 7, with transversion, and at exon 8, with transition. These well-characterized human YD cell lines should serve as useful tools in the study of the molecular pathogenesis and biological characteristics of head and neck cancer cells, and in the future testing of new therapeutic reagents for oral cancer",

    "Title": "Radiation-induced cerebellar glioblastoma at the site of a treated medulloblastoma: case report",
    "Abstract": "Radiation-induced glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a rare complication of radiotherapy. The authors report such a case occurring 10 years after treatment of cerebellar medulloblastoma. The patient was a 15-year-old boy who had undergone a gross-total removal of a medulloblastoma and received radiation therapy at the age of 5 years. He had experienced no tumor recurrences for 10 years until a new enhancing mass was found at the original site of the medulloblastoma. Following its resection the new lesion was found to be a GBM and there was no evidence of a medulloblastoma. The second tumor developed at the same site as the previous one after a sufficient latent period and fulfilled the criteria for a radiation-induced neoplasm. The original tumor cells expressed synaptophysin without p53 overexpression, a characteristic feature of medulloblastomas. In contrast, cells from the later tumor expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein and p53 but not synaptophysin. A sequence analysis of the p53 gene showed deletion at codon 233 and a C to G transition at codon 278 in the GBM but no mutation in the medulloblastoma. A GBM specimen revealed no amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor compared with a normal control specimen. In conclusion, the clinical features of a radiation-induced GBM are similar to that of the primary GBM, whereas its genetic alterations render it a secondary GBM. These findings indicate that radiation-induced GBM should be considered a distinct clinical entity",

    "Abstract": "The aetiology of brain tumours remains unclear. Occupational exposures to pesticides and organic solvents are suspected risk factors. The case-control study CEREPHY (221 cases, 442 controls) carried in the Departement de la Gironde in France revealed a significantly increased risk of brain tumours for subjects most exposed to pesticides. In some cancers, TP53 mutations could reflect exposure to specific carcinogens. These mutations are present in approximately 30% of astrocytic brain tumours. In a pilot study, we explored the hypothesis that pesticide or solvent exposure could raise the frequency of TP53 mutations in brain tumour cells. We investigated TP53 mutations in exons 2-11 by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and sequencing, and p53 accumulation by immunohistochemistry in brain tumour of the 30 patients from CEREPHY study with a history of occupational exposure to pesticides (n = 21) and/or organic solvents (n = 14) for whom tumoral tissue was available. Included cases concerned 27% of CEREPHY cases exposed to pesticides and, based on the cumulative index of occupational exposure, they were more exposed to pesticides. There were 12 gliomas, 6 meningiomas, 7 neurinomas, 2 central nervous system lymphomas and 3 tumours of other histological types. We detected TP53 mutations in three tumours, which is similar to the expected number (3.3) calculated from 46 published studies referenced in the IARC TP53 mutations database, taking into account histological types. Considering TP53 mutations previously detected in the laboratory by DHPLC and the frequency of TP53 polymorphisms detected in this sample (similar to published data), the TP53 mutations rate is probably not underestimated. These preliminary results, even if it was on a limited number of tumours, are not in favour of the role of pesticide or organic solvent exposure in the occurrence of TP53 mutations in brain tumours",

    "Title": "p53 point mutation is rare in meningiomas from Singaporean patients",
    "Abstract": "In Asian populations, meningiomas account for up to 35% of all central nervous system tumours, a significantly higher incidence than in Caucasian populations. While several studies have examined p53 both at the level of the gene and the protein in both benign and malignant meningiomas, its role remains controversial, particularly with regard to the discrepancy between p53 over-expression and gene mutation. We examined 19 benign meningiomas, all of which were known to over-express p53, and eight malignant meningiomas, of which three were known to over-express p53, for mutations in the p53 gene using polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing of exons 4 to 9, inclusive. Only one single mutation was detected in a benign meningioma, confirming that p53 over-expression in meningiomas is commonly found in the absence of gene mutations, and that despite the significantly higher incidence of meningiomas in some Asian populations, this is not associated with a significantly higher rate of p53 mutations",

    "Title": "DHPLC is superior to SSCP in screening p53 mutations in esophageal cancer tissues",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene universally occur on exons 5-8 in human cancer. We analyzed these mutations in esophageal cancer tissue from 207 patients in China using 2 methods, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), one of the most frequently used methods, and the recently developed denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), and compared their sensitivity and efficiency. Exons 5-8 of p53 were amplified from esophageal cancer tissue genomes, screened for fragments of mutations and polymorphisms by SSCP and DHPLC in a blind study and confirmed by direct sequencing to detect the mutations and polymorphisms. The numbers detected by DHPLC were greater than those detected by SSCP, though the rate of mutations and polymorphisms was lower in SSCP than in DHPLC, which appeared to detect smaller mutations (substitutions and 1 bp insertions/deletions). Of the mutations with substitutions detected by DHPLC but not by SSCP, 50% substituted adenosine for other nucleotides, suggesting that these mutations are often missed when SSCP is used. According to these data, the sensitivity of SSCP and DHPLC was 81% and 97%, respectively, and the specificity was 97% and 85%, respectively. Our results suggest that DHPLC may be recommended over SSCP when screening gene mutations. Thus, rates of p53 mutations and polymorphisms in esophageal cancer tissue in Chinese patients were 49% and 41% by DHPLC and SSCP, respectively",

    "Title": "Influence of GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1 and NAT2 genotypes on the p53 mutational spectrum in bladder tumours",
    "Abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms affecting expression or activity of the corresponding enzymes can influence the risk of acquiring gene mutations and various cancers. We have studied 327 bladder cancer patients with regard to the functionally related polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1 and NAT2 and analysed the p53 mutational status of their tumours. Fifty p53 mutations, 26% transversions and 74% transitions, were detected in 44 patients. P53 mutation frequency was significantly higher in higher-grade tumours than in low-grade tumours (OR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.44-3.02, adjusted for age and sex). Also, a significant association was found between tumour stage (Tis and T2+ vs. Ta and T1) and presence of the GSTP1 val allele (adjusted OR = 2.00, CI 1.14-3.52). Overall, there was no significant difference in frequency of p53 mutation among patients with different genotypes. Among patients with p53 mutation, transversions were significantly more frequent in GSTM1-negative as compared to GSTM1-positive individuals (OR = 5.18, CI 1.07-25.02, adjusted for age, sex and tumour stage). With one exception, all tumours with the most common type of transversion, G:C-C:G, occurred in GSTM1-negative patients. Among smokers, all transversions (3 of 3), but only 2 of 13 transitions, were found among carriers of the GSTP1 variant allele, and samples carrying at least 1 variant GSTP1 allele had more transitions at CpG sites than wild-type samples (adjusted OR = 4.61, CI 0.82-26.04). No significant associations were found for the NAT2 gene. Our results suggest that impaired glutathione conjugation may affect the mutation spectrum in critical target genes",

    "Title": "p53 mutation profiling of multiple esophageal carcinoma using laser capture microdissection to demonstrate field carcinogenesis",
    "Abstract": "Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is one of the most frequent genetic alterations observed in human esophageal carcinomas. In patients with esophageal carcinoma, one of the significant pathological features of the tumor is the presence of multiple lesions within the esophagus. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the occurrence of multiple lesions have remained elusive. To characterize p53 alterations in multiple esophageal carcinomas and to study their roles in carcinogenesis, we performed p53 immunohistochemical and p53 mutation analyses using laser capture microdissection on surgically resected human esophageal carcinomas from 11 patients: 9 patients with multiple esophageal carcinomas, 1 with an intramural metastasis lesion within the esophagus and 1 with an intraepithelial carcinoma lesion contiguous to the main lesion. In each of the patients with multiple esophageal carcinomas, we examined samples from 1 main lesion and 1 representative concomitant lesion. Molecular analyses of samples from fresh-frozen normal tissues and tumor tissues of the main lesion (whole tumor) were also performed by the same method. p53 protein accumulation was observed in 16 (72.7%) of 22 lesions from the 11 cases. No p53 mutation was found in normal esophageal tissues. In the 9 cases of multiple esophageal carcinomas, point mutations were detected in the whole tumor in 1 (11.1%) case, in the microdissected tumor samples of main lesions in 3 (33.3%) cases and in the microdissected tumor samples of concomitant lesions in 3 (33.3%) cases. For the microdissected tumor samples, there was a 54.5% (12/22) concordance rate between the results of immunostaining and molecular analysis. In the 8 cases of whole tumors in which a p53 mutation was not observed, 2 cases revealed p53 mutation in the microdissected tumor samples of the main lesion. All 6 cases of multiple esophageal carcinomas that showed a p53 mutation in the microdissected tumor sample had a discordant p53 mutational status between the main and concomitant lesions. In contrast, both the intramural metastasis lesion and the intraepithelial carcinoma contiguous to the main lesion showed p53 mutational patterns identical to those of the main lesions. In conclusion, the analysis of microdissected DNA by laser capture microdissection is useful for characterizing the heterogeneity of the p53 gene mutation in multiple carcinoma lesions that cannot be accurately analyzed in whole esophageal tumor DNA. The finding of different p53 gene mutations among multiple esophageal carcinoma lesions suggest further evidence of multicentric or field carcinogenesis of the human esophagus",

    "Title": "Functional analysis of p53 gene and the prognostic impact of dominant-negative p53 mutation in endometrial cancer",
    "Abstract": "In addition to the loss of function, mutant p53 can possess a dominant-negative effect on wild-type p53 and may also exert gain-of-function activity. It is not clear whether the functional status of p53 mutation contributes to differences in outcome in endometrial cancer. We collected a total of 92 RNA samples of high quality from endometrial cancer tissues, and the samples were subjected to yeast functional assay and sequencing for p53 mutations. The detected mutant p53 genes were further investigated for their dominant-negative activity using a yeast-based transdominance assay. p53 mutation was found in 24 out of 92 (26.1%) tumors, of which 10 exhibited no dominant-negative activity (recessive mutation) and 14 showed dominant-negative activity. Dominant-negative p53 mutation was related to advanced stages (p = 0.01), nonendometrioid type tumors (p = 0.01) and grade 3 tumors (p = 0.04). The patients with dominant-negative mutation had significantly shorter survival than patients with no mutation (p < 0.0001) and those with a recessive mutation (p = 0.01) in the p53 gene. No difference in survival was found between the patients with tumors harboring a recessive p53 mutation and those with tumors harboring a wild-type p53. Multivariate analysis revealed that dominant-negative p53 mutation (p = 0.019), FIGO stage (p = 0.0037) and histologic subtype (p = 0.014) were independently related to patient survival. Dominant-negative p53 mutation was the most important prognostic factor for stage III/IV endometrial cancer (p = 0.0023). In conclusion, dominant-negative p53 mutation is often found in advanced stages and aggressive histologic subtypes of endometrial cancer and it is a strong predictor of survival of patients with advanced endometrial cancer. To elucidate further the role of p53 mutation in endometrial cancer, it is necessary to investigate gain-of-function activity involving dominant-negative p53 mutant proteins",

    "Title": "TP53 alterations and patterns of carcinogen exposure in a U.S. population-based study of bladder cancer",
    "Abstract": "The molecular pathology of bladder cancer has been the subject of considerable interest, and current efforts are targeted toward elucidating the interrelationships between individual somatic gene loss and both etiologic and prognostic factors. Mutation of the TP53 gene has been associated with more invasive bladder cancer, and evidence suggests that TP53 mutation, independent of stage, may be predictive of outcome in this disease. However, there is no consensus in the literature that bladder carcinogen exposure is associated with inactivation of the TP53 gene. Work to date has been primarily hospital based and, as such, subject to possible bias associated with selection of more advanced cases for study. We examined exposure relationships with both TP53 gene mutation and TP53 protein alterations in a population-based study of 330 bladder cancer cases in New Hampshire. Tobacco smoking was not associated with TP53 alterations. We found a higher prevalence of TP53 inactivation (i.e., mutation and nuclear accumulation) among hair dye users (odd ratio [OR] = 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-14.7), and the majority of these mutations were transversions. Men who had 'at risk' occupations were more likely to have mutated TP53 tumors (OR = 2.9; 95% CI 1.1-7.6). There also was a relative absence of TP53 mutation (OR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.0-2.9) and TP53 protein alterations (OR = 0.6; 95% CI 0.3-1.4) in bladder cancers from individuals with higher arsenic exposure. Our data suggest that there is exposure-specific heterogeneity in inactivation of the TP53 pathway in bladder cancers and that integration of the spectrum of pathway alterations in population-based approaches (capturing the full range of exposures to bladder carcinogens) may provide important insights into bladder tumorigenesis",

    "Title": "p53 mutation profile of squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus in Kashmir (India): a high-incidence area",
    "Abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has been reported to show geographical variation in its incidence, even within areas of ethnic homogeneity. Kashmir valley, in north of India, has been described as a high-risk area for ESCC. Here, we make a preliminary attempt to study mutations in exons 5-8 (the DNA binding domain) of the tumor suppressor gene, p53, in 55 ESCC patients from Kashmir. Polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing analysis revealed the presence of mutations in 36.36% (20/55) tumors, assessed for the extent of allelic instability. The 20 mutations, found in 20 patients, comprised of 17 single-base substitutions (11 transitions + 6 transversions) and 3 deletions. The 17 single-base variations represented 12 missense mutations, 2 nonsense mutations and 3 variations located in intron 6, 1 of which resulted in a splicing variant. The patients when compared for the incidence of p53 mutation with various demographic features revealed females to be at increased risk (p = 0.016; OR = 4.13; 95% CI = 1.26-13.46). Comparison of mutation profile with other high-risk areas reflected both differences and similarities indicating coexposure to a unique set of risk factors. This might be due to the special dietary and cultural practices of Kashmir that needs validation, as does the gender-based difference in the incidence of p53 mutation observed in this study",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: EWS-FLI1 fusion type, p53 mutation, and homozygous deletion of p16/p14ARF have each been shown to be prognostically significant in Ewing sarcoma (ES). We provide the first combined prognostic analysis of these three molecular parameters in ES. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 60 patients with ES (stage: localized in 54, metastatic in six). All cases were confirmed to contain the EWS-FLI1 (29 type 1, 12 type 2, 14 other types) or EWS-ERG fusions (five cases). Homozygous deletion of p16/p14ARF, and p53 mutations were determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization and Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) p53 GeneChip microarray hybridization, respectively. RESULTS: Eight cases (13.3%) contained point mutations of p53, and eight cases (13.3%) showed p16/p14ARF deletion, including one case with both alterations. Among 32 cases with data on histologic chemoresponse, all 10 with alterations in p53 or p16/p14ARF showed a poor chemoresponse (P = .03). Variables predicting poorer overall survival included p53 mutation alone (P < .001), either p53 or p16/p14ARF alteration (P < .001), and stage (P < .01). In multivariate analysis, alterations of p53 and/or p16/p14ARF as a single variable, was the most adverse prognostic factor (P < .001), followed by stage (P = .04). In a multivariate analysis with alterations of p53 and p16/p14ARF as separate variables, both were significant (P < .001 and P = .03, respectively). Six cases with p16/p14ARF deletion were also studied for co-deletion of the contiguous methylthioadenosine phosphorylase gene, and this was detected in four cases. CONCLUSION: Alterations in p53 or p16/p14ARF are found in a fourth of ES cases and define a subset with highly aggressive behavior and poor chemoresponse",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin is the most common human cancer. The genetic alterations underlying BCC development are only partly understood. OBJECTIVES: To investigate further the molecular genetics of sporadic BCCs, we performed mutation analyses of 10 skin cancer-associated genes in 42 tumours. METHODS: Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis followed by DNA sequencing was used to screen for mutations in the sonic hedgehog pathway genes PTCH, SMOH, SUFUH and GLI1, in the TP53 tumour suppressor gene, and in the proto-oncogenes NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF and CTNNB1. Microsatellite markers flanking the PTCH, SUFUH and TP53 loci at 9q22, 10q24 and 17p13, respectively, were studied for loss of heterozygosity (LOH). RESULTS: PTCH mutations were found in 28 of 42 tumours (67%). Microsatellite analysis revealed LOH on 9q22 in 20 of 38 tumours investigated (53%), including 14 tumours with and six tumours without PTCH mutations. SMOH mutations were identified in four of the 42 BCCs (10%) while two tumours demonstrated mutations in SUFUH, including one missense mutation and one silent mutation. None of the BCCs showed LOH at markers flanking the SUFUH locus. Seventeen BCCs (40%) carried TP53 mutations, with only three tumours showing evidence of biallelic TP53 inactivation. TP53 mutations were present in BCCs with and without mutations in PTCH, SMOH or SUFUH. Interestingly, 72% of the TP53 alterations were presumably ultraviolet (UV)-induced transition mutations. In contrast, only 40% of the PTCH and SMOH alterations corresponded to UV signature mutations. No mutations were identified in GLI1, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF or CTNNB1. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the importance of PTCH, SMOH and TP53 mutations in the pathogenesis of sporadic BCCs. SUFUH alterations are restricted to individual cases while the other investigated genes do not appear to be important targets for mutations in BCCs",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The non-steroidal, selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen is currently the most extensively used hormonal agent for the prevention and treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have shown an increased risk of endometrial cancer with tamoxifen exposure; however, few studies have examined these tumors on a molecular level. We sought to elucidate the molecular genetic alterations found in tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer. METHODS: Twenty-nine breast cancer patients with a history of tamoxifen use who subsequently developed endometrial cancer were retrospectively identified and matched for endometrial histologic subtype and grade to 29 endometrial cancers from breast cancer patients never exposed to tamoxifen. Endometrial tumor tissue was microdissected and genomic DNA extracted for each case. Direct DNA sequencing of the most commonly mutated genes in sporadic endometrial cancer, PTEN, K-RAS, TP53, and CTNNB1, was performed in addition to microsatellite instability (MI) studies. Fisher's Exact Test was utilized for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Of 29 tamoxifen-associated cancers, 10 (34.5%) contained PTEN mutations compared to 13 (44.8%) of the non-tamoxifen-associated cancers (P = 0.59). All PTEN mutations were found in tumors with endometrioid histology, reflecting what is seen in sporadic endometrial cancers. Mutations of K-RAS, TP53, and microsatellite instability were present in similar frequencies between the two breast cancer groups, and moreover, these were similar to mutational frequencies found in sporadic endometrial cancer. CONCLUSION: Tamoxifen and non-tamoxifen-associated endometrial carcinomas arising in women with breast cancer contain similar genetic alterations to those of sporadic endometrial carcinomas",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Human leukemia cell lines are of great value in leukemia research. Thus far 36 leukemia cell lines carrying the 11q23 translocation and MLL rearrangements, including two cell lines with t(6;11)(q27;q23) and an MLL-AF6 fusion gene have been described. We have established a new monocytic cell line with t(6;11), designated SHI-1, and herein describe its biological characteristics. DESIGN AND METHODS: Mononuclear cells isolated from the bone marrow of a patient with acute monocytic leukemia (AML-M5b) at relapse were inoculated and passaged by liquid culture. The biological features of the cell line were characterized by morphological assays, flow cytometry, cytogenetic analysis, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), direct sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), clonogenic culture, quantitative fluorescent PCR, zymography, short tandem repeating sequences-PCR (STR-PCR), multiplex-FISH (M-FISH), and tumorigenic capacity in nude mice. RESULTS: The SHI-1 cell line has been maintained in continuous culture without any external cytokines for three years. The morphology and immunoprofile of the cells show typical features of monocytic lineage. Karyotypic analysis demonstrated a t(6;11)(q27;q23) translocation accompanied by a deletion of 17p, which are the same abnormalities as were seen in the leukemia cells of this patient in relapse. The MLL-AF6 fusion transcript and the loss of one p53 allele were proven by chromosome painting, FISH and RT-PCR analysis in both SHI-1 cells and the primary leukemia cells. A point mutation of ATC-->ACC at codon 195 of exon 6 in another p53 allele was found by direct sequencing of DNA in SHI-1 cells as well as in the primary leukemia cells. Neither Epstein-Barr virus nor mycoplasma was detected in SHI-1 cells. Tumor masses were found in all sixteen mice 9-19 days after subcutaneous injection of SHI-1 cells. DNA fingerprinting confirmed the authenticity of the cell line. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: SHI-1 is a new monocytic leukemia cell line with the t(6;11) translocation, p53 gene alterations, and high tumorigenicity in nude mice. It could be a valuable tool in the study of leukemogenesis",

    "Abstract": "A 61-year-old man with no subjective symptom was admitted to our hospital for further examination of the causes of anemia (hemoglobin, 9.5 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (platelets, 9.2 x 10(4)/microL), which had been pointed out in a medical checkup half a year previously. A bone marrow examination showed 73% lymphoid cells. Immunophenotyping of these cells were CD19+CD20+CD3-CD5-CD10-CD23-, and light chain restriction (kappa) was positive by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. A computed tomography scan showed mild splenomegaly. To confirm the diagnosis histologically, we performed a splenectomy. Finally, we diagnosed the patient's disease as nonvillous splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL). A month after the splenectomy, the white blood cell count was remarkably increased to 7 x 10(4)/microL with the blastic transformation of lymphoid cells. We first treated the patient with fludarabine and then with the CHOP regimen (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, vincristine [Oncovin], and prednisone), but the disease was so refractory that the patient died of the disease 13 months after the splenectomy. Immunohistochemical staining and a molecular examination for p53 were carried out with specimens from the splenectomy. We found overexpression of the p53 protein in lymphoid cells and a point missense mutation in codon 280 at exon 8 that changed AGA (Arg) to AGT (Ser). This case may indicate the existence of a more aggressive subset of SMZL, suggesting a reconsideration of the roles of splenectomy and p53 overexpression in the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to patients with SMZL",

    "Title": "Mucinous cystic carcinoma of the pancreas: a unique cell line and xenograft model of a preinvasive lesion",
    "Abstract": "Pancreatic mucinous cystic tumors (MCT) are proliferations of mucin-producing epithelia supported by an ovarian-like stroma. They are classified into adenomas (MCA), borderline (MCB) and noninvasive or invasive carcinomas (MCC). The molecular mechanisms underlying their clinical behavior are poorly understood, partly due to the lack of cellular models. We report the establishment of MCC1, the first cell line from a pancreatic MCT, deriving from the highly dysplastic cell component of a noninvasive MCC. MCC1 has mutations in codon 12 of K-RAS (GGT>GAT), codon 58 of P16 (CGA>TGA) and codon 132 of P53 (AAG>AGG). The FHIT and DPC4 genes are unaltered. Immunohistochemistry shows abnormal expression of MUC1 and p53, loss of p16 and retention of Fhit and Dpc4 in both the cell line and the highly dysplastic cells of the primary lesion. The morphological and molecular features of MCC1 and its corresponding primary tumor are consistent with a model for non-invasive MCC, where K-RAS, P16, P53 and MUC1 alterations are pre-invasive changes associated with progression of malignancy of MCT from adenoma to carcinoma. MCC1 is sensitive to 5-fluorouracil, representing the first assessment of drug sensitivity for MCC. Finally, MCC1 is a suitable model for preclinical studies, as it grows in immunodeficient mice",

    "Title": "Intratumoral heterogeneous expression of p53 correlates with p53 mutation, Ki-67, and cyclin A expression in endometrioid-type endometrial adenocarcinomas",
    "Abstract": "To further elucidate the significance of p53 mutation in endometrial carcinoma, we investigated it in endometrioid-type endometrial carcinomas showing intratumoral heterogeneous p53 expression. In addition, we also examined the correlation of p53 mutation and cyclin A expression, because we previously reported a topological correlation between the expression of p53 and cyclin A. The p53 mutation in exons 5-8 in 54 cases of endometrial carcinoma showing immunohistochemical expression of p53 was examined using microdissected tissue DNAs. Of the 54 p53-positive endometrial carcinomas, 23 (43%) had p53 mutation with a tendency in histologically higher grade tumors. Ten of the 54 showed a heterogeneous p53 expression, and in 9 of the 10 cases, p53 mutation was present only in p53-positive sites, which were often found in histologically less differentiated areas with elevated Ki-67 in the same tumor. Cyclin A expression was topologically observed in p53-positive areas; however, it was noted in both tumors with (12/23, 52%) and without (18/31, 58%) p53 mutation. These results suggest that p53 mutation is a late event and plays an important role in the acquisition of malignant potentials in endometrioid-type endometrial adenocarcinomas. Unexpectedly, accumulation of the p53 protein itself may be important in cyclin A overexpression",

    "Title": "Tumor progression through epigenetic gene silencing of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase in human biliary tract cancers",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated in an immunohistochemical study that reduced expression of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) correlated with a poorer prognosis in patients with biliary tract cancers. The purpose of this study was to clarify how MGMT deficiency leads to a poor outcome in biliary tract cancer. Thus, we examined epigenetic (promoter methylation) and genetic (gene mutation) alterations in biliary tract cancer. METHODS: We examined 37 biliary tract cancer specimens from patients who underwent surgical resection. Promoter methylation was determined by one-step or two-step methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Gene mutation was identified by direct sequencing. The expression of MGMT protein in paraffin-embedded tissue was examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Frequencies of promoter methylation were 70% for p16/INK4a, 49% for MGMT, 46% for hMLH1, 41% for E-cadherin, and 32% for DAPK genes. MGMT methylation status was closely correlated with the MGMT protein expression determined by immunohistochemistry (P < .001). Although this was not statistically significant, biliary tract cancer tumors with MGMT methylation expressed multigene methylation more frequently than tumors without MGMT methylation (P = .071). A total of 33 mutations were identified in 4 cancer-related genes: p53, K-ras, beta-catenin, and p16/INK4a genes. The most common mutation was GC to AT transitions (58%), which were significantly associated with MGMT promoter methylation (P = .011). These findings suggest that loss of MGMT expression by promoter methylation results in accumulation of GC to AT gene mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced MGMT expression may increase the malignant potential of biliary tract cancer through both epigenetic and genetic mechanisms",

    "Title": "Comparative assessment of the functional p53 status in glioma cells",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers and its functional integrity is an important predictor of treatment response and clinical outcome. The majority of mutations found in different types of cancer cluster within the DNA binding domain encoded by exons 5-8. In clinical specimens the functional status of p53 is, therefore, often evaluated by direct mutation analysis of exons 5-8 or indirectly by immunostaining and evaluation of the subcellular localization pattern or protein accumulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a panel of glioma cell lines, the status of the P53 gene was analyzed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) of exons 5-8 and direct sequencing of all p53 exons. The nuclear accumulation of p53 in unstressed cells was assessed by immunostaining. These data were correlated with stress induction of the p53 protein, nuclear translocation and a direct determination of the transcriptional activity of endogenous p53 protein and induction of p53 target genes. RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrated that a p53 gene mutation analysis limited to exons 5-8 and analysis of immunostaining patterns can not serve as reliable predictors of functional p53 in tumor cells. Conversely, in some presumably rare cases, the transcriptional activity of p53 may be retained in tumor cells in the presence of a mutation and a pathological immunostaining pattern. In our analysis, the constitutive dephosphorylation at Ser 376 correlated with the nuclear accumulation of p53, but not with the transcriptional activity of the protein. This suggests that constitutive dephosphorylation at Ser376 may be one of the factors determining stabilization of mutant and wild-type p53, which is frequently observed in glial tumors. CONCLUSION: The incidence of a dysfunctional p53 protein in gliomas may be higher than expected, based on a single parameter evaluation by mutation analysis of exons 5-8 or assessment of p53 accumulation and subcellular localization by immunostaining",

    "Title": "Mutations in TP53, but not FGFR3, in urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder are influenced by smoking: contribution of exogenous versus endogenous carcinogens",
    "Abstract": "Smoking is a major risk factor for urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder (UCC). Mutations in the FGFR3 and TP53 genes have been shown to define two distinct pathways in superficial papillary and invasive UCC disease, respectively. We investigated the relationship between smoking and these mutations by means of denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and sequencing for 110 primary UCC of the bladder. This study included 48 current smokers, 31 ex-smokers and 31 non-smokers. Thirty-five of the tumors were stage pTa, 40 pT1 and 35 > or =pT2. Fourteen of the tumors were grade 1, 37 were grade 2 and 59 grade 3. Smoking was associated with high stage (P = 0.03) and high grade tumors (P = 0.006). Twenty-two of the 110 tumors studied harbored TP53 mutations (20%) and 43 harbored FGFR3 mutations (39%). Odds ratios (OR) were higher for TP53 mutations in current smokers [OR, 2.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.65-7.75] and ex-smokers (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 0.41-6.42) than in non-smokers. Double TP53 mutations and the A:T-->G:C TP53 mutation pattern was found only in current smokers. Patients with the FGFR3(wild-type)/TP53(mutated) genotype had significantly higher levels of tobacco consumption, as measured in pack-years (P = 0.01). Smoking influenced neither the frequency nor the pattern of FGFR3 mutations. Our results suggest that smoking is associated with invasive and high grade UCCs, at initial presentation, and influenced TP53 or the molecular pathway defined by these mutations. In contrast, FGFR3 mutations are not affected by smoking and probably result from endogenous alterations. These data have potential implications for clinical management and prevention strategies",

    "Title": "Polymorphisms in XPD and TP53 and mutation in human lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "The pattern of somatic mutations in TP53 is distinct for particular cancers and carcinogenic exposures, providing clues to disease etiology, e.g. G:C-->T:A mutations in TP53 are more frequently observed in smoking-associated lung cancers. In order to investigate possible causes and mechanisms of lung cancer susceptibility differences, the TP53 gene was sequenced in a case-only study of lung cancers (206 men and 103 women). Our primary hypothesis was that the TP53 mutation spectrum is influenced by polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA repair and apoptosis. We observed a TP53 mutation frequency in exons 5-8 of 25%. Functional polymorphisms in XPD (Asp312Asn, rs1799793 and Lys751Gln, rs1052559), a protein required for nucleotide excision repair and with roles in p53-mediated apoptosis, were modestly associated with G:C-->T:A mutations in TP53 in lung tumors [Asp/Asn312 + Asn/Asn312 and/or Lys/Gln751 + Gln/Gln751 versus Asp/Asp312 + Lys/Lys751; odds ratio (OR) 2.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-7.61], consistent with the role of this protein in repair of bulky carcinogen-DNA adducts. In addition, a TP53 polymorphism (Arg72Pro, rs1042522) with a known role in the efficiency of apoptosis was also associated with the presence of a TP53 mutation (Pro/Arg72 or Pro/Pro72 versus Arg/Arg72; OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.21-4.17) or a G:C-->T:A mutation in TP53 (Pro/Arg72 or Pro/Pro72 versus Arg/Arg72; OR 2.42, 95% CI 0.97-6.04). An interaction between the XPD variant alleles (Asn312 and Gln751) and the TP53 Pro72 allele was observed for TP53 mutations (any TP53 mutation P(int) = 0.027, G:C-->T:A TP53 mutation P(int) = 0.041). The statistical interaction observed in our study is consistent with the observed biological interaction for XPD and p53 in nucleotide excision repair and apoptosis. In conclusion, differences in TP53 mutation spectra in lung tumors are associated with several genetic factors and may reflect differences in lung cancer susceptibility and carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Evolution of intratumoral genetic heterogeneity during colorectal cancer progression",
    "Abstract": "Evolution of intratumoral genetic heterogeneity during colorectal tumor progression has not been investigated so far. Multiple sample areas in colorectal adenocarcinoma at early and advanced stages and in metastases were studied for the well-known genetic alterations: K-ras and p53 point mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosomes 5q and 18q. In primary colorectal cancers (CRCs), intratumoral genetic heterogeneity was more often observed in early than in advanced stages, at 90 and 67%, respectively. All but one of the advanced CRCs were composed of one predominant clone and other minor clones, whereas no predominant clone has been identified in half of the early cancers. At the early stage, the last events that were produced, the p53 mutation and LOH of 18q, were also the most heterogeneous. At the advanced stage, the LOH of 5q and 18q were the most frequent heterogeneous events (67 and 58%, respectively). The intratumoral heterogeneity for mutations was significantly reduced, from the early to the advanced stages (from 60 to 20% for K-ras and from 70 to 20% for p53). On the other hand, a quasi absence of intratumoral genetic heterogeneity was observed for K-ras and p53 in distant metastasis. In conclusion, colorectal adenocarcinomas are characterized by marked intratumoral genetic heterogeneity. A reduction of the intratumoral genetic heterogeneity for point mutations and a relative stability of the heterogeneity for allelic losses indicate that, during the progression of CRC, clonal selection and chromosome instability continue, while an increase cannot be proven",

    "Title": "Large B-cell lymphoma with Hodgkin's features",
    "Abstract": "AIMS: To describe the features of a series of nine cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) showing morphological and immunophenotypic features that are intermediate with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). METHODS AND RESULTS: Most cases (6/9) presented as mediastinal tumours affecting young males, while the other three cases arose in extramediastinal locations. Histopathologically, tumours showed diffuse large cell areas in a polymorphous background, with pleomorphic cytology and the common presence of Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg cells. Immunophenotypically, tumours shared features of DLBCL and classical HL, with expression of CD30, CD15 (6/9), and a full B-cell profile including CD45RB, CD20, CD79a and OCT2. Epstein-Barr virus-latent membrane protein expression was found in 2/9 cases. The majority of tumours had immunohistochemical features consistent with activation of the NF-(kappa)B pathway, including nuclear location of the c-REL/p65 subunit, overexpression of phosphorylated I(kappa)B(alpha), and overexpression of NF-(kappa)B targets. Finally, 2/9 cases showed 3q27 (BCL6) rearrangement, and 1/9 had p53 gene mutations, both of which are rarely detected in classical HL. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that DLBCLs with HL features constitute a distinctive subgroup of aggressive lymphomas whose neoplastic growth and peculiar characteristics could be facilitated by a particular microenvironment found in the mediastinum",

    "Title": "Laser pressure catapulting (LPC): optimization LPC-system and genotyping of colorectal carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Genotype analysis is becoming more and more useful in clinical practice, since specific mutations in tumors often correlate with prognosis and/or therapeutic response. Unfortunately, current molecular analytical techniques often require time-consuming and costly steps of analysis, thus making their routine clinical use difficult. Moreover, one of the most difficult problems arising during tumor research is that of their cell heterogeneity, which depends on their clear molecular heterogeneity. SSCP analysis discriminates by means of aberrant electrophoresis migration bands, mutated alleles which may represent as little as 15-20% of their total number. Nevertheless, in order to identify by sequencing the type of alteration revealed by this technique, only the mutated allele must be isolated. The advent of laser microdissection is a procedure which easily solves these problems of accuracy, costs, and time. The aims of this study were to perfect the system of laser pressure catapulting (LPC) laser microdissection for the assessment of the mutational status of p53 and k-ras genes in a consecutive series of 67 patients with colorectal carcinomas (CRC), in order to compare this technique with that involving hand-dissection and to demonstrate that since the LPC system guarantees more accurate biomolecular analyses, it should become part of clinical routine in this field. The LPC-system was perfected with the use of mineral oil and the LPC-membrane. To compare the techniques of hand- and LPC-microdissection, alcohol-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from 67 cases of CRC were both hand- and laser-microdissected. In either case, dissected samples were analyzed by SSCP/sequencing and direct sequencing for k-ras and p53 gene mutations. LPC-microdissection made it possible to pick up mutations by direct sequencing or SSCP/sequencing, whereas hand-microdissection mutations were identified only by means of SSCP followed by sequencing; direct sequencing did not reveal any mutation. In the 67 patients examined by either method, 36% (24/67) showed p53 mutations, 32 of which identified. Seventy-eight percent (25/32) were found in the conserved areas of the gene, while 12% (4/32) were in the L2 loop, 50% (16/32) were in the L3 loop, and 12% (4/32) in the LSH motif of the protein. Moreover, of the 67 cases examined, 40% (27/67) showed mutations in k-ras, with a total of 29 mutations identified. Of these, 14 (48%) were found in codon 12 and 15 (52%) in codon 13. The modifications which we brought to the LPC system led to a vast improvement of the technique, making it an ideal substitution for hand-microdissection and guaranteeing a considerable number of advantages regarding facility, accuracy, time, and cost. Furthermore, the data obtained from the mutational analyses performed confirm that the LPC system is more efficient and rapid than hand-microdissection for acquiring useful information regarding molecular profile and can therefore be used with success in clinical routine",

    "Title": "Mutation analysis of p53, K-ras, and BRAF genes in colorectal cancer progression",
    "Abstract": "Gene mutations in APC, K-ras, and p53 are thought to be essential events for colorectal cancer development. Recent data seem to indicate that K-ras and p53 mutations rarely co-exist in the same tumor, indicating that these alterations do not represent a synergistic evolutionary pathway. Moreover, an inverse relation between K-ras gene activation and BRAF mutations has been demonstrated, suggesting alternative pathways for colorectal cancer transformation. To reconstruct the chronological modulation of these gene mutations during cell transformation and colorectal cancer progression, mutations of p53, K-ras, and BRAF genes were analyzed by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) or sequencing analysis in 100 colorectal cancer samples, evenly distributed among different Dukes' stages. We found mutations in p53, K-ras, and BRAF genes in 35%, 30%, and 4% of tumors, respectively, and observed a minimal or no co-presence of these gene alterations. Moreover, the frequency of molecular p53 mutations increased as tumor stage increased, suggesting an important role for this gene in the progression of colorectal cancer. Conversely, K-ras or BRAF genes were not related to tumor stage or location. These data seem to indicate the absence of a co-presence of the genes, highlighting the possibility of multiple pathways for colorectal tumor progression. Moreover, mutations in p53, K-ras, and BRAF are not present in about one-third of colorectal cancers and therefore other gene mutations need to be investigated to better understand molecular mechanisms at the basis of cell transformation and the progression of colorectal cancer",

    "Title": "Reduced cisplatin sensitivity of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines correlates with mutations affecting the COOH-terminal nuclear localization signal of p53",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are the most frequent malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract. Cisplatin resistance is a major problem in the treatment of a large number of HNSCC cancer patients. In this study, nine randomly selected HNSCC cell lines were investigated regarding expression, presence of mutations, nucleocytoplasmic distribution of p53, and sensitivity to cisplatin. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Protein expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis. The whole open reading frame of p53 was determined by reverse transcription-PCR sequencing. Nucleocytoplasmic distribution was evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide viability assay was used to test for cisplatin sensitivity. RESULTS: p53 mutations were found in all nine investigated HNSCC cell lines. Nuclear p53 signal was detected in six cell lines, whereas three cell lines exhibited total loss of nuclear p53 signal. Nuclear signal depended on the presence or absence of the COOH-terminal nuclear localization signal in p53. Cisplatin sensitivity was highly reduced in the group with loss of nuclear p53 signal compared with those with detectable nuclear signal. Transfection of wild-type and mutant p53 into a rat embryonic cell system showed highly reduced activity of the nuclear localization signal mutant p53 protein. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data suggest that 'loss of nuclear p53 signal' correlates with cisplatin resistance in HNSCC. If these results can be validated on a larger number of tumor samples, including fresh tumor tissues, it potentially could help in sparing a subgroup of HNSCC patients the side effects associated with unnecessary chemotherapy by identifying cisplatin nonresponders before chemotherapy induction",

    "Title": "FGFR3 and Tp53 mutations in T1G3 transitional bladder carcinomas: independent distribution and lack of association with prognosis",
    "Abstract": "FGFR3 and Tp53 mutations have been proposed as defining two alternative pathways in the pathogenesis of transitional bladder cancer. FGFR3 mutations are associated with low-grade tumors and a favorable prognosis. Tp53 alterations are associated with advanced tumors and, possibly, with a poor prognosis. We focus here on the subgroup of T1G3 superficial tumors because they are a major clinical challenge. Patients (n = 119) were identified from a prospective study of 1,356 cases. Mutations in FGFR3 (exons 7, 10, and 15) and Tp53 (exons 4-9) were analyzed using PCR and direct sequencing. All cases were followed for recurrence and death. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox regression. FGFR3 mutations were detected in 20 (16.8%) tumors; 100 mutations in Tp53 were found in tumors from 78 (65.5%) cases. Multiple alterations in Tp53 were present in 19 tumors (16%). Inactivating mutations were present in 58% of tumors. The combined mutation distribution (FGFR3/Tp53) was: wt/wt (34.5%), mut/wt (7.6%), wt/mut (48.7%), and mut/mut (9.2%), indicating that the presence of either mutation did not depend on the other (P value = 0.767). FGFR3 and Tp53 mutations were not associated with clinicopathologic characteristics of patients and did not predict, alone or in combination, recurrence or survival. Taking the risk of the wt/wt group as reference, the mutation-associated risks of cancer-specific mortality were: mut/wt 1.42 (0.15-13.75), wt/mut 0.67 (0.19-2.31), mut/mut 1.62 (0.27-9.59). These molecular features support the notion that T1G3 tumors are at the crossroads of the two main molecular pathways proposed for bladder cancer development and progression",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To correlate TP53 mutations with angiogenic status of the tumor and prognosis after liver surgery in patients with colorectal liver metastases and to correlate immunohistochemical staining of p53 protein with TP53 gene mutations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumors of 44 patients with surgically treated colorectal liver metastases were analyzed for (a) TP53 mutations using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis followed by sequencing, (b) microvessel density using the hot spot overlap technique, (c) apoptotic rate in tumor cells and endothelial cells of tumor microvessels using double immunostaining for anti-cleaved caspase 3 and anti-CD34, and (d) expression of p53 protein using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: TP53 mutations were detected in 36% of the metastases and occurred more frequently in liver metastases from left-sided colon tumors than from right-sided colon tumors (P = 0.04). In metastases with TP53 mutations, microvessel density was higher compared with tumors with wild-type p53. Endothelial cell apoptosis was not different in tumor microvessels from TP53-mutated versus nonmutated tumors. The 5-year actual survival was not influenced by TP53 mutational status, microvessel density, or endothelial cell apoptotic rate of the tumors. Based on immunohistochemical p53 overexpression, the positive and negative predictive values of TP53 mutations were 61% and 82%. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with surgically treated colorectal liver metastases, TP53 mutations and angiogenic status did not influence prognosis. Immunohistochemistry is not a reliable technique for detecting TP53 mutations",

    "Title": "Assessment of the transcriptional activity of p53 improves the prediction of recurrence in superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the value of p53 functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast (FASAY) as a witness of p53/p21 pathway alteration and as a predictor of recurrence in superficial transitional cell carcinomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: p53 transcriptional activity was prospectively analyzed in 52 newly diagnosed transitional cell carcinoma using FASAY competent for the transactivation of p21 and bax promoters. TP53 and p21 gene expression was quantified by real-time PCR, and expression of corresponding proteins was assessed by immunohistochemistry. In addition to tumor stage and grade, the predictive value of FASAY, real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry for tumor recurrence was assessed by Cox survival analysis. RESULTS: A total (p21 and bax) or partial (bax only) loss of transcriptional activity was observed in 15 of 52 (29%) and 4 of 52 (7.7%) cases, respectively, a partial loss being consistently associated with R283H mutation. p53 nuclear overexpression grossly overestimated (approximately 40%) or underestimated (approximately 10%) the true incidence of p53 transcriptional abnormalities, especially in Ta-T1 grade 1 to 2 tumors. Loss of p21 transactivation significantly correlated with decreased p21 gene expression and lack of expression of p21 (P = 0.001). FASAY had a better predictive value for recurrence than p53 immunohistochemistry (Cox hazard ratio, 6.57 versus 3.95; P = 0.0002 versus 0.019, respectively), whereas neither p21 immunohistochemistry (hazard ratio, 1.9; P = 0.29) nor TP53 or p21 gene expression were significant predictors of recurrence. The prognostic difference between FASAY and p53 immunohistochemistry was maintained in the subgroup of Ta-T1 grade 3 tumors. CONCLUSIONS: FASAY is a valuable surrogate marker for assessing p53/p21 pathway alteration and predicts transitional cell carcinoma recurrence better than p53 immunohistochemistry",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Bladder tumors develop through different molecular pathways. Recent reports suggest activating mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene as marker for the 'papillary' pathway with good prognosis, in contrast to the more malignant 'carcinoma in situ' (CIS) pathway. The aim of this clinical follow-up study was to investigate the role of FGFR3 mutations in bladder cancer development in a longitudinal study. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We selected 85 patients with superficial bladder tumors, stratified into early (stage T(a)/grade 1-2, n = 35) and more advanced (either stage T(1) or grade 3, n = 50) developmental stages. The patients were followed prospectively, and metachronous tumors were included. We did screening for FGFR3 and TP53 mutations by direct bidirectional sequencing and for genome-wide molecular changes with microarray technology. RESULTS: A total of 43 of 85 cases (51%) showed activating mutations of FGFR3. The mutations were associated with papillary tumors of early developmental stage. However, after stratifying for developmental stage, FGFR3-mutated tumors showed the same malignant potential as wild-type tumors. Tumors with concomitant CIS were generally FGFR3 wild type. They were characterized by different patterns of chromosomal changes and gene expression signatures compared with FGFR3-mutated tumors, indicating different molecular pathways. CONCLUSIONS: FGFR3 mutations seem to have a central role in the early development of papillary bladder tumors. These tumors follow a common molecular pathway, which is different from tumors with concomitant CIS. FGFR3 mutations do not seem to play a role in bladder cancer progression",

    "Title": "Clinical relevance of dominant-negative p73 isoforms for responsiveness to chemotherapy and survival in ovarian cancer: evidence for a crucial p53-p73 cross-talk in vivo",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: We aimed to determine the clinical role of the p53 family members p53 and p73 in the responsiveness to platinum-based chemotherapy and survival in ovarian cancer, considering their cross-talk and the p53 polymorphism at codon 72. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A detailed analysis of p53 and p73 in a series of 122 ovarian cancers was done. We used a functional yeast-based assay to determine the p53 mutational status. Red yeast colonies, indicating mutant p53, were subsequently sequenced to determine the specific p53 alteration. p53 mutations were divided into two groups according to their previous characterization in the literature: those that efficiently inhibit transcriptionally active TAp73 function and those that do not. A p53 polymorphism at codon 72 was determined in corresponding normal tissue or blood of ovarian cancer patients. Isoform-specific p73 expression analysis using real-time reverse transcription-PCR has previously been done in the majority of ovarian cancers included in this study. In a retrospective chart review, responsiveness to chemotherapy was assessed, and survival data with long follow-up times were collected. RESULTS: Eighty of 122 (65.6%) of ovarian cancers harbored p53 mutations. p53 mutational status was an important determinant of responsiveness to platinum-based chemotherapy in all patients with a residual tumor of <2 cm in diameter after initial surgery (wild-type versus mutant, P = 0.029). In addition, p53 mutational status was a strong prognosticator for recurrence-free and overall survival (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.003, respectively) in univariate analyses. High expression levels of dominant-negative p73 isoforms (DeltaNp73 and DeltaN'p73) significantly correlated with chemotherapeutic failure (P = 0.048) and with worse recurrence-free and overall survival in patients with p53 mutant cancers (P = 0.048 and P = 0.005, respectively). Eight p53 mutations, present in 19 cases, were found that efficiently inhibit TAp73 (i.e., 175H, 220C, 245S, 245D, 248W, 248Q, 266E, and 273H). Patients with p53 mutations that efficiently inhibit TAp73 function had a significantly shorter overall survival than patients with p53 mutations of unknown effect on TAp73 (P = 0.044). The p53 polymorphism at codon 72 had no influence on responsiveness to chemotherapy or survival. CONCLUSION: We provide the first clinical evidence that dominant-negative p73 isoforms contribute to drug resistance in vivo, underscoring the importance of a p53-p73 cross-talk. NH2-terminally truncated p73 isoforms were of significant clinical effect by providing an additional unfavorable factor for response to platinum-based chemotherapy and survival in p53 mutant ovarian cancers",

    "Title": "The possible role of TP53 mutation status in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) with radiotherapy with different overall treatment times",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: TP53-mutations have been shown to influence the radiosensitivity of HNSCC. Furthermore, HNSCC with mutated TP53, may have a higher proliferative potential caused by a lack of control in G1 checkpoint. Our aim of the study was to identify the role of TP53 mutations for the outcome of radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: DNA extracted from 180 paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed pretreatment biopsies of HNSCC was screened for mutations in exon 4C-10 by denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography (DHPLC) followed by sequencing. Treatment was 66-68Gy, 2Gy/fx with overall treatment times of 6.5 and 5.5 weeks according to the DAHANCA-guidelines. Endpoints were local control at T-site, disease-specific and crude survival. RESULTS: 125 of 180 carcinomas (69%) carried in total 176 mutations. 72 carcinomas were WT (40%) and 108 carcinomas (60%) carried mutations giving dysfunctional p53. Overall, mutations in TP53 were not associated with the endpoints. However, when dichotomising according to TP53 status and evaluating the effect of the overall treatment time then tumours with mutant TP53 did benefit from 6 instead of 5fx/wk regarding local control, P=0.005; RR: 0.33 (C.I 95%:0.15-0.75) whereas WT-tumours did not (P=0.9). These observations were also reflected in the disease-specific and crude survival. CONCLUSIONS: If all patients were considered regardless of treatment schedule, then TP53-mutations were not related to local control or survival. However, mutations in TP53 may be associated with HNSCC that benefit of a reduced overall treatment time of radiotherapy",

    "Title": "INK4-ARF and p53 mutations in metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: case report and archival study on the use of Ink4a-ARF and p53 mutation analysis in identification of the corresponding primary tumor",
    "Abstract": "So far, histopathologic, immunohistochemical and molecular properties of metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (CSCCs) are relatively unexplored. In patients with multiple CSCCs, as for instance renal transplant recipients (RTRs), it might prove difficult to identify the primary tumor responsible for metastasis. We report a case of an RTR with multiple CSCCs, one of which metastasized. By using p53 and INK4a-ARF mutation analysis, we identified the responsible primary tumor due to an identical mutation in exon 2 of the INK4a-ARF locus. Archival study yielded 14 cases of metastatic CSCC (present case included). In only 8 of 14 metastases, DNA quality was sufficient to perform PCR reactions. In 7 of 8 metastases, either an INK4a-ARF (6 of 8 cases) and/or p53 (3 of 8 cases) mutation was present. In 6 of 7 cases, the corresponding primary could be identified by an identical mutation in p53 and/or INK4a-ARF. In conclusion, molecular analysis using a combination of p53 and INK4a-ARF mutation analysis can identify the corresponding primary skin tumor in case of CSCC metastases in the majority of cases. This is facilitated by the high frequency of these mutations in metastatic CSCC when compared with frequency spectra reported in the literature in primary CSCCs. The major limitation was formed by insufficient DNA quality in archival tissue",

    "Title": "Patterns of p53 mutations separate ovarian serous borderline tumors and low- and high-grade carcinomas and provide support for a new model of ovarian carcinogenesis: a mutational analysis with immunohistochemical correlation",
    "Abstract": "The infrequent association of serous borderline tumors (SBTs) with invasive serous carcinoma has led to the view that SBTs are unrelated to invasive serous carcinoma. Nonetheless, mortality associated with SBTs is generally attributed to malignant transformation, and traditionally these tumors have been designated as 'carcinomas of low malignant potential.' Previous immunohistochemical studies evaluating p53 expression and molecular genetic studies evaluating mutational status have reported that p53 overexpression and mutations are infrequent in SBTs and occur in as many as 50% to 80% of invasive serous carcinomas. The different methodologies for determining p53 status and the failure to correlate the findings with tumor grade make these studies difficult to interpret. The current study was undertaken to overcome these deficiencies and to reconcile the relationship of SBTs to invasive serous carcinoma by performing a morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic analysis comparing SBTs with low- and high-grade serous carcinoma. The molecular genetic analysis used a highly stringent, carefully designed nucleotide-sequencing method. A total of 96 sporadic serous tumors including 25 SBTs (11 atypical proliferative serous tumors and 14 intraepithelial low-grade serous carcinomas [noninvasive micropapillary serous carcinomas, MPSCs]), 12 low-grade serous carcinomas (invasive MPSCs), and 59 high-grade serous carcinomas were analyzed for their p53 mutational status of exons 5 to 9. Functional mutations, defined as mutations resulting in the alteration of the structure of the encoded protein, were detected in 30 of 59 (50.8%) high-grade serous carcinomas and 1 (8.3%) of 12 low-grade invasive serous carcinomas compared with 2 (8%) of 25 SBTs, both of these in intraepithelial low-grade serous carcinomas (noninvasive MPSCs). The similar frequency of p53 mutations in SBTs and low-grade invasive serous carcinomas in contrast to the significantly higher frequency of p53 mutations in high-grade serous carcinomas (P < 0.0005) suggests a common lineage for SBTs and low-grade invasive serous carcinomas and supports the view that SBTs are unrelated to the usual type of invasive serous carcinoma, which is a high-grade neoplasm. Mutational status was also correlated with p53 immunoreactivity. Although p53 immunoreactivity is generally higher in those specimens containing mutant p53, immunostaining is neither sufficiently specific nor sensitive enough to predict p53 mutations. The molecular genetic findings confirm our hypothesis of dual pathways of serous carcinogenesis based on previous analyses of KRAS and BRAF mutations on the same set of cases in which KRAS and BRAF mutations were found in 60% of SBTs and low-grade serous carcinoma but not in high-grade serous carcinomas. Based on these studies, we have proposed a model of serous carcinogenesis in which SBTs are the precursors of low-grade serous carcinomas whereas the usual type of invasive serous carcinoma is a high-grade neoplasm that develops 'de novo' from in situ alterations in epithelial inclusion cysts",

    "Abstract": "Molecular parameters involved in the prediction of response of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are still unclear. We have evaluated the expression and mutational status of p53 and the expression of bcl-x(L) and bax in a series of 62 consecutive children (median age: 4 years; 38 males and 24 females) affected by de novo ALL. Alterations and overexpression of p53 were uncommon events (9/62, 14.5%) while bcl-x(L) and bax overexpression were frequent (about 70%). EFS was directly correlated to age<6 years (p=0.0178), nonT phenotype (p=0.0470), WBC at diagnosis<or=20000/microl (p=0.0093), response to induction therapy with prednisone (p=0.0211) and inversely correlated to mutated p53 or overexpression of p53 (p=0.0039) and high intensity of Bcl-xL expression (p=0.0055). OS was directly correlated with age<6 years (p=0.0004), female gender (p=0.0139), nonT phenotype (p=0.0012), WBC at diagnosis<or=20000/microl (p=0.0187), response to induction therapy with prednisone (p=0.0211), wild type p53 or low expression of p53 (p=0.035). When all factors were considered in a stepwise Cox regression analysis, only the good response to PDN (p=0.013) and the low intensity of Bcl-xL expression (p=0.001) were independent significant prognostic factors with regard to EFS. Moreover, only age (p=0.022), gender (p=0.036) and WBC at the diagnosis (p=0.050) were independent prognostic factors with regard to OS. Moreover, the mutated status of p53 was statistically correlated to the resistance to the induction therapy with PDN (correlation coefficient: -0.349, p=0.008). In conclusion, both bcl-xL and bax were frequently expressed at high intensity, but only bcl-xL was an independent predictor of EFS in our series. Moreover, p53 alterations were uncommon and alone not strong independent predictors of outcome, but they were correlated to poor response to therapy with PDN and inversely correlated to EFS and OS in univariate analysis",

    "Title": "Mutation and methylation analysis of TP53 in adrenal carcinogenesis",
    "Abstract": "AIM: To investigate the role of coding region mutation and promoter hypermethylation of TP53 in adrenocortical cancer formation. METHODS: Twenty sporadic adrenocortical cancers (ACCs) and five normal adrenal tissue samples were available for analysis. Coding region mutation of TP53 in 20 ACCs was examined by polymerase chain amplification using intronic primers for exons 2-11 and direct sequencing of the product. In 10 ACCs and five normal adrenal tissue specimens, methylation of the 16 CpG sites within the TP53 promoter was examined using bisulphite methylation sequencing. RESULTS: Coding region mutation in TP53 was demonstrated in 5 of 20 ACCs. There were four mis-sense mutations and one frameshift mutation. Four of 5 patients with a TP53 mutation had metastases at diagnosis or detected soon thereafter and 3 of 4 died of disease within 12 months of surgical resection. No methylation was seen in the TP53 promoter in 10 ACC and the five normal adrenal tissues examined. CONCLUSION: Coding region mutation in TP53 occurs in 25% of ACCs with a trend toward a poorer prognosis. Promoter methylation of TP53 is not present in ACC as a mechanism for tumour suppressor gene (TSG) inactivation and, therefore, other genes in the 17p13 region are implicated in adrenal carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Molecular analysis to detect pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in high-risk groups",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Screening of high-risk groups for pancreatic cancer has not been adopted because of concerns regarding specificity and sensitivity. Suitability of a combination of 3 novel molecular screening techniques was investigated. METHODS: Pancreatic juice was extracted from 146 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, chronic pancreatitis, or biliary tract stones. p53 mutations were analyzed by using a modified yeast functional assay, K-ras status was analyzed using mutation-specific real-time PCR and the proportion of p16(INK4a) promoter methylation was estimated using comparative methylation-specific real-time PCR. RESULTS: p53 mutations were detected in 20 of 48 (42%) cancer cases, none of 49 controls, and 2 of 49 (4%) patients with pancreatitis. K-ras mutations were detected in 31 of 57 (54%) cancer patients, 13 of 61 (21%) controls, and 23 of 67 (34%) patients with pancreatitis. Twenty-six of 42 (62%) cancer patients had promoter methylation levels > 12%, compared with 3 of 24 (13%) controls, and 2 of 26 (8%) with pancreatitis. Mutations in p53 or high-level p16(INK4a) promoter methylation occurred in 29 of 36 (80%) patients with cancer, 3 of 24 (13%) controls, and 3 of 22 (13%) with pancreatitis. Three patients (8%) of 36 with cancer; 14 of 24 (58%) controls, and 13 of 22 (59%) patients with pancreatitis had no marker. The gallstone disease patients had a high rate of positive K-ras mutations, possibly reflecting the fact that they were not disease free. CONCLUSIONS: Combination molecular analysis increased the discrimination between patients with malignant and benign disease. This level of discrimination would allow patients in high-risk groups to be stratified from negligible risk to over 50% probability of an early cancer",

    "Title": "Gene-expression profiling predicts recurrence in Dukes' C colorectal cancer",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although approximately 50% of Dukes' C colorectal cancer patients are surgically cured, it is currently not possible to distinguish these patients from those at high risk of recurrence. The recent advent of routine adjuvant chemotherapy for these patients has greatly complicated the identification of new markers predicting the response to surgery, which is now reliant on archived materials. Microarray analysis allows fine tumor classification but cannot be used with paraffin-embedded archival samples. METHODS: We used microarray analysis of a unique set of fresh-frozen tumor samples from Dukes' C patients who had surgery as the only form of treatment to identify molecular signatures that characterize tumors from patients with good and bad prognosis. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and a K-nearest neighbors-based classifier identified groups of patients with significantly different survival (P = .019 and P = .0001). Expression profiling outperformed previously reported genetic markers of prognosis such as TP53 and K-RAS mutational status and allelic imbalance in chromosome 18q, which were of limited prognostic power in this study. Functional categories significantly enriched in gene-expression differences included protein transport and folding. The prognostic potential of the RAS homologue RHOA, one of the most differentially expressed genes, was further investigated using immunohistochemistry and a tissue microarray containing 137 independent Dukes' C tumor samples. Reduced RHOA expression was associated with significantly shorter survival (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that gene-expression profiling of surgical tumor samples can predict recurrence in Dukes' C patients. Therefore, this approach could be used to guide decisions concerning the clinical management of these patients",

    "Abstract": "Primary small-cell carcinoma (SmCC) is extremely rare in stomach. We reported an autopsy case of combined gastric SmCC with p53 and K-ras mutational analysis. Histologically, the tumour was composed of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma surrounding the central dominant SmCC component with scattered nests of squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemically, all the neoplastic components revealed strong expression for p53 protein. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that these histologically different components originated from a same progenitor cell that possessed p53 mutation. Using Laser-capture microdissection technique and mutational analysis, we identified the same point mutations of p53 gene (A-->G transversion in codon 239) and K-ras gene (G-->A transversion in codon 13) in all the neoplastic components, but not in the adjacent normal gastric epithelium. Our results strongly support a hypothesis that the combined SmCC of stomach in this case was of monoclonal origin",

    "Abstract": "To investigate the interaction between DNA abnormalities, p53 and p16 gene mutations, and methylation and protein expression, 20 cancer cell lines were examined by Western blotting. A clear relation was found to exist between p53 accumulation and mutation status. Of 20 cell lines examined, 14 demonstrated p53 homozygous mutations in exons 3-10, including 12 missense mutations, one nonsense mutation, and one frameshift mutation. Overexpression of p53 was always linked to missense mutations in exons 6-8. Intermediate expression of p53 was noted in cells with missense mutations or polymorphism to proline at codon 72 in exons 4-5, whereas there was slight or no visible expression in wild type cells and in cells with nonsense and frameshift mutations. DNA aberration in the p16 promoter gene correlated significantly with protein expression of the p16 suppressor gene. Overexpression was noted in six cell lines, intermediate expression in two, and slight or no visible expression in 12. Methylation-caused disappearance of p16 protein was noted in 40% (8/20) of the cell lines. Of six cell lines overexpressing p16 protein, two could be amplified with primers for both unmethylated and methylated forms in a methylation-specific RCP analysis. One cell line with no visible expression could also be amplified with both primers. Overexpression or disappearance of p16 protein may readily occur when one of two alleles has been methylated",

    "Title": "Pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung associated with loss of heterozygosity of p53 gene",
    "Abstract": "We report a case with pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung in a 70-year-old man. Pleomorphic carcinoma is characterized by a heterogenous composition that includes epithelial and mesechymal malignancies. In the present case, the tumor was composed of a mixture of unequivocal squamous cell carcinoma and spindle cell components resembling sarcomatous overgrowth. The spindle component did not include a heterologous mesenchymal element characterized by overt differentiation for bone, cartilage, neuron or muscle tissue. To evaluate a state of differentiation of the spindle cell component, we immunohistochemically examined expression of the antigens including vimentin, cytokeratin, sarcomeric actin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, S-100 protein, CD34, Factor VIII, and CD68. The results showed sole expression of vimentin in the spindle cell component, suggesting an immature state of the mesenchymal lineage. Furthermore, the spindle cell component of this case was genetically characterized by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at a codon 234 of exon 7 of the p53 gene. This mutation causes an amino-acid replacement (Tyr to Cys), which was previously proven to attenuate p53 function. The present case may suggest a relation between somatic alteration of the p53 gene and histogenesis of pleomorphic carcinoma",

    "Title": "Two modes of microsatellite instability in human cancer: differential connection of defective DNA mismatch repair to dinucleotide repeat instability",
    "Abstract": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is associated with defective DNA mismatch repair in various human malignancies. Using a unique fluorescent technique, we have observed two distinct modes of dinucleotide microsatellite alterations in human colorectal cancer. Type A alterations are defined as length changes of < or =6 bp. Type B changes are more drastic and involve modifications of > or =8 bp. We show here that defective mismatch repair is necessary and sufficient for Type A changes. These changes were observed in cell lines and in tumours from mismatch repair gene-knockout mice. No Type B instability was seen in these cells or tumours. In a panel of human colorectal tumours, both Type A MSI and Type B instability were observed. Both types of MSI were associated with hMSH2 or hMLH1 mismatch repair gene alterations. Intriguingly, p53 mutations, which are generally regarded as uncommon in human tumours of the MSI+ phenotype, were frequently associated with Type A instability, whereas none was found in tumours with Type B instability, reflecting the prevailing viewpoint. Inspection of published data reveals that the microsatellite instability that has been observed in various malignancies, including those associated with Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), is predominantly Type B. Our findings indicate that Type B instability is not a simple reflection of a repair defect. We suggest that there are at least two qualitatively distinct modes of dinucleotide MSI in human colorectal cancer, and that different molecular mechanisms may underlie these modes of MSI. The relationship between MSI and defective mismatch repair may be more complex than hitherto suspected",

    "Title": "p53-defective tumors with a functional apoptosome-mediated pathway: a new therapeutic target",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although cancer cells appear to maintain the machinery for intrinsic apoptosis, defects in the pathway develop during malignant transformation, preventing apoptosis from occurring. How to specifically induce apoptosis in cancer cells remains unclear. METHODS: We determined the apoptosome activity and p53 status of normal human cells and of lung, colon, stomach, brain, and breast cancer cells by measuring cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation and by DNA sequencing, respectively, and we used COMPARE analysis to identify apoptosome-specific agonists. We compared cell death, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation in NCI-H23 (lung cancer), HCT-15 (colon cancer), and SF268 (brain cancer) cells treated with Triacsin c, an inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), or with vehicle. The cells were mock, transiently, or stably transfected with genes for Triacsin c-resistant ACSL5, dominant negative caspase-9, or apoptotic protease activating factor-1 knockdown. We measured ACS activity and levels of cardiolipin, a mitochondrial phospholipid, in mock and ACSL5-transduced SF268 cells. Nude mice carrying NCI-H23 xenograft tumors (n = 10) were treated with Triacsin c or vehicle, and xenograft tumor growth was assessed. Groups were compared using two-sided Student t tests. RESULTS: Of 21 p53-defective tumor cell lines analyzed, 17 had higher apoptosome activity than did normal cells. Triacsin c selectively induced apoptosome-mediated death in tumor cells (caspase activity of Triacsin c-treated versus untreated SF268 cells; means = 1020% and 100%, respectively; difference = 920%, 95% CI = 900% to 940%; P<.001). Expression of ACSL5 suppressed Triacsin c-induced cytochrome c release and subsequent cell death (cell survival of Triacsin c-treated mock- versus ACSL5-transduced SF268 cells; means = 40% and 83%, respectively; difference = 43%, 95% CI = 39% to 47%; P<.001). ACS was also essential to the maintenance of cardiolipin levels. Finally, Triacsin c suppressed growth of xenograft tumors (relative tumor volume on day 21 of Triacsin c-treated versus untreated mice; means = 4.6 and 9.6, respectively; difference = 5.0, 95% CI = 2.1 to 7.9; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: Many p53-defective tumors retain activity of the apoptosome, which is therefore a potential target for cancer chemotherapy. Inhibition of ACS may be a novel strategy to induce the death of p53-defective tumor cells",

    "Title": "Association of p53 mutations and a codon 72 single nucleotide polymorphism with lower overall survival and responsiveness to adjuvant radiotherapy in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "p53 Genetic alterations are associated with advanced stage and aggressive tumors in a variety of human malignancies. The aim of this study was to examine p53 for genetic alterations and to evaluate the association of these alterations with clinical outcome and response to adjuvant radiotherapy in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas. p53 mutations in exons 2-11 were assessed in 59 endometrioid carcinomas by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequence analysis. Twelve mutations (20.3%) and nine polymorphisms were identified. Seven of the nine polymorphisms were codon 72 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with an Arg/Pro allelotype. Women harboring either a mutation or an Arg/Pro allelotype at codon 72 had a lower overall survival rate than women whose tumors lacked alterations in the p53 gene (P= 0.0029). Women were stratified based on p53 genetic alterations (p53 mutation or p53 codon 72 SNP) and whether or not they received adjuvant radiation therapy. Women with p53 genetic alterations who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy had the lowest survival rate (P= 0.0005). Treated women with p53 genetic alterations and untreated women with no p53 alteration had similar rates of survival. Among women with p53 alterations, adjuvant radiotherapy substantially increased survival (P= 0.035). In multivariate analyses, the group of women with p53 genetic alterations who did not receive adjuvant radiation therapy had a 5.9-fold increased risk of death (95% confidence interval: 1.5-22.7) compared to women whose tumors lacked p53 alterations and did not receive adjuvant radiation therapy",

    "Title": "A comparative study of P53/MDM2 genes alterations and P53/MDM2 proteins immunoreactivity in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "In the present study, the expression of P53 and MDM2 proteins were examined in specimens from a group of 20 patients (9 with primary hepatocellular carcinoma HCC and 11 with liver cirrhosis LC, linked to HBV infections as a major aetiologic factor) by immunohistochemistry. The immunostaining findings were correlated with P53 mutation analysis using PCR-SSCP, PCR-HDF and direct sequencing, and MDM2 amplification studies by differential PCR. P53 immunopositivity was found in 9 out of the 20 (45.0%) cases. Mutations of the P53 gene were detected in 5 (55%) tumors and 3 (27%) LC samples; 7 of these cases revealed P53 immunoreactivity. The mutations were base transitions at codons 175, 245 and 273; no changes were observed at codon 249, characteristic for aflatoxins action. MDM2 immunopositivity was revealed in 9 out of 20 (45.0%) specimens. MDM2 amplification occurred in 4 (44.4%) and 1 (9.1%) cases, HCC and LC specimens respectively; only in 2 tumors (10.0%), which exhibited MDM2 immunoreactivity. Overall, MDM2 positivity was not associated with MDM2 amplification in 7 out of the 20 studied samples (35.0%). Two HCC patients were found to have both gene abnormalities. Either the mutation rate of the P53 gene as well as the amplification level of the MDM2 gene was higher in HCC than in precancerous liver tissue stages. These results support the notion that besides P53 alterations, MDM2 gene deregulation seems to be an important event in hepatocarcinogenesis. Additionally, the mechanism of MDM2-mediated degradation of P53 protein, without involving stabilization and inactivation of P53 gene, should be considered for the understanding of all features of tumor progression processes",

    "Abstract": "We report here the mutational analysis of hSNF5/INI1 and TP53 genes performed on 11 specimens of choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC) in which a large number of abnormalities has been detected by molecular biology techniques. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis performed on six tumors revealed losses on chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 13, 16, 18, and 22. However, there were no abnormalities on 17p and mutations of the TP53 gene have been observed for two tumors comprising exons 5 and 7, respectively. Exon 4 of hSNF5/INI1 was mutated in one tumor with LOH restricted to the hSNF5/INI1 locus. There was no coexistence of mutations in both analyzed genes. Our analysis confirms the presence of the hSNF5/INI1 mutations and proves involvement of TP53 mutations in sporadic cases of CPC",

    "Title": "Who takes the lead in the development of ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancers: mutator, suppressor, or methylator pathway?",
    "Abstract": "Although several genetic alterations have been identified in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), it remains unclear whether these changes indicate an increased risk for malignancy. This paper analyzes the involvement of suppressor, mutator, and methylator pathways in malignant transformation associated with UC. A total of 60 colonic samples (47 affected non-neoplastic mucosa, 7 dysplasia, and 6 carcinoma) from 51 UC patients were analyzed for 22 microsatellite markers. p53 gene exons 5-8 were analyzed by single-strand conformational polymorphism, and APC gene by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (exons 1-14) and protein truncation test (exon 15). Methylation studies for MLH1 and CSPG2 genes were also performed. Microsatellite instability was absent in all samples whereas allelic imbalance (AI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) were detected mainly in samples with neoplastic transformation (P<0.0001). AI and/or LOH at loci located on chromosomes 5, 9, and 18 were significantly more frequent in neoplastic samples (P<0.01), as were TP53 gene mutations (P<0.007). A single mutation was detected for APC gene in a cancer sample. MLH1 gene methylation was absent in all analyzed samples, whereas CSPG2 gene methylation was detected in a single non-neoplastic sample. Our results suggest that the suppressor pathway plays the main role in UC associated tumorigenic progression. LOH at specific loci located on chromosomes 5, 9, and 18 appears to be specifically associated with malignancy risk",

    "Title": "Amplification and overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor gene in glioblastomas of Chinese patients correlates with patient's age but not with tumor's clinicopathological pathway",
    "Abstract": "It is believed that there are two distinct pathological pathways leading to the development of human glioblastomas (GBM) in Caucasian populations. Primary (de novo) GBM most often occurs in older individuals, and is characterized by the overexpression/amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR), whereas secondary GBM, which progresses from a low-grade astrocytoma, often affects younger individuals and frequently contains the TP53 mutation. We and others have previously found that the age of onset of GBM in Chinese patients tends to be younger than that in Caucasian patients. To identify whether GBMs from Chinese patients share this common pattern of genetic alterations, expression levels of EGFR and TP53 and TP53 mutation were analyzed in 56 randomly selected Chinese GBMs (30 primary and 26 secondary), including 47 adult-onset and 9 pediatric GBMs. Consistent with other studies, overexpression/mutation of TP53 and aneuploid DNA content were more frequently detected in secondary GBMs of Chinese adult patients. In contrast to that observed in Caucasian patients, no significant difference was observed in the age distribution and the frequency of EGFR overexpression/amplification between primary and secondary GBMs in adult Chinese patients. Furthermore, the overexpression of EGFR was much higher in late-onset (age >45 years) GBMs (73%) than that in both early-onset (age 18-45 years) (17%) and pediatric (age <18 years) GBMs (11%), suggesting that overexpression of EGFR in Chinese GBMs may be associated closely with the patients age but not with the tumors' pathological pathway",

    "Title": "Low-level microsatellite instability phenotype in sporadic glioblastoma multiforme",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Genetic instability is a hallmark of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a significant event in the tumorigenesis of many sporadic malignancies. The aim of our investigation was to study microsatellite instability in newly diagnosed glioblastomas.METHODS: MSI was investigated in 109 GBMs with 15 microsatellite markers. Immunohistochemistry was performed for the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins hMLH1, hMSH2, hPMS2, and hMSH6 in cases showing MSI. Sequence and promoter methylation status of hMLH1 were analyzed in the case of a decreased hMLH1 protein expression as well. To further investigate MSI(+) GBMs we carried out studies of LOH at selected chromosome regions, EGFR amplification, and sequence of p53 and PTEN.RESULTS: MSI was observed in six GBMs (5.5%) and it was more frequent in GBMs with a previous lower grade astrocytoma (18.8% vs. 3.2%). MMR protein staining was positive in all MSI(+) GBMs except in one case, which showed an aberrant expression of hMLH1 and hPMS2 without hMLH1 inactivation. Among MSI(+) GBMs, one tumor corresponded to the GBM molecular type 1 (p53 mutation, no EGFR amplification), another tumor to type 2 (wild-type p53, EGFR amplification), and four tumors to neither type (wild-type p53, no EGFR amplification). None of the six tumors carried a PTEN mutation.CONCLUSIONS: MSI in GBM might be caused by inactivation of minor MMR genes rather than by a deficiency of hMLH1 or hMSH2 and it appears not to play a decisive role in the pathogenesis of these tumors. MSI(+) GBMs predominantly showed a profile which included wild-type of p53 and PTEN and absence of EGFR amplification but MSI occurred in all GBM molecular subtypes",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme WHO grade IV is the most common and malignant variant of astrocytic tumors. Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 10 and mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN on 10q are molecular hallmarks of glioblastomas. Recently, mutations were identified in PIK3CA, encoding a protein that antagonizes the function of PTEN protein in the PI3K/Akt pathway. To address the question whether an exclusive mutation pattern can be observed in PIK3CA and PTEN, we determined the frequency of mutations in both genes. All coding exons were examined by single strand confirmation polymorphism and direct sequencing. Additionally, we analyzed chromosome 10 for loss of heterozygosity and evaluated the mutational status of TP53. In 70 glioblastomas, 5 (7%) PIK3CA mutations and 10 (14%) PTEN mutations were found. All mutations in PIK3CA located to exons 1, 9 and 20, thereby supporting the concept of mutational hot spot regions. In all but one glioblastoma, mutations were seen either in PIK3CA or in PTEN. In conclusion, the frequency of PIK3CA mutations in glioblastomas appears to be much lower than initially reported",

Spinal magnetic resonance imaging showed extended intradural, extramedullary, contrast-enhancing masses with compression of the myelon. Spinal leptomeningeal biopsy revealed a pilocytic astrocytoma WHO grade I. Despite chemotherapy with vincristin and carboplatin, the patient died 2 months after admission. A thorough autopsy showed no evidence for primary neoplasms in brain, spine and optic nerve. Sequence analysis of tumor protein 53 gene (TP53) revealed a missense mutation in exon 5, and expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (mutated in multiple advanced cancers 1) (PTEN) protein was not detected, which may have contributed to astrocytoma development. To our knowledge, this is the first definitive case of pilocytic astrocytoma presenting as PDLG",

    "Abstract": "DKK1 protein belongs to a family of inhibitors of the Wnt/beta1-catenin signaling pathway. Sporadic mutations affecting almost each major player of the Wnt/beta1-catenin pathway have been described in a variety of human carcinomas. DKK1 translation can be induced by p53, thereby linking TP53 and Wnt/beta1-catenin signaling pathways. These findings raise questions in regard to human gliomas, which similar to carcinomas carry a high rate of mutations in TP53. To analyze DKK1 for its role in initiation or progression, we screened a series of 73 brain tumors for structural alterations in the entire coding sequence by single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. While several sequence variants were detected, there were no obvious mutations affecting DKK1. Further, we analyzed the prevalence of mRNA from TP53, DKK1 and CTNNB1 and of p53 and beta1-catenin protein in a series of human gliomas with and without mutations in TP53. Transcription and expression of CTNNB1/beta1-catenin and DKK1 proved to be independent of TP53/p53. These data support in vivo function of DKK1, independent of p53, in human gliomas with no major impact on their pathogenesis",

    "Title": "Somatic genetic changes accompanying lung tumor development",
    "Abstract": "Carcinomas are believed to develop by incremental steps of increasingly abnormal morphology driven by accumulating somatic genetic changes. This process is often difficult to study, as the early stages are undetectable. We used fluorescence bronchoscopy, which enhances detection of preinvasive bronchial lesions, and have obtained sequential biopsies of carcinoma in situ (CIS) from a patient with no detectable tumor and from a squamous cell carcinoma that developed 19 months after presentation at the site of one of the previous CIS lesions. Biopsies of preinvasive CIS, which follow-up showed had different pathologic outcomes, and tumor were microdissected to obtain enriched cell populations and DNA prepared from them. Molecular characteristics of these biopsies were compared by loss of heterozygosity analysis, TP53 mutation analysis, and comparative genomic hybridization. Although all lesions examined had the same TP53 mutation and almost identical allelotypes, differences were observed. Loss in 5q21 and amplification of 3q25-26 were associated with the lesion that progressed and the subsequent carcinoma. Allele loss at 4p16 was detected in the tumor but not in any of the CIS lesions, suggesting it was a late event associated with tumor invasion. Amplification at 4q12 was specifically observed in the tumor and in the CIS at the site of eventual tumor formation. Although these findings may be unique to this one patient, the successful demonstration of sequential genetic changes raises the possibility that this approach, unencumbered by interpatient variability between lesions, will greatly facilitate the identification of molecular events driving the invasive process",

Among 18 patients with a normal karyotype, no cryptic chromosome aberrations were observed with M-FISH. In 56 patients with a previously solved abnormal karyotype, only 17 new aberrations were identified, whereas 153 new aberrations were detected by M-FISH in 42 patients with a previously unsolved karyotype. In total, 112 of the new aberrations were unbalanced translocations, and only nine were balanced translocations. A clustering of breakpoints was observed in the centromeric or pericentromeric region of chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 13, 17, 21, and 22 in 48 of 98 patients with t-MDS and t-AML and an abnormal karyotype, and was related to previous therapy with alkylating agents. In seven of eight patients with chromosome derivatives containing material from three or more chromosomes or having sandwichlike chromosomes, those made up of several small interchanging layers of material from two chromosomes showed mutations of TP53.

    "Abstract": "The p53 gene plays a major role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Acquired mutations may provide clues to etiology, as some carcinogenic agents are associated with specific genetic changes in p53. Our aim was to analyze the spectrum of p53 mutations in tumor tissues from subjects with HCC in Egypt, where there is a rising incidence of HCC due to hepatitis C virus (HCV). We collected tumor tissues from 41 subjects with HCC diagnosed at the National Cancer Institute of Cairo University during 2000-2003. Sequence mutations were analyzed by the Affymetrix GeneChip technique. HCV RNA was detected in the sera of 37 subjects (90%). Only one patient had a current HBV infection. A total of 17 of the 41 subjects (41%) had p53 mutations. Thirteen of these were in exon 7, of which 10 were in codon 249, but only 8 of the 10 were the R249S mutation, previously reported to be associated with aflatoxin exposure. The other three exon 7 mutations were found in codons 232, 242 and 248. A total of three mutations were detected in exon 5 codons 133, 144 and 176. One mutation was detected in exon 8 codon 275. Unlike previous studies, this population is characterized by a high prevalence of chronic HCV infection. The presence of the R249S mutation in exon 7 may indicate that these subjects with HCC have been exposed to aflatoxin (AFB1), and further investigation is in progress to measure AFB1-albumin adducts in the sera of these subjects",

    "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) on telomerase activity in a panel of human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) cell lines. Addition of TGF-beta1 decreased the telomerase activity in HTh 74 and KTC-1 cells, while in C 643 and HTh 7 an increased activity was observed. The decreased telomerase activity appeared to be due to transcriptional repression of the hTERT promoter. Addition of a PI-3 kinase inhibitor (LY294002) abrogated the stimulatory effect of TGF-beta1 on the telomerase activity, indicating the possible involvement of hTERT activation via phosphorylation. Furthermore, the MEK-inhibitor U0126 had similar effects suggesting dual regulatory mechanisms. Interestingly, the cell lines differed genetically in that ATC cell lines responding with increased telomerase activity harbored a p53 mutation. In conclusion, TGF-beta1 exerts opposing effects on telomerase activity in ATC cell lines, possibly reflecting deregulation of TGF-beta1 signaling in a more malignant genotype",

    "Title": "Persistent inhibition of telomerase reprograms adult T-cell leukemia to p53-dependent senescence",
    "Abstract": "The antiviral thymidine analog azidothymidine (AZT) is used to treat several virus-associated human cancers. However, to date the mechanism of AZT action remains unclear and thus, reasons for treatment failure are unknown. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive malignancy of poor prognosis. Here, we report that enduring AZT treatment of T-cell leukemia virus I-infected cells, in vitro and in vivo in ATL patients, results in inhibition of telomerase activity, progressive telomere shortening, and increased p14(ARF) expression. In turn, this elicits stabilization and reactivation of the tumor suppressor p53-dependent transcription, increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1), and accumulation of p27(kip1), thereby inducing cellular senescence and tumor cell death. While ATL patients carrying a wild-type p53 enter remission following treatment with AZT, those with a mutated p53 did not respond, and patients' disease relapse was associated with the selection of a tumor clone carrying mutated inactive p53",

    "Title": "A nonreplicating adenoviral vector that contains the wild-type p53 transgene combined with chemotherapy for primary breast cancer: safety, efficacy, and biologic activity of a novel gene-therapy approach",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND.: Primary systemic therapy (PST) is the standard approach to the management of patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). The authors hypothesized that the intratumoral administration of a nonreplicating adenoviral vector (Ad5) that contains the human wild-type p53, AdCMV-p53, combined with chemotherapy, could increase the efficacy of PST as measured by pathologic complete response. METHODS.: In a prospective, open-label, Phase II trial, 13 patients with LABC were treated with 6 3-week cycles of PST, which consisted of intratumoral injections of Ad5CMV-p53 for 2 consecutive days plus docetaxel and doxorubicin followed by surgery. p53 status was determined at baseline and was assessed immediately after the first injection (up to 48 hours). Clinical response was assessed by clinical and radiologic methods. RESULTS.: The trial was terminated early, because none of the patients achieved a pathologic complete response. The median age was 56 years (range, 39-71 years), and the median tumor size was 8 cm (range, 5-11 cm). Eight patients (73%) had a p53 mutation. Serial biopsies showed an increase in p53 messenger RNA (mRNA) and p21(WAF1/Cip1) mRNA. All 12 evaluable patients achieved an objective clinical response. The surgical specimens revealed scattered tumor cells with extensive tumor-infiltrate leukocytes (predominantly T-lymphocytes). At a median follow-up of 37 months (range, 30-41 months), 4 patients (30%) developed systemic recurrence, and 2 patients died. The estimate breast cancer-specific survival rate at 3 years was 84% (95% confidence interval, 65.7-100%). There was no increase in systemic toxicity.

    "Title": "The Consensus Coding Sequences of Human Breast and Colorectal Cancers",
    "Abstract": "The elucidation of the human genome sequence has made it possible to identify genetic alterations in cancers in unprecedented detail. To begin a systematic analysis of such alterations, we have determined the sequence of well-annotated human protein coding genes in two common tumor types. Analysis of 13,023 genes in 11 breast and 11 colorectal cancers revealed that individual tumors accumulate an average of ~90 mutant genes but that only a subset of these contribute to the neoplastic process. Using stringent criteria to delineate this subset, we identified 189 genes (average of 11 per tumor) that were mutated at significant frequency. The vast majority of these genes were not known to be genetically altered in tumors and are predicted to affect a wide range of cellular functions, including transcription, adhesion, and invasion. These data define the genetic landscape of two human cancer types, provide new targets for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention, and open fertile avenues for basic research in tumor biology",

    "Title": "Genomic imbalances and patterns of karyotypic variability in mantle-cell lymphoma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) is genetically characterized by 11q13 chromosomal translocations involving the CCND1 gene. We have characterized five MCL cell lines, JVM-2, GRANTA-519, REC-1, JEKO-1, and NCEB-1, combining metaphase and array comparative genomic hybridization, multicolor-FISH, and molecular analysis. Our results revealed common gained regions at 2p14, 9q31.2-qter, 11q13.1-q21, 13q14-q21.2, 13q34-qter and 18q21.1-q22.1, and losses at 1p21.2-p31.1, 2p11.2, 8p21.2-pter, 9p21.3-pter, 11q23.3-qter, 17p11.2-pter, and 17q21.2-q22.2. All cell lines except JVM-2, displayed moderate or high numerical chromosome instability. In addition, an ongoing level of chromosome rearrangements was observed in REC-1. Surprisingly, NCEB-1 carried several stable mouse chromosomes and showed expression of both human and murine bcl-2 protein. Our findings indicate that these cell lines represent three patterns of chromosome evolution in MCL and may be useful to understand the pathogenesis of this neoplasm",

    "Title": "Hyperactivation of the RAS signaling pathway in myelodysplastic syndrome with AML1/RUNX1 point mutations",
    "Abstract": "AML1/RUNX1 mutations have been reported frequently in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, especially those diagnosed with refractory anemia with excess blast (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEBt), or AML following MDS (these categories are defined as MDS/AML). Although AML1 mutations are suspected to play a pivotal role in the development of MDS/AML, acquisition of additional genetic alterations is also necessary. We analyzed gene alterations in MDS/AML patients with AML1 mutations, comparing them to alterations in those without an AML1 mutation. AML1 mutations were significantly associated with -7/7q-, whereas MDS/AML patients without AML1 mutations showed a high frequency of -5/5q- and a complex karyotype. Patients with AML1 mutations showed more mutations of their FLT3, N-RAS, PTPN11, and NF1 genes, resulting in a significantly higher mutation frequency for receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-RAS signaling pathways in AML1-mutated MDS/AML patients compared to AML1-wild-type MDS/AML patients (38% versus 6.3%, P < 0.0001). Conversely, p53 mutations were detected only in patients without AML1 mutations. Furthermore, blast cells of the AML1-mutated patients expressing surface c-KIT, and SHP-2 mutants contributed to prolonged and enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation following stem cell factor stimulation. Our results suggest that MDS/AML arising from AML1/RUNX1 mutations has a significant association with -7/7q- alteration, and frequently involves RTK-RAS signaling pathway activation",

    "Title": "Molecular characterization of early-stage bladder carcinomas by expression profiles, FGFR3 mutation status, and loss of 9q",
    "Abstract": "We used gene expression profiling, mutation analyses of FGFR3 and TP53, and LOH analyses of chromosome 9 and the TP53 region on chromosome arm 17p, to molecularly characterize 75 Ta and T1 bladder carcinomas. We identified four major cellular processes related to cell cycle, protein synthesis, immune response, and extra cellular components that contribute to the expressional heterogeneity of early-stage urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC). Activating FGFR3 mutations were found at the highest frequency in G1 tumors (80%), and showed a strong correlation with FGFR3 expression. In contrast, G3 tumors displayed mutations in less than 10% of the cases and a low level of FGFR3 expression. Even though LOH on chromosome 9 was not associated with any specific expression pattern, our data indicate that loss of chromosome 9 is associated with tumor development rather than initiation. The combined analyses suggest the existence of two types of UCC tumors, one which is characterized by FGFR3 mutation or expression, high expression of protein synthesis genes, and low expression of cell cycle genes. Furthermore, the presented data underscore FGFR3 receptor involvement in urothelial cell transformation as the presence of FGFR3 mutations has a major impact on the global gene expression profile of bladder carcinomas",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and to analyze the characteristics of p53 point mutation in esophageal intraepithelial lesions. METHODS: p53 Immunohistochemical and genetic analyses were performed on histopathologically and morphometrically diagnosed lesions. Laser capture microdissection samples were used for increased accuracy. RESULTS: Of the 70 lesions studied, 21 were high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ (HGD/CIS), 21 low-grade dysplasia (LGD), 16 reactive atypical epithelia (RAE) and 12 normal epithelia (NE).Immunohistochemical staining showed p53 protein accumulation in 86% (18/21) of HGD/CIS, 81% (17/21) of LGD, and in none of RAE and NE. p53 point mutation was detected in 71% (15/21) of HGD/CIS, 67% (14/21) of LGD, but in none of RAE and NE. Of HGD/CIS and LGD with p53 protein accumulation, similar percentages had mutations: 83% (15/18) and 82% (14/17), respectively. Of lesions with mutations, 72% (21/29) had mutations at hot spots such as codons 238, 248, 273 and 282. CONCLUSIONS: p53 Point mutation prevalent in HGD/CIS was also present in a large number of LGD. This is strong evidence that LGD is a neoplastic lesion and that p53 point mutation is deeply involved in esophageal carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Novel P53 mutations detected by FAMA in colorectal cancers",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to identify p53 gene mutations by FAMA (fluorescence-assisted mismatch analysis) in colorectal cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Analytical scanning of the p53 gene (exons 5-9) was performed in colon cancer samples from 44 consecutive patients by FAMA. FAMA is a semiautomatic scanning approach based on the chemical cleavage of the mismatch in fluorescently labeled heteroduplex DNA, obtained from the combination of a normal and a mutated allele. FAMA has already shown optimal levels of diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity in detecting gene mutations (nucleotide substitutions, insertions/deletions) both at the germline and somatic level. The peculiar feature of FAMA is its ability to detect and localize mutations, by a redundant pattern of signals due to fluorescent DNA fragments generated by chemical cleavage. Moreover, previous data have demonstrated that normal contaminating DNA from stromal cells in the sample does not affect the sensitivity of the procedure, leading to the identification of the mutation even when the ratio mutant/normal allele is 10%. RESULTS: Eighteen mutations (12 missense, one nonsense, two deletions, three nucleotide substitutions at the level of the splice-junctions) and two polymorphisms were detected by FAMA in 17 patients (39%) and then confirmed by automated sequence analysis. Six of 18 mutations (33%) were not previously reported for colon cancer samples and two of 18 lesions (11%) were identified as novel p53 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Analytical scanning of the p53 gene by FAMA in DNA from colon cancer samples provides a sensitive, accurate and specific diagnostic procedure for routine clinical application",

    "Title": "Unique substitution of CHEK2 and TP53 mutations implicated in primary prostate tumors and cancer cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Genetic defects in CHEK2 and TP53 have been implicated in prostate cancer development. However, the interaction of these two genes in prostate cancer tumorigenesis has not been investigated. We previously described 11 CHEK2 mutations in a group of 84 primary prostate tumors. In this report, we screened the same group of tumors for TP53 mutations and revealed nine somatic and two germline mutations. One germline TP53 mutation (c.408A > T/p.Gln136His) and two somatic mutations (c.1022T > G/p.Phe341Cys and c.108-109ins22/p.His37fsX13) are novel to human cancer. More interestingly, CHEK2 and TP53 mutations were observed to be mutually substituted in these tumors. Analysis of five commonly used prostate cancer cell lines revealed that four cell lines harboring TP53 mutations carry no CHEK2 mutation while the only cell line (LNCaP) carrying wild-type TP53 harbors a CHEK2 mutation. The novel CHEK2 mutation (c.1160C>T/p.Thr387Asn) identified in LNCaP cells changes amino acid Thr387 to Asn which has been shown to impair CHEK2 autophosphorylation and activation. Our data suggest that the CHEK2 and TP53 mutations can substitute each other in at least 25% (21/84) of prostate cancers and that DNA damage-signaling pathway plays an important role in prostate cancer tumorigenesis",

    "Title": "The carcinogenic role of oncogenic HPV and p53 gene mutation in cervical adenocarcinomas",
    "Abstract": "Thirty tumors were collected from our archive of cervical adenocarcinomas. They were examined with respect to the content of oncogenic HPV and presence of mutations in the p53 gene exons 5 through 8. Furthermore, available clinical information on the cases was reviewed. For the detection of p53 gene and presence of oncogenic HPV, PCR followed by direct sequence analysis of the amplified DNA was employed. Seventeen tumors were identified as HPV-positive, comprising both HPV types 18 and 16. Six cases showed a p53 gene mutation, of which five were of the missence and one of the silent type. No statistical correlation between the occurrence of oncogenic HPV and presence of p53 gene mutation (p = 0.67) was recorded. Among the tumors with p53 gene mutation, three were HPV-positive and three were HPV-negative. The determination of p53 gene mutations was not related to clinical findings such as the stage of the tumor or presence of metastases of the lymph nodes. However, p53 gene mutations were somewhat more prevalent in low differentiated tumors (p < 0.02). The results indicate that oncogenic HPV and p53 gene mutations have independent carcinogenic roles in cervical adenocarcinomas",

    "Title": "Molecular genetic alterations of FHIT and p53 genes in benign and malignant thyroid gland lesions",
    "Abstract": "Several oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes are involved either as early or late event in thyroid gland carcinogenesis. Human FHIT (fragile histidine triad) gene is highly conserved gene whose loss of function may be important in the development and/or progression of various types of cancer. We undertook this study to analyze FHIT and p53 gene status in different benignant and malignant thyroid tumors. Status of these genes as well as intensity of apoptosis was analyzed in tumor tissues by molecular genetic methods, immunohistochemistry, and FACS-scan analysis. The majority of the malignant thyroid cancers displayed aberrant expression of FHIT gene, concominant with p53 gene inactivation. This is followed by low rate of apoptosis, which may be important in the development and/or progression of thyroid cancer. We found higher incidence of p53 mutation and aberrant processing of FHIT mRNA in malignant tumors (papillary, follicular, medullary and anaplastic carcinomas) and in those tumors with distant metastasis. The growth of p53(-)/FHIT(-) follicular carcinoma of human origin was much faster in nude mice than p53(+)/FHIT(+) follicular carcinoma, and mice had shorter survival rate. Our results show a correlation between aberrant FHIT and p53 expression, low rate of apoptosis, and malignancy. Concomitant aberration of FHIT gene and p53 could be responsible for development of highly malignant types of thyroid cancer and may be considered as a prognostic marker for these tumors",

    "Title": "Distribution of p53 mutations in esophageal and gastric carcinomas and the relationship with p53 expression",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of p53, a tumor suppressor gene, are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of neoplasms. This study investigated the distribution of p53 mutations within both esophageal and gastric adenocarcinomas. The correlation between p53 mutations and an overexpression of p53, which has been reported by other researchers, was also explored. Samples were taken from 17 patients following a surgical resection of the tumor. The patients included 8 cases of adenocarcinoma from the cardia (esophagogastric junction) and 9 cases of gastric carcinoma. Two or three samples were taken from each tumor, plus samples of normal tissue from the patient. Denaturing high pressure liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was employed to detect p53 mutations, and samples found to have mutations were then sequenced. The expression of p53 was determined by immunohistochemistry. DHPLC demonstrated that 37.5% (3/8) of esophageal carcinomas and 44.4% (4/9) of gastric carcinomas have p53 mutations. DNA sequencing showed the same mutation to be present in all of the samples from each tumor, while the corresponding normal tissue was free from mutations (except for 2 cases of polymorphism). The results of immunohistochemistry did not demonstrate a relationship between p53 mutations and the expression of p53 protein, and only 4 of the 7 tumors with p53 mutations showed a positive result. These findings support the hypothesis that p53 mutations are homogeneous throughout a tumor and may thus be a more useful diagnostic and prognostic indicator than the expression of p53, which does not reliably correlate with p53 mutations",

In situ hybridization study with EBER-1 probe revealed that 85% of NKTCL cases were EBV positive, but none of B-cell type was EBV positive. Frequency of mutations in p53, K-ras, c-kit, beta-catenin, and bak gene was 62.9%, 0%, 11.1%, 18.5%, and 25.9%, respectively, in NKTCL, and 71.4%, 0%, 23.1%, 21.4%, and 57.1%, respectively, in B-cell cases, showing that mutation frequency in all genes was higher in B-cell than in NKTCL cases. These findings suggest that gene mutations might be the driving-force for B-cell lymphoma, whereas combined EBV infection and gene mutations contribute to NKTCL development in Indonesia",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Carcinosarcoma of the colon is a rare histopathological entity with uncertain histogenesis, that shows both epithelial and mesenchymal malignant differentiation. Carcinosarcoma rarely affects the gastrointestinal tract and only few cases are reported in the colon. Herein we describe a carcinosarcoma of the ascending colon, with morphological, ultrastructural and molecular analysis. CASE PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old man was hospitalised for asthenia, weight loss and iron-deficiency anaemia. The patient underwent colonoscopy and adenocarcinoma was diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy. A right hemicolectomy was performed and, during surgical operation, liver metastases were detected. Histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed areas of both carcinomatous and sarcomatous differentiation, completely separated by fibrous septae. The sarcomatous component exhibited areas of smooth muscle and osteoblastic differentiation, with focal osteoid material deposition. Molecular analysis conducted separately on the epithelial and mesenchymal components revealed the same p53 gene mutation (R282W in exon 8) and identical polymorphisms in p53 exon 4, in EGFR exons 20 and 21, and in c-kit exon 17. Microsatellite markers analysis revealed a common loss of heterozygosis on 18q. Overall, the data are consistent with a common origin of the two tumor components. The patient was treated with 8 cycles of oral capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice a day for 14 days repeated every 28 days) and two years after surgery is alive with liver metastases. CONCLUSION: Carcinosarcoma of the colon is a rare tumour with both epithelial and sarcomatous components. Molecular analysis of the current case suggests the histogenesis from a common cell progenitor",

We examined TP53 status in relation to telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM) in 108 patients with glioblastoma multiforme and two patients with anaplastic astrocytoma from New Zealand and United Kingdom. Tumor samples were analyzed with respect to telomerase activity, telomere length, and ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies to determine their TMM. TP53 mutation was analyzed by direct sequencing of coding exons 2 to 11. We found an association between TP53 mutation and ALT mechanism and between wild-type TP53 and telomerase and absence of a known TMM (P < 0.0001). We suggest that TP53 deficiency plays a permissive role in the activation of ALT",

    "Title": "Quantitative Detection of p53 Mutations in Plasma DNA from Tobacco Smokers",
    "Abstract": "In lung tumors, the p53 tumor suppressor gene is commonly mutated with a characteristic mutation spectrum. The amount of and alterations in plasma DNA, such as mutations in p53, were associated with several cancers. Few studies used quantitative methods of high sensitivity. Previously, we observed p53 mutations in the noncancerous tissue that differed from those in lung tumors using the highly sensitive p53 mutation load assay. Based on our observation of an increased p53 mutation load in nontumorous lung tissue in smokers, we hypothesized that plasma DNA may contain mutant p53 indicative of tobacco smoke exposure and will be an effective biomarker of lung cancer or smoking exposure. We modified the p53 mutation load assay to detect mutations at p53 codons 248 and 249, common mutations in lung cancer, in plasma DNA samples with a sensitivity of 1:5,000. The assay was applied to a set of lung cancer cases (n = 39), hospital controls (n = 21), and population controls (n = 20) from a larger study. Controls were selected to consist of equal numbers of both ever and never smokers. The p53 mutation load (mutated p53 copies per total number of p53 copies) was associated with smoking (P = 0.06), but not with lung cancer (P = 0.59). Most of the individuals with p53 mutations observed in plasma DNA were ever smokers and the p53 mutation load was higher in those who smoked for longer durations (P = 0.04). In summary, we were able to detect p53 mutations in plasma DNA from healthy individuals and our data suggest that p53 mutations in plasma DNA may be a marker of carcinogen exposure from tobacco smoke.

    "Title": "KRAS, p53 and BRAF gene mutations and aneuploidy in sporadic colorectal cancer progression",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The origin and mechanisms of chromosomal instability are still widely unknown. We previously investigated a limited number of human sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs) and observed a statistically different occurrence of KRAS and p53 mutations among predetermined subgroups of tumors with different degrees of DNA aneuploidy. The aim of the present study was to further verify these observations by including BRAF gene analysis and by investigating a larger series of cases subdivided into Dukes' stages A to D to reconstruct some form of chronological modulation for events during CRC progression. METHODS: KRAS, p53, BRAF mutations and flow cytometric DNA Index were evaluated by established techniques in a series of 135 human sporadic CRCs. RESULTS: p53, KRAS and BRAF mutations were found in 39%, 34%, and 4% of tumors, respectively. The frequency of p53 mutations increased from 15% for stage A to 48% for stage D and was highest in near-diploid (DI < 1.4 and DI does not equal 1) and high-aneuploid (DI > 1.6) tumors. A similar correlation between gene mutations and DI values was observed for KRAS. The simultaneous presence of KRAS and p53 mutations was observed in only 11% of cases. Moreover, the co-occurrence of p53 and KRAS mutations was only observed in near-diploid and high-aneuploid tumors. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that KRAS and p53 gene mutations, which are rarely simultaneous and are associated with specific DI aneuploid values, do not represent a synergistic evolutionary pathway but may influence mechanisms of chromosomal instability",

    "Title": "Molecular, cytogenetic, and immunophenotypic characterization of follicular lymphoma grade 3B; a separate entity or part of the spectrum of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or follicular lymphoma?",
    "Abstract": "We studied a histological homogeneous group of 29 cases with the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma (FL) grade 3B (FL3Bs). In a previous study, we subdivided this group in 3 subgroups based on (1) aberrations of the 3q27 region, (2) lack of 3q27 and t(14;18), and (3) the presence of a t(14;18). In this study, we further characterized the FL3B lymphomas that are currently part of the spectrum of FL in the WHO classification, taking into account other cytogenetical aberrations, immunohistochemistry for P53, bcl2, bcl6, and CD10, rearrangement of the proto-oncogene myc, and mutation of the tumor suppressor gene TP53. With respect to P53, bcl2, bcl6 expression, myc rearrangement, and TP53 mutation, FL3B represents a homogeneous group. CD10 expression and gain of chromosome 7, considered to be typical FL markers, were more common in the FL3B t(14;18)-positive subgroup. The lack of CD10 expression and gain of chromosome 7 in most cases in the other 2 subgroups suggest that those cases have a closer relation to diffuse large B-cell lymphomas",

    "Title": "Improved clonality analysis of multifocal bladder tumors by combination of histopathologic organ mapping, loss of heterozygosity, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and p53 analyses",
    "Abstract": "The clonality status of multifocal bladder tumors is still controversially discussed with experimental evidence for both monoclonality and field cancerization. Methodologically, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and genomic sequencing analyses are widely used in clonality analysis of malignant tumors. In the present study, we used LOH analysis and genomic sequencing in combination with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and extensive histopathologic whole-organ mapping to determine the clonal relationship of multifocal bladder cancer disease. Tissue sections (1 cm(2)) covering the entire urothelial lining were systematically dissected from 2 cystectomy specimens (cystectomy 1, no urothelial lesions, bladder infiltration by a leiomyosarcoma of the vaginal wall; cystectomy 2, multifocal pT3G3 tumors). The location of each sample was documented (bladder mapping). Urothelial cells were microdissected for LOH (chromosomes 9, 17p) and FISH analysis (CDKI2 (9p21), FACC (9q22), p53 (17p13.1), and centromeric probes for corresponding chromosome). Exons 5 to 9 of the p53 gene were sequenced in all tumor samples. No chromosomal alterations were detected in the cystectomy specimen without urothelial malignancies. The tumor-bearing bladder showed an increasing frequency of deletions with increasing malignancy of the investigated lesions. LOH analysis detected deletions only on chromosomes 9p and 17p. In contrast, FISH analysis revealed deletions of all investigated genes at chromosomes 9p, 9q, and 17p in all samples analyzed (preneoplastic and neoplastic tissue). An identical p53 mutation in codon 281 was found in all 7 analyzable tumor samples. Combination of molecular data with histopathologic bladder mapping suggested a monoclonal development of the multifocal lesions mostly via intraurothelial migration. Our data strengthen the results from recently published studies that patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma seem to have a monoclonal panurothelial disease in most cases. FISH showed a much higher sensitivity for detection of chromosomal losses than classical LOH analysis, especially in preneoplastic and small lesions. Combining 3 molecular approaches together with histopathologic organ mapping presents a valuable tool to determine the clonality status of multifocal bladder tumors",

    "Title": "Comparison of chromosomal and array-based comparative genomic hybridization for the detection of genomic imbalances in primary prostate carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In order to gain new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in prostate cancer, we performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on a series of 46 primary prostate carcinomas using a 1 Mbp whole-genome coverage platform. As chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization (cCGH) data was available for these samples, we compared the sensitivity and overall concordance of the two methodologies, and used the combined information to infer the best of three different aCGH scoring approaches. RESULTS: Our data demonstrate that the reliability of aCGH in the analysis of primary prostate carcinomas depends to some extent on the scoring approach used, with the breakpoint estimation method being the most sensitive and reliable. The pattern of copy number changes detected by aCGH was concordant with that of cCGH, but the higher resolution technique detected 2.7 times more aberrations and 15.2% more carcinomas with genomic imbalances. We additionally show that several aberrations were consistently overlooked using cCGH, such as small deletions at 5q, 6q, 12p, and 17p. The latter were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting TP53, although only one carcinoma harbored a point mutation in this gene. Strikingly, homozygous deletions at 10q23.31, encompassing the PTEN locus, were seen in 58% of the cases with 10q loss. CONCLUSION: We conclude that aCGH can significantly improve the detection of genomic aberrations in cancer cells as compared to previously established whole-genome methodologies, although contamination with normal cells may influence the sensitivity and specificity of some scoring approaches. Our work delineated recurrent copy number changes and revealed novel amplified loci and frequent homozygous deletions in primary prostate carcinomas, which may guide future work aimed at identifying the relevant target genes. In particular, biallelic loss seems to be a frequent mechanism of inactivation of the PTEN gene in prostate carcinogenesis",

    "Abstract": "Adenomyoepithelioma (AME) of the breast is an uncommon tumor characterized by biphasic proliferation of both epithelial and myoepithelial cells. In rare instances, the epithelial, the myoepithelial or both components of an AME may become malignant. Described herein is the case of a 69-year-old woman who presented with myoepithelial carcinoma of the breast in an AME. Malignancy of myoepithelial component (MEC) was evidenced by the presence of cytological atypia, high mitotic rate, necrosis and local invasion. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated strong expression of P53 and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in MEC. Laser capture microdissection technique and mutational analysis further revealed point mutation of the p53 gene (T-->G transversion at codon 270) in this population, but not in glandular epithelial cells or adjacent normal ductal epithelium. No mutations in exons 1 and 2 of the K-, H-, and N-ras genes were identified in any of the neoplastic component. To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of a mutation in the p53 gene in a malignant AME of the breast",

    "Abstract": "The prognostic significance of p53 mutation, microsattelite instability and DNA mismatch protein hMLH1 expression in suboptimally resected advanced ovarian carcinoma treated with the combination chemotherapy of paclitaxel and carboplatin was evaluated. The overall combination chemotherapy response rate and the complete remission rate were significantly higher among patients with mutant p53 tumors than those with wild-type p53 tumors (35/42 (83%) vs. 32/58 (55%); P=0.003 and 18/42 (43%) vs. 16/58 (28%); P=0.03, respectively). This tendency apparently existed in non-serous carcinoma, but not in serous carcinoma. Univariate analysis showed that the risk of death due to disease and risk of progression was significantly lower among patients with p53 mutation (P=0.0357 and 0.0281, respectively). However, the presence of microsattelite instability or loss of hMLH1 expression was not associated with either the clinical response or prognosis. Determining p53 mutational status can be useful in predicting therapeutic response to drugs in ovarian carcinoma, especially in non-serous tumors",

    "Abstract": "In search of potential prognostic markers, we analyzed a large series of tissues of Barrett's esophagus and samples of adenocarcinomas arising in the terrain of Barrett's esophagus for TP53 gene mutations by direct sequencing of exons 5 to 9 of the TP53 gene. While 9 of 21 adenocarcinomas tested (42.9%) contained a TP53 mutation, none of 24 samples from Barrett's esophagus were mutated. This observation suggests that TP53 gene mutation may be a relatively late event in the progression from nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus to adenocarcinoma of esophagus. Therefore, TP53 gene mutations alone are not likely to represent a widely useful prognostic marker of the risk of progression to malignancy, at least not in Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia",

    "Abstract": "Undifferentiated (embryonal) sarcoma of the liver (USL) is a rare hepatic tumor in children. Its pathogenesis is largely unknown, but lines of evidence suggest common links to that of mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver (MH). Previously, we found a p53 mutation in a case of pediatric USL. Recently, there was another published report, demonstrating further evidence of p53 alterations in the adult cases. In this study, we analyzed in three cases of pediatric USL and two cases of MH by using PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing technique. The study identified missense mutations in all three cases of USL, but none of MH. The mutations were found specifically in tumor tissue and not detected in the surrounding normal hepatic tissue. Mutation points were localized in exon 7 (Gly245Ser), exon 6 (Arg196Pro), and exon 8 (Arg273Pro), respectively. Immunohistochemical study of p53 protein expression revealed strong immunoreactivity in cases of USL and negative staining in MH. In summary, this study provided a novel data suggesting that mutations of p53 in pediatric USL are not random genetic events and highly possible to be involved in its tumorigenesis",

    "Title": "Gene expression profiling of paired ovarian tumors obtained prior to and following adjuvant chemotherapy: molecular signatures of chemoresistant tumors",
    "Abstract": "Chemotherapy (CT) resistance in ovarian cancer is related to multiple factors, and assessment of these factors is necessary for the development of new drugs and therapeutic regimens. In an effort to identify such determinants, we evaluated the expression of approximately 21,000 genes using DNA microarray screening in paired tumor samples taken prior to and after CT treatment from 6 patients with predominantly advanced stage, high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer. A subset of differentially expressed genes was selected from all microarray data by initial filtering on confidence at p=0.05, followed by filtering on expression level (>or=2-fold). Using these selection criteria, we found 121 genes to be commonly up-regulated and 54 genes to be down-regulated in the post-CT tumors, compared to primary tumors. Up-regulated genes in post-CT tumors included substantial number of genes with previously known implication in mechanisms of chemoresistance (TOP2A, ETV4, ABCF2, PRDX2, COX2, COX7B, MUC1, MT3, MT2A), and tumorigenesis (SCGB2A2, S100A9, YWHAE, SFN, ATP6AP1, MGC5528, ASS, TACC3, ARHGAP4, SRA1; MGC35136, PSAP, SPTAN1, LGALS3BP, TUBA4, AMY2B, PPIA, COX1, GRB2, CTSL). Down-regulated genes in post-CT samples mostly included genes implicated in chemosensitivity (GRP, TRA1, ADPRTL1, TRF4-2), cell proliferation and cell cycle control (NGFRAP1, TPD52L1, TAX1BP1) and tumor suppression and apoptosis (SMOC2, TIMP3, AXIN1, CASP4, P53SCV). Additionally, gene clustering analysis revealed the existence of two distinct expression signatures of chemoresistant tumors, which was further confirmed by assessment of some genetic (p53 gene mutation status) and clinical parameters (CT regimens). Our data suggest that intrinsic and acquired chemoresistant phenotypes of post-CT tumors may be attributed to the combined action of different factors implicated in mechanisms of chemoresistance, tumor invasion/progression and control of cell proliferation. This type of molecular profiling could have important clinical implications in resolving chemoresistance and the development of novel treatment strategies designed to prevent its emergence",

    "Title": "Relationship between genetic alterations and prognosis in sporadic colorectal cancer",
    "Abstract": "Because chromosomal chromosomal instability (CIN) and microsatellite instability (MSI) are important genetic alterations in colorectal cancers, we classified the sporadic colorectal cancers (CRC) on the status of the CIN and MSI and explored their molecular profiles. A total of 213 colorectal tumors were collected for analysis of DNA ploidy, MSI, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), mutation of p53 (exons 5 to 9), Ki-ras (exons 1 and 2) and BRAF (V599E). Relationships between clinicopathological variables and molecular analyses were analyzed with the chi(2) test (Yates' correction). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared using log-rank test. Variables with p < 0.1 were entered into the Cox regression hazard model for multivariate analysis. High microsatellite instability (MSI-H) existed in 19 tumors (8.9%), which were more likely to be right-sided (31.6%) with poor differentiation (26.3%). Seventy-one (33.3%) tumors were diploid and 142 (66.7%) were aneuploid. Mutations in p53, Ki-ras and BRAF were found in 45.1%, 41.8% and 4.2% of tumors, respectively. Based on MSI, and CIN, 3 classes were defined: (i) High microsatellite instability MSI-H tumors: young age, high carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, right colon, poorly differentiated, mucin production, high BRAF mutation, lower allelic loss and relatively good prognosis; (ii) Microsatellite stability (MSS) diploid tumors: right colon, poorly differentiated, less infiltrative tumor, mucin production, lower allelic loss and low p53, BRAF mutation; (iii) MSS aneuploid tumors: more infiltrative invasion, greater allelic loss and high p53 mutation. According to multivariate analysis, tumor stage and p53 mutation were significantly associated with disease progression. The MSS diploid and MSS aneuploid CRCs could be subtyped with p53 mutation and had different prognostic outcome and molecular profiles. The 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with MSS-diploid, wild-type p53 tumors was 67% and significantly higher than those of patients with MSS-diploid, mutant p53 CRC (30%, p = 0.003). The same trend was found in patients with MSS-aneuploid CRC(wild p53 vs. mutant p53, 64% vs. 41%, p = 0.009). We concluded that CIN, MSI and p53 mutation status might be used as a multiple parameter profile for the prognosis of sporadic colorectal cancer",

    "Abstract": "The abrogation of the function of the 'gatekeeper of the genome', p53, is the most prevalent molecular alteration in solid human tumors. Regarding melanomas the involvement of p53 alterations is discussed controversially to date. In order to evaluate the status of p53 in detail, primary tumors and metastases of 63 sporadic cutaneous (CM) and mucosal (MuM) melanomas were examined by immunohistochemistry and sequence analysis of the entire coding region of the p53 transcript, i.e., exons 2 to 11. In addition, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and loss of allele-specific transcription (LOT) were determined. Accumulation of the p53 protein occurred in most of the CM and MuM specimens (71% and 58%, respectively). In contrast, protein stabilizing p53 mutations were observed in 14% of the CM and no mutation was found in MuM specimens. Two of the aberrations located outside the core domain. LOH was detected in 22% CM and 58% MuM, and LOT in 25% of the CM specimens. The genotype distribution at the polymorphic p53 codon 72 in melanoma patients differed significantly from control subjects. The calculation of odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) indicated an increased risk for developing cutaneous melanomas in individuals carrying the Pro-coding allele. Altogether, aberrant p53 expression appears to be a common event in both CM and MuM",

    "Abstract": "In the pathogenesis of adult T cell leukemia (ATL), an oncogenetic role of the human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) Tax protein, viral escape from the host immune system, and host genetic changes have been proposed as contributory factors. We examined the premature stop codons in tax gene as one of the mutations that may lead to escape of HTLV-I from the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in HTLV-I carriers, to test whether a putative CTL escape mutant can emerge in the early stage of ATL development and whether HTLV-I infected cells with such a mutation can proliferate subsequently. We also examined deletion of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 4 (INK4) genes and mutation of p53 gene in combination with changes in the HTLV-I genome in acute type ATL to test whether host genetic changes promoted the malignant transformation of ATL cells that carry putative CTL escape mutations. The premature stop codon in tax gene existed in many non-ATL HTLV-I carriers as a minor population but not in the commonest HTLV-I sequence of the individual. This minor population with a premature stop codon did not expand subsequently in 3 asymptomatic carriers tested. There were cases who had a mutation or deletion in HTLV-I who also have either deletion of INK4 genes or mutation in p53 gene. Our findings suggest that CTL escape mutation can occur at an early stage of ATL development, and that certain host genetic changes favor the development of the aggressive form of ATL",

    "Abstract": "Elevated aflatoxin B(1)-albumin adducts (AFB(1)-Alb) have been associated with an increased risk for HCC development. However, there are no studies in humans, correlating albumin adducts in blood with liver DNA adducts. Forty frozen tumor tissues and 39 paired plasma samples from HCC patients were collected in Taiwan, to determine the relationship between albumin adducts in blood and DNA adducts in liver tissue as well as mutations in p53 and methylation of p16. AFB(1)- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-DNA adducts in tissue and albumin adducts in plasma were determined by immunohistochemistry and competitive ELISA, respectively. Plasma AFB(1)-Alb adducts in subjects with low, medium and high levels of AFB(1)-DNA adducts in tumor tissues were 51.0 +/- 36.5, 70.5 +/- 48.1 and 84.9 +/- 48.2 fmol/mg, respectively (p(trend) = 0.05). No significant correlation was found for PAH. Fourteen of 40 (36%) tissues were positive for mutant p53 protein by immunohistochemistry; 11 of 40 tissue DNA samples (28%) were positive for p53 mutations, but not their corresponding plasma DNAs. p16 was methylated in 24 of 40 (62%) tissues and 12 of 39 (32%) plasma DNAs. Significant correlations were observed between AFB(1)-Alb adducts and p53 mutations and p16 methylation. These data suggest that genetic, epigenetic and environmental exposure biomarkers in plasma may help in estimating the risk for the development of HCC",

    "Abstract": "The question of whether squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) arising in different sites of lung are caused by different etiological factors is of obvious importance for prevention, early detection and effective treatment. We here subclassified a large series of resected SCCs (74 cases) into 3 tumor-sites, central (main to segmental bronchi), intermediate (subsegmental to sub-subsegmental) and peripheral (distal to sub-subsegmental bronchi), and examined relationships with p53 mutational spectra and smoking history to provide clues to etiological factors. The rate for G-->A transitions at CpG sites considered to be caused by endogenous mechanism was higher in central (40%) than in intermediate (0%) and peripheral (14%) lesions, in spite of highest percentage of heavy smokers. In contrast, G-->T transversions associated with tobacco smoke carcinogens were most frequent (50%) in the intermediate location, although proportions of heavy smoker's ratio were the same among the locations when confined to p53 mutation cases. In the periphery, other mutations were highest (67%) compared with 33 and 50% in the central and intermediate regions, respectively. Thus, different etiological factors may be playing causal roles in the development of SCCs in different locations of bronchial tree. Furthermore, the results suggest that more extensive study of the influence of tobacco smoke carcinogens on endogenous mechanisms is warranted",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In undifferentiated-type gastric carcinoma (UGC), inactivation of TP53 is infrequent at early stages and comparable to tubular adenocarcinomas (TUBs) at advanced stages. To clarify how TP53 inactivation relates to histogenesis of UGCs, we examined p53 alterations in multiple samples of individual UGCs. METHODS: We used 27 UGCs including 12 mixed types with minor tubular component (TC) and 16 with a layered structure (LS), a histological remnant of incipient signet ring cell carcinoma (SIG). We examined p53 expression immunohistochemically and analyzed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) with four microsatellite markers within 17p13.1 in multiple microdissected samples. DNA sequence of mutation hot spots in TP53 was determined in representative samples of each tumor. RESULTS: In the mixed-type UGCs, 5 and 1 of the 8 tumors without LS showed global and regional loss of wild-type TP53, respectively, through mutation and LOH, and one fourth of the tumors with LS showed the regional loss. In the tumors with the mutation, the mutation pattern was identical between TC and poorly differentiated major component. CONCLUSION: The inactivation of wild-type TP53 is an earlier event before dedifferentiation of TUB to mixed-type UGC, but is less frequent and a later event in a subset of mixed-type UGC deriving from SIG.",

    "Abstract": "The TP53 gene mutational spectrum in human tumours shows variations related to tissue of origin, carcinogen exposure or molecular background. We have compared TP53 mutations in ovarian carcinomas from different geographical regions; this study was based on data extracted and verified from the IARC database (R10, 2005), and on our results from 127 carcinomas. In total 873 mutations were evaluated. Tumours from Japan and Korea had a higher frequency of exon 7 mutations (38%vs 25%, p = 0.011) and lower frequency of exon 8 mutations (11%vs 29%, p = 0.0003) than those from Western countries; they were particularly different from Norwegian tumours which showed the lowest proportion of exon 7 (19%, p = 0.001) and highest proportion of exon 8 (37%, p < 0.0001) mutations. There were also differences in the profile of TP53 hotspots. The third hotspot in tumours from Poland was amino acid (AA) 176 (8.2% of substitutions vs 1.7% in other countries, p < 0.001), while in tumours from the UK it was AA 220 (8.9%vs 2.3%, p < 0.001). Codon 273 was the only apparent hotspot in the Norwegian tumours, while it was rarely mutated in Polish and Asian tumours. In contrast to other data tumours from Norway presented with 273(HIS) codon (82% of mutations at AA 273, p = 0.002), while tumours from the UK shared the 273(CYS) codon (80%, p < 0.001). Further analysis of TP53 gene mutations in ovarian cancer by geography could provide greater insights",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aberrant activation of beta-catenin contributes to the onset of a variety of tumours. There are many tumours that display beta-catenin accumulation in the absence of mutations in its gene. Recently, abnormal accumulation of wild-type beta-catenin has been associated with mutational inactivation of the p53 tumour suppressor. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential role of p53 and its homologue p63 in beta-catenin deregulation and to correlate this with disease outcome. METHODS: We analysed a panel of 24 samples of mycosis fungoides (MF), the most frequent manifestation of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), for beta-catenin, p53 and p63 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Based on the immunostaining results for beta-catenin protein, 11 positive cases were selected for laser microdissection, genomic DNA isolation and subsequent mutation analysis of beta-catenin exon 3 and p53 exons 4-8. RESULTS: Our findings revealed overexpression of beta-catenin, p53 and p63 in 46%, 38% and 17% of cases, respectively. The number of p53-positive cases of MF was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the beta-catenin-positive group (73%). Sequence analysis demonstrated that wild-type beta-catenin accumulation in MF is not associated with mutational inactivation of the p53 gene and, more importantly, our data provide evidence that a common polymorphic form of p53 (Arg72Pro) is significantly associated with beta-catenin overexpression (P < 0.05). No significant differences in the three genotypes were observed between the CTCL cases and the control group, demonstrating that Arg72Pro polymorphism of the p53 gene is not associated with the risk of developing cutaneous lymphomas (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We found an association of beta-catenin and p53 overexpression without detection of structural alteration in the genes, suggesting that p53 mutation is not an important mechanism for beta-catenin activation in primary CTCL. Additionally, we speculate that the p53 codon 72 polymorphism may influence negative feedback control involving beta-catenin and p53",

    "Title": "p53 Gene mutations in sporadic colorectal carcinoma in Guangxi region",
    "Abstract": "To explore the spectrum of p53 gene mutations of sporadic colorectal carcinoma in Guangxi, a Zhuang autonomous region in southern China, we examined exons 2 approximately 11 and exon-intron junctions of p53 gene from 48 patients with sporadic colorectal carcinoma by using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA direct sequencing. As a result, p53 gene mutations were found in 31.25 percent (15/48) of our patients. A total of 13 types of p53 gene mutations were found, namely, c.370T > G, c.524G > A, c.528C > G, c.529_546del18, c.536A > G, c.736A > G, c.743G > A, c.770_771del2, c.772G > T, c.814G > A, c.949delC, c.782+1G > A, and c.919+1G > C. Only a double heterozygote for c.370T > G and c.529_546del18 was found. All the other mutations were heterozygous. No homozygote was found. 524G > A was the most common mutation, accounting for 18.75 percent (3/16). c.370T > G could not be found in the whole somatic mutation section of IARC TP 53 mutation database (2004 version). c.528C > G, c.949delC, c.782+1G > A, and c.919+1G > C could not be found in colorectal carcinomas reported in the somatic mutation section of IARC TP 53 mutation database (2004 version). The frequency (45.83 percent) of p53 gene mutations in > or = 60 years old patients was higher than that (16.67 percent) in < 60 year old patients (P < 0.05). The frequency (47.83 percent) of p53 gene mutations in rectal carcinoma was higher than that (16 percent) in colonic carcinoma (P < 0.025)",

    "Abstract": "Most esophageal carcinosarcomas are diagnosed as so-called carcinosarcoma, in which individual elements may be derived from a single common ancestor cell, and there have been a few reports describing true carcinosarcoma originating from two individual stem cells. We describe a case of esophageal carcinosarcoma exhibiting neoplastic osteoid formation. Immunoreactivity for vimentin and p53 was limited to only the sarcomatous component and was absent in the carcinomatous component. Furthermore, a point mutation in exon 7 of the p53 gene was observed only in the sarcomatous component. Both sarcoma and carcinoma cells distinctively metastasized to different lymph nodes. These observations led us to diagnose the esophageal tumor as a true carcinosarcoma",

    "Title": "P53 mutations in tissue from Danish ovarian cancer patients: from the Danish 'MALOVA' ovarian cancer study",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The p53 gene, a tumor suppressor gene located on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p13), has been found mutated in 30-80% of epithelial ovarian cancers (OC), with the most frequently detected mutations in the conserved regions of the gene. A small number of studies investigated the survival of patients with p53 mutations in OC, but their conclusions are not in agreement. METHODS: We analyzed the frequency of p53 mutations in 124 Danish women with OC, using Single-Stranded Conformation Polymorphism analysis in addition with DNA sequencing and evaluated if mutations correlated with clinicopathological parameters and with patient survival. RESULTS: Thirty-five (28%) ovarian tumors were found to contain one or more p53 variations, two of which were considered polymorphisms. Twenty-seven (82%) mutations were single nucleotide substitutions of which 23 (85%) were missense mutations and therefore led to amino acid substitutions. Significantly shorter survival was found for stage III/IV patients with a p53 missense mutation compared to stage III/IV OC patients with wild type p53 (P = 0.0018). Multivariate Cox regression analysis restricted to 107 OC patients with a p53 missense mutation or p53 wild type in the tumor tissue and with information on radicality of primary surgery showed that missense p53 mutation (HR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.21-4.98), radicality after primary surgery (HR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.04-2.88), tetranectin (mg/l: HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.91) and stage (I vs. III: HR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.10-0.92, II vs. III: HR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.05-1.05, IV vs. III: HR = 2.70, 95% CI: 1.22-5.98) were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: Missense mutations in the conserved regions of p53 may be of prognostic value in Danish OC patients",

    "Title": "TP53 overexpression in recurrent endometrial carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study alterations within the p53 pathway in relation to the development of recurrent stage I endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue of both primary and recurrent tumors from 44 patients with and 44 without recurrence was used for immunohistochemical analysis of TP53, hMdm2, P21(Waf1/Cip1) and M30. DNA was extracted, and mutation analysis of p53 (exon 5-8, 11) was performed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: TP53 overexpression was significantly associated with recurrent disease: Odds Ratio 3.8 (95% CI: 1.5-9.8). Overexpression of TP53 was associated with lower staining indices (SI:0-9) of both hMdm2 and P21 in tumors of patients with recurrence, compared to controls: 2.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 4.0 +/- 0.8 and 1.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.8, respectively. Eight p53 missense mutations were identified in six patients with recurrence and two controls. One nonsense mutation was found in a patient with recurrence and one deletion in a control patient. Only a minority of TP53 overexpression cases could be explained by the presence of these p53 mutations. CONCLUSION: TP53 overexpression was significantly predictive for recurrent endometrial carcinoma, and mostly not correlated with p53 mutations. Concomitant low hMdm2 and P21(Waf1/Cip1) expression in tumors with overexpressed TP53 suggests a dysfunctional TP53-P21(Waf1/Cip1) pathway",

    "Title": "Mutational analysis of TP53 and p21 in familial and sporadic ovarian cancer in Japan",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether somatic mutations in cell cycle checkpoint genes, TP53 and p21, are involved in the development of ovarian cancer with or without BRCA1 germline mutation. METHODS: We analyzed somatic genetic alterations of TP53 and p21 in 46 ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 germline mutations and 93 sporadic patients, using direct sequencing for the entire coding sequences in TP53 and p21. RESULTS: TP53 somatic mutations were detected in 25 of the 46 BRCA1 cases and 40 of the 93 sporadic cases (54.3% vs. 43.0%). In contrast, p21 somatic mutations were detected in 1 of the 46 BRCA1 cases and 2 of the 93 sporadic cases (2.2% vs. 2.2%). TP53 mutations in sporadic cases more frequently occurred in exons 6-11 than those in cases with germline BRCA1 mutations (84.4% vs. 56.3%: P = 0.013). The proportion of sporadic cases with TP53 mutations in non-serous tumors (e.g. endometrioid, clear cell, or mucinous) was significantly lower than that in serous tumors (18.5% vs. 53.0%: P = 0.0038). However, there was no significant difference between the proportion of BRCA1 cases with TP53 mutation in non-serous and in serous tumors (37.5% vs. 57.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that somatic mutation of TP53 plays less of a role in the carcinogenesis of sporadic non-serous tumors than in that of sporadic serous tumors or BRCA1-related tumors. Furthermore, p21 somatic mutation appears to be less involved in the development of ovarian cancer than TP53 somatic mutation",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines are difficult to generate; only nine lines have been described so far and few of them have been thoroughly characterized. DESIGN AND METHODS: We established MAVER-1, a new MCL cell line, obtained from a leukemic MCL harboring both a t(11;14) translocation and a MYC rearrangement, and used immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, molecular biology and cytogenetic techniques in order to characterize the cell line precisely. RESULTS: By immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry MAVER-1 displayed a classical MCL phenotype (IgM+, l+, CD5+, CD10-, CD19+, CD20+, CD23-, CD79a+, cyclin D1+) and genetic analysis showed a typical V/D/J rearrangement with naive mutational status. According to both classic cytogenetic analysis and spectral karyotyping, MAVER-1 harbored the t(11;14) translocation associated with a complex karyotype. Molecular analysis by polymerase chain reactions showed that the t(11;14) breakpoint is within the major translocation cluster. Other important abnormalities of MAVER-1 include TP53 gene inactivation by a combined mutation of exon 8 and chromosome 17p13 deletion, ATM deletion, 8q24 (MYC) rearrangement and 8p22 deletion. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The new cell line will be useful for in vitro studies regarding MCL pathogenesis and drug sensitivity, as well as a diagnostic control material",

    "Title": "Promoter hypermethylation of the DNA-repair gene O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase and p53 mutation in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "The gene for the DNA-repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which is closely related with cellular sensitivity to alkylating agents, is inactivated by promoter hypermethylation in several human cancers, including malignant lymphoma. Promoter hypermethylation of the MGMT gene is a favorable prognostic factor in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Although inactivation of the MGMT gene is closely related to p53 gene mutations in several cancers, the relationship between p53 gene mutation and MGMT inactivation in malignant lymphoma has not been thoroughly examined. We studied the correlation between MGMT hypermethylation and p53 mutation in DLBCL and their impacts on patient prognosis. In a retrospective cohort study, we used a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction technique to analyze the methylation status of the promoter region of the MGMT gene in 116 DLBCL patients who received cyclophosphamide as part of multidrug combination chemotherapies. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing were used to search for p53 gene mutations in exons 5 through 9 in 96 of the 116 samples. Disease-free survival and overall survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate survival analyses were performed with the Cox proportional hazards model. Forty-five (38.8%) of 116 DLBCL patients showed MGMT promoter hypermethylation. The presence of MGMT hypermethylation was associated with better overall survival (P = .036). MGMT promoter hypermethylation was a prognostic factor that was independent of established prognostic factors, such as age, disease stage, serum lactic dehydrogenase level, and the number of extranodal disease sites (hazard ratio, 2.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-4.61; P = .007). p53 mutations were detected in 19 (19.8%) of 96 patients and were identified as a risk factor in the complete remission rate and overall survival (P = .0040, and P = .027, respectively). A correlation between MGMT hypermethylation and p53 mutation or p53 G:C-to-A:T mutation was not observed (P = .88, and P = .31, respectively). MGMT promoter hypermethylation and p53 mutation are useful prognostic markers in DLBCL. The impact of MGMT inactivation on p53 mutation in DLBCL is unclear",

    "Title": "Inhibition of HIV-1 replication by RNA interference of p53 expression",
    "Abstract": "p53 expression and activation have been associated to faster human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression, most probably by inducing CD4+ T cell death but also through its cooperative effect in the control of viral gene transcription by viral regulatory proteins. Here, we show that RNA interference of p53 in HIV-1 reporter (HeLa P4-R5 MAGI) and lymphoid (SupT1) cell lines blocked HIV-1 and Tat-induced transcription from the HIV-1 promoter and HIV-1 replication in acutely infected cells, suggesting a cooperative role of p53 in HIV-1 transcription. Contrary to SupT1 cells, which encode several mutations on the p53 DNA binding domain, death of HIV-1-induced syncytia was reduced in cocultures of HeLa P4-R5 MAGI with persistently infected HIV-1 cells. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the effect of the loss of function of p53 in HIV-1 replication, which is independent on its classical DNA binding activity. Our results suggest two independent roles for p53 in HIV-1 infection: cooperation in HIV long-terminal repeat transcription and virus-induced cell death",

    "Title": "Dysfunctional p53 deletion mutants in cell lines derived from Hodgkin's lymphoma",
    "Abstract": "Classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) is a distinct malignancy of the immune system. Despite the progress made in the understanding of the pathology of cHL, the transforming events remain to be elucidated. It has been proposed that mutations in the TP53 gene in biopsy material as well as cell lines derived from cHL are rare and therefore not notably involved in the pathogenesis of the malignant H&RS cells. Re-evaluating the expression in cHL-derived cell lines, we found that in 3/6 of these cell lines, TP53 transcripts are characterized by deletions within exon 4 (L428 cells) and nearly a complete loss of exons 10 - 11 (L1236) or exons 8 - 11 (HDLM-2), respectively. These changes were found in otherwise rarely mutated regions of TP53. Cell lines L1236 and HDLM-2 harbour fusions with alu-repeats in their TP53 mRNA 3'-ends, resulting in the carboxyterminal truncation and loss of the transcriptional activity of p53. Transcriptional inactivity was also found for p53 in L428 cells. This study characterizes mutations in TP53 transcripts within cHL cell lines with associated functional defects in the resulting p53 proteins and therefore reintroduces the concept that mutations of TP53 might be involved in the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's lymphoma",

    "Abstract": "It has been hypothesized that defects in DNA-mismatch repair are associated with smoking in certain types of transformed non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). We have analyzed biopsy samples from two indolent B-cell lymphomas, follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic leukemia (CLL/SLL), that have transformed to diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We correlated the presence or absence of DNA-mismatch repair enzymes by immunostaining as well as the p53 status to smoking history. Of all patients (n = 30), 37% showed negative immunostaining of MLH1, 16% showed negative immunostaining of MSH2 and 63% had p53 mutations and/or protein expression. Eighteen out of 20 transformed follicular lymphomas and seven out of 10 CLL/SLL that have transformed to DLBCL (Richter's syndrome) were informative for smoking histories. We found that the relative risk of negative immunostaining for either MLH1 or MSH2 was 2.2 times higher in smokers than non-smokers (relative risk = 2.2041, 95% confidence interval: 0.89714, 5.41491). No direct correlation was found between smoking and the mutations in the p53 gene. These results suggest that cigarette smoking may play a role in the development of transformed lymphomas through defective mismatch repair",

    "Abstract": "Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) are uncommon primary non-epithelial cell tumors of the pancreas. In addition, there are inflammatory pseudotumors (IPT) that may arise in the course of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). In the English language literature, only 24 cases of IMT and nine cases of MFH in the pancreas have been reported to date. We investigated three individual spindle cell tumors of the pancreas that were identified as MFH, IMT, and IPT, respectively, using immunohistochemical and molecular analysis. Both the MFH and the IMT, but not the IPT, showed nuclear p53 expression and mutations of the p53 gene. The MFH and the IMT also had higher mitotic and Ki-67 (MIB-1) indexes than the IPT. The IPT was found to be a tumor-like case of AIP. Many IgG4-positive plasma cells, which are considered to be a feature of AIP, were found in all three tumors. It is concluded that in this series of spindle cell tumors of the pancreas, apart from immunohistochemical features, the demonstration of p53 mutations may be helpful in distinguishing true neoplastic tumors from pseudotumors such as IPTs arising in the context of AIP",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: ZBP-89 is a widely expressed Kruppel-type zinc finger transcription factor that binds to GC-rich elements and represses or activates known target genes. ZBP-89 stabilizes wild-type p53 and can induce apoptosis independently of p53. Tissues with p53 mutations are predisposed to transformation and are more resistant to chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of ZBP-89 on seven sporadic p53 mutants was investigated. It was then examined whether a cell null for p53 in comparison to one expressing mutated p53 is more sensitive or resistant to chemotherapy in the presence of increased levels of ZBP-89. RESULTS: None of the p53 mutations were stabilized by ZBP-89 except for the A161T p53 mutation, which exhibited constitutive transcriptional activity. ZBP-89 potentiated p53-mediated cell death with 10 nM staurosporine and 100 nM etoposide, but did not in the presence of the R273H p53 mutation. CONCLUSION: ZBP-89 is an important co-activator of wild-type p53 and both proteins are negatively affected by functionally inactive p53 mutants",

    "Title": "Specific TP53 mutation pattern in radiation-induced sarcomas",
    "Abstract": "The mutagenic properties of ionizing radiation are well known, but the presence of specific mutations in human radiation-induced tumours is not established. We have studied a series of 36 secondary sarcomas arising in the irradiation field of a primary tumour following radiotherapy. The allelic status and the presence of mutations of the TP53 gene were investigated. The mutation pattern was compared with data from sporadic sarcomas recorded in the IARC TP53 somatic mutations database. A high proportion (58%) of the radiation-induced sarcomas exhibited a somatic inactivating mutation for one allele of TP53, systematically associated with a loss of the other allele. The high frequency (52%) of short deletions observed in the mutation pattern of radiation-induced sarcomas may be related to the induction of DNA breaks by ionizing radiation. The lack of hyper-reactivity of CpG dinucleotides and the presence of recurrent sites of mutation at codons 135 and 237 seem also to be specific for radiation tumorigenesis",

    "Abstract": "To prospectively evaluate the prognostic significance of TP53, H-, K-, and N-Ras mutations, DNA-ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) in patients affected by locally advanced laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Eight-one patients (median follow-up was 71 months) who underwent resective surgery for primary operable locally advanced LSCC were analyzed. Tumor DNA was screened for mutational analysis by PCR/SSCP and sequencing. DNA-ploidy and SPF were performed by flow cytometric analyses. Thirty-six patients (44%) had, at least, a mutation in the TP53 gene. Of them, 22% (8/36) had double mutations and 3% (1/36) had triple mutations. In total, 46 TP53 mutations were observed. The majority (41%) of these occur in exon 5 (19/46), while the mutations in exons 6, 7, and 8 were represented in 14, 7, and 6 patients, respectively (31%, 15%, and 16%). Five LSCC patients (6%) showed a mutation in H-Ras gene. Sixty-three percent of the cases (51/81) were DNA aneuploidy, 14% of these (7/51) were multiclonal. Thirty-nine patients (48%) had an high SPF value. At Univariate analysis, the DNA aneuploidy, high SPF (>15.1%), TP53 mutations and, in particular, the mutations that occur in exons 5 and 8 were significantly related to quicker disease relapse and short OS. At Multivariate analysis, the major significant predictors for both disease relapse and death were high SPF and any TP53 mutations. While histological grade G3 was an independent factor only for relapse. In conclusions, any TP53 mutations and high SPF are important biological indicators to predict the outcome of LSCC patients",

    "Abstract": "The putative role of TP53 and p16(INK4A) tumor suppressor genes and Ras oncogenes in the development and progression of salivary gland neoplasias was studied in 28 cases of pleomorphic adenomas (PA), 4 cases of cystic adenocarcinomas, and 1 case of carcinoma ex-PA. Genetic and epigenetic alterations in the above genes were analyzed by Polymerase Chain Reaction/Single Strand Conformational Polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) and sequencing and by Methylation Specific-PCR (MS-PCR). Mutations in TP53 were found in 14% (4/28) of PAs and in 60% (3/5) of carcinomas. Mutations in H-Ras and K-Ras were identified in 4% (1/28) and 7% (2/28) of PAs, respectively. Only 20% (1/5) of carcinomas screened displayed mutations in K-Ras. p16(INK4A) promoter hypermethylation was found in 14% (4/28) of PAs and 100% (5/5) carcinomas. All genetic and epigenetic alterations were detected exclusively in the epithelial and transitional tumor components, and were absent in the mesenchymal parts. Our analysis suggests that TP53 mutations and p16(INK4A) promoter methylation, but not alterations in the H-Ras and K-Ras genes, might be involved in the malignant progression of PA into carcinoma",

    "Title": "Molecular context of the EGFR mutations: evidence for the activation of mTOR/S6K signaling",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Activating somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are present in a small subset of lung adenocarcinomas. These mutations cluster in specific regions and confer sensitivity to inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR. To further determine the genetic and molecular characteristics of tumors carrying EGFR gene mutations, we investigated the EGFR gene status in lung adenocarcinomas and evaluated its association with specific characteristics of the patients and tumors, such as mutations at KRAS and p53, EGFR and ErbB2 gene amplification, levels of EGFR and HER2 proteins, and levels of downstream effectors of EGFR, such as phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phospho-S6 proteins. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The mutational status of EGFR was determined by direct sequencing in 86 primary lung adenocarcinomas and 12 lung cancer cell lines, and was correlated with a number of variables relating to the tumor and patient. A tissue microarray containing 37 lung tumors was constructed to determine, by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, the number of copies of EGFR and ErbB2 genes and, by immunohistochemistry, the levels of EGFR, HER2, phospho-ERK, and phospho-S6 proteins. RESULTS: EGFR gene mutations were identified in 13% of the primary tumors. The type and clustering of the mutations were identical to those previously reported. Amplification of the EGFR occurred in 14% of the tumors and could arise in tumors with EGFR mutations. Interestingly, mTOR activation, as measured indirectly by augmented levels of phospho-S6 protein, was more frequent in tumors with gene alterations in either EGFR or KRAS (P = 0.00005; Fisher's exact test) than in their wild-type counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Our data agree with the accumulation of EGFR mutations in a subset of patients with lung cancer. Moreover, we report EGFR gene amplification in EGFR-mutant tumors and a positive correlation between EGFR or KRAS alterations and activation of mTOR signaling",

    "Title": "Molecular and cytogenetic subgroups of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to acquire further insights into the pathogenetic pathways of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) that may be useful for identifying new biomarkers instrumental in developing more specific treatment approaches. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cell cycle regulators and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and BRAF genes were analyzed in a series of 90 oropharyngeal SCCs of a cohort of surgically treated patients from a single institution, and the results were matched with the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) DNA and the TP53 status. RESULTS: At least four distinct groups of tumors were identified sharing a common histology but displaying different molecular/cytogenetic patterns: (a) 19% were HPV-positive SCCs whose lack of alterations of the investigated genes could explain their particular natural history, which requires less aggressive treatment; (b) 37% were HPV-negative SCCs carrying TP53 mutations, which may be more effectively treated by drugs acting through p53-independent apoptosis; (c) 34% were HPV-negative SCCs carrying wild-type TP53 and loss of 9p21 (p16INK4a and p15INK4b) and/or cyclin D1 overexpression that justify treatment with DNA-damaging drugs followed by cell cycle inhibitors; and (d) 10% were HPV-negative lacking tumor suppressor genes and cell cycle alterations. The second, third, and fourth groups also showed an increased copy number of EGFR and chromosome 7 (43%) that might justify the additional or alternative use of EGFR inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that assessing HPV, TP53, 9p21, and EGFR status may be crucial to finding more tailored and beneficial treatments for oropharyngeal SCCs",

    "Title": "The clinical value of somatic TP53 gene mutations in 1,794 patients with breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "To investigate the clinical value of somatic TP53 mutations in breast cancer, we assembled clinical and molecular data on 1,794 women with primary breast cancer with long-term follow-up and whose tumor has been screened for mutation in exons 5 to 8 of TP53 by gene sequencing. TP53 mutations were more frequent in tumors of ductal and medullar types, aggressive phenotype (high grade, large size, node positive cases, and low hormone receptor content) and in women <60 years old. TP53 mutations within exons 5 to 8 conferred an elevated risk of breast cancer-specific death of 2.27 (relative risk >10 years; P < 0.0001) compared with patients with no such mutation. The prognostic value of TP53 mutation was independent of tumor size, node status, and hormone receptor content, confirming and reconciling previous findings in smaller series. Moreover, an interaction between TP53 mutation and progesterone receptor (PR) status was revealed, TP53 mutation combined with the absence of progesterone receptor being associated with the worst prognosis. Whereas previous studies have emphasized the fact that missense mutations in the DNA-binding motifs have a worse prognosis than missense mutations outside these motifs, we show that non-missense mutations have prognostic value similar to missense mutations in DNA-binding motifs. Nonetheless, specific missense mutants (codon 179 and R248W) seem to be associated with an even worse prognosis. These results, obtained on the largest series analyzed thus far, show that TP53 mutations identified by gene sequencing have an independent prognostic value in breast cancer and could have potential uses in clinical practice",

Frequent sites of mutation in both genes (exons 5-8 of p53 and exons 19-21 of RB2/p130) were examined. Thirty-six NPC blood samples and three NPC cell lines were investigated for the presence of mutations. No mutation of p53 and RB2/p130 genes was identified in any of the blood samples. Nonetheless, there was an identical G-->4 C nucleotide change at codon 280 of p53 gene in all the cell lines.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular basis underlying response to radiotherapy in breast cancer tissue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tumour biopsies were sampled before radiation and after 10 treatments (of 2 Gray (Gy) each) from 19 patients with breast cancer receiving radiation therapy. Gene expression microarray analyses were performed to identify in vivo radiation-responsive genes in tumours from patients diagnosed with breast cancer. The mutation status of the TP53 gene was determined by using direct sequencing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Several genes involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair were found to be significantly induced by radiation treatment. Mutations were found in the TP53 gene in 39% of the tumours and the gene expression profiles observed seemed to be influenced by the TP53 mutation status",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation for nonresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer was abandoned in 1994 on account of high recurrence rates. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the genetic detection of micrometastases in histologically negative lymph nodes of the primary colon cancer could be applied to select patients for liver transplantation. METHODS: We analyzed 21 patients with colorectal cancer who had undergone liver transplantation between 1983 and 1994 for liver metastases. Eleven patients were histologically lymph node negative at the time of surgery; ten patients with lymph node metastases served as control group. DNA sequencing was used to screen tumor material for p53 and K-ras mutations. Mutant allele-specific amplification (MASA) was then used to search for micrometastases in DNA from regional lymph nodes of the primary colorectal cancer. RESULTS: p53 and K-ras mutations were detected in 12 (57%) and 3 (14%) of 21 patients in the colorectal cancer, respectively. The mutations were confirmed in the corresponding liver metastases. Of 11 patients with histologically negative lymph nodes, nine were eligible for MASA due to presence of p53 or K-ras mutation. MASA revealed six of nine patients to be genetically positive for micrometastases. Three patients were both genetically and histologically negative. These three patients showed a significantly longer overall survival (P = 0.011) of 4, 5, and 20 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the genetic detection of micrometastases by MASA could be a powerful prognostic indicator for selecting patients with colorectal liver metastases who could benefit from liver transplantation",

    "Title": "Epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in lung cancer are linked to bronchioloalveolar differentiation",
    "Abstract": "In lung cancer, an association was made between drastic clinical response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and the presence of somatic mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR. In some cases, patients with partial response or disease stabilization do not always have EGFR-mutated tumors. To go further in the characterization of the EGF pathway, we screened EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA for mutations in 2 groups of White patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (45 cancers from women and 46 cancers from men). Associations between TP53 mutations, clinicopathologic parameters, and EGF pathway molecular alterations were analyzed. All mutations were exclusive and essentially found in EGFR and KRAS. We demonstrated that EGFR mutations were linked to female sex, absence of smoking, late age at diagnosis, and adenocarcinoma (ADC) with bronchioloalveolar (BAC) features. Moreover, in invasive ADC with BAC component, microdissection assays showed that mutations were retrieved in both tumor subtypes suggesting that EGFR mutations appear early in lung carcinogenesis. On the contrary, KRAS mutations correlated with smoking, younger age at diagnosis, and ADC subtype regardless of BAC differentiation. These results suggest the existence of distinct carcinogenesis pathways both leading to disruption of EGF regulation and targeted either by tobacco carcinogens or by unidentified toxic. The identification of BAC features in ADC helps clustering patients that are more likely to fit the EGFR-mutated group",

    "Title": "Combined small cell carcinoma with pulmonary blastoma and adenocarcinoma: case report and clonality analysis",
    "Abstract": "We describe a rare tumor occurring in the left pulmonary lobe of a 71-year-old Japanese man. The tumor, which was resected by left lower lobectomy, measured 65 x 50 x 50 mm. Histologic examination revealed papillary adenocarcinoma in small cell carcinoma, and chondrosarcoma. Also, the blastemal cells were located between the small cell carcinoma and the chondrosarcoma, and intermingled with both components. In blastemal cells, some glands resembled a well-differentiated fetal adenocarcinoma. The tumor was diagnosed as combined small cell carcinoma with pulmonary blastoma and papillary adenocarcinoma according to the 2004 WHO classification. Immunohistochemically, the small cell carcinoma expressed TTF-1, pancytokeratin, CD56, synaptophysin, and S100 protein, while blastemal cells expressed vimentin, desmin, smooth muscle actin, CD56, and S100 protein. To investigate whether the tumor was clonal or not, p53 gene mutation of each tumor component was analyzed by laser-captured microdissection, polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. Despite the histologic complexity, all components showed the same mutation at exon5 of the p53 gene. These results indicate that the tumor was clonal and arose from a relatively primitive cell, and that p53 mutation occurred before histologic metamorphosis or differentiation",

    "Title": "Radiation-induced cutaneous carcinoma of the head and neck: is there an early role for p53 mutations?",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying ionizing radiation-induced carcinogenesis of the skin. AIMS: To investigate the possible role of p53 in radiodermatitis and in the development of radiation-induced cutaneous carcinomas. METHODS: The study group comprised six patients affected by cutaneous carcinomas arising in radiodermatitis (one squamous cell carcinoma and five basal cell carcinomas), and seven patients presenting only chronic radiodermatitis. Skin specimens were evaluated for p53 immunohistochemical expression. Using laser-assisted microdissection, areas with different p53 immunoreactivity were separately submitted to DNA isolation and p53 gene analysis. RESULTS: In the majority of cases (9/12, 75%), p53 immunoreactivity was detected in radiation-damaged epidermis. In carcinomas p53 oncoprotein was expressed by several neoplastic cells in one case (16.7%%), or by nearly all neoplastic cells in four (66.7%). SSCP band shifts were detected in 9/25 samples (36%) microdissected from irradiated epidermis and in 3/6 (50%) carcinomas. DNA sequencing demonstrated two repeatedly found mutations: a G deletion at codon 244 and an A-->G transition at codon 205, as well as hallmarks of ultraviolet mutagenic action, including a C-->T transition occurring at a dipyrimidine site and a CC-->TT tandem double-base transition. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that irradiation induces significant p53 alterations that may be relevant in the modification of epithelial maturation processes and may be responsible for the high risk for development of carcinomas in radiodermatitis",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Spindle cell squamous carcinoma (SCSC) is a rare and peculiar biphasic malignant neoplasm that occurs mainly in the upper aerodigestive tract. It consists of sarcomatoid proliferation of pleomorphic spindle-shaped cells and squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: Here, we established a SCSC cell line from a tumour arisen in gingiva. We characterized the feature of a SCSC cell line by immunohistochemistry. To know the biological feature, we examined the cell growth, invasiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers of a SCSC cell line in comparison with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines. RESULTS: By immunohistochemical analyses, the primary tumour expressed cytokeratin and vimentin, indicating carcinosarcoma-like characters. This tumour also showed overexpression of p53 protein. Cultured SCSC cells resulted in bypass of crisis and maintenance over passage 100. The established SCSC cell line was spindle-shaped and showed identical immunohistochemical characters to those of primary tumour cells. Similar to the primary tumour, the cell line showed p53 overexpression and had p53 mutation at codon 132: AAG (lys)-->AAT (asp). The SCSC cell line grew slower than two other OSCC cell lines (MSCC-1 and HSC-2), whereas SCSC cells had remarkable invasiveness in comparison with these cell lines. Moreover, SCSC cells expressed wnt-5a and vimentin mRNA at high levels, but did not express E-cadherin mRNA. This expression pattern of the markers was similar to that of mesenchymal cells, not of epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: In the present study, we newly established a SCSC cell line with strong invasiveness. This is the first report on the establishment of SCSC cell line. The SCSC cell line can be a useful cell model for the study to know the cytodifferentiation and nature of SCSC",

    "Title": "Expression of C-terminal deleted p53 isoforms in neuroblastoma",
    "Abstract": "The tumor suppressor gene, p53, is rarely mutated in neuroblastomas (NB) at the time of diagnosis, but its dysfunction could result from a nonfunctional conformation or cytoplasmic sequestration of the wild-type p53 protein. However, p53 mutation, when it occurs, is found in NB tumors with drug resistance acquired over the course of chemotherapy. As yet, no study has been devoted to the function of the specific p53 mutants identified in NB cells. This study includes characterization and functional analysis of p53 expressed in eight cell lines: three wild-type cell lines and five cell lines harboring mutations. We identified two transcription-inactive p53 variants truncated in the C-terminus, one of which corresponded to the p53beta isoform recently identified in normal tissue by Bourdon et al. [J. C. Bourdon, K. Fernandes, F. Murray-Zmijewski, G. Liu, A. Diot, D. P. Xirodimas, M. K. Saville and D. P. Lane (2005) Genes Dev., 19, 2122-2137]. Our results show, for the first time, that the p53beta isoform is the only p53 species to be endogenously expressed in the human NB cell line SK-N-AS, suggesting that the C-terminus truncated p53 isoforms may play an important role in NB tumor development",

    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Automated capillary electrophoresis single strand conformation polymorphism (CE-SSCP), denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and direct sequencing were compared to investigate the benefits and sensitivity of each of the methods for detection of unknown TP53 mutations in human lung cancer. METHODS: Twenty previously analyzed DNA samples from lung tumors were examined under dummy laboratory codes for occurrence of mutations of the TP53 gene. RESULTS: Mutations were found in 17 samples; 15 (88%) of them were detected by DGGE, 16 (94%) by CE-SSCP and 12 (71%) by direct sequencing. One of the two mutations that remained undetected in DGGE was in fact outside the sequence area covered by DGGE screening, thus rendering DGGE and CE-SSCP equally efficient in mutation detection. Direct sequencing performed less well in finding mutations than the two other assays, as also shown previously. CONCLUSION: The study showed that CE-SSCP is a fast and highly reproducible method, which is considerably less laborious compared to DGGE, for screening of unknown TP53 mutations",

    "Title": "Differential promoter usage for insulin-like growth factor-II gene in Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatitis B virus infection",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) gene contains nine exons and four different promoters (P1-P4). Expression of the gene is elevated in the preneoplastic hepatic foci and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of experimental animals and humans. To gain insight into transcriptional regulation of the gene in HCC, we analyzed the relative usage of the P1-P4 promoters and its correlation with the clinical and pathological characteristics in Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. METHODS: P1-P4 usage levels of the gene in tumorous and matched adjacent nontumorous tissues from 23 HCC patients and 7 normal liver tissues were evaluated using a semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The mutation status of p53 gene in HCC tissues was analyzed by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: Transcripts from P1 were not detectable in 65.2% HCC tissues, and were expressed at low levels or not expressed in all nontumorous tissues compared with normals, but P2 usage levels showed no differences. P3 and P4 expression was significantly increased in most of HCC and almost all adjacent nontumorous tissues. There was a positive association of expression levels of both P3 and P4 transcripts in HCC tissues with the p53 mutation and presence of tumor embolus of portal vein, and expression of P3 were negatively related to differentiation of HCC. However, expression of both P3 and P4 was not associated with other parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of P1 activity and reactivation of P3 and P4 are important characteristics in most of Chinese HCC with HBV infection, and increased IGF-II expression from P3 and P4 may play an active role in early proliferation of precancerous liver cells and hepatocarcinogenesis of these cases. Significant increase in fetal transcripts is associated with the p53 mutation and poor prognosis of the HCC patients and might serve as one of identification parameters of poor HCC prognosis",

    "Abstract": "Clarification of TP53 alterations is important to understand the mechanisms underlying the development of diffuse astrocytomas. It has been suggested that the alleles of TP53 at codon 72 differ in their ability to induce apoptosis in human cancers. The aim of this study was to analyze the possible association of TP53 mutation, p53 overexpression, and p53 codon 72 polymorphism with susceptibility to apoptosis in adult Brazilian patients with diffuse astrocytomas. We analyzed 56 surgical specimens of diffuse astrocytomas for alterations of TP53, using polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) direct sequencing. p53 and cleaved caspase 3 protein expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry. We found TP53 mutations in 19.6% (11 out of 56) of tumors tested, with the lowest mutation rate found in the cases of glioblastomas (8.8%) (p = 0.03). Only 16.1% of tumors tested showed cleaved caspase 3-positive staining, demonstrating that apoptosis is very inhibited in these tumors. All tumors having TP53 mutation and p53 accumulation had no expression of cleaved caspase 3. Additionally, no association was observed in tumors having proline and arginine alleles and expression of cleaved caspase 3. We concluded that clarification of the TP53 alterations allows a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the progression of diffuse astrocytomas, and the allele status at codon 72 was not associated with apoptosis in these tumors",

    "Title": "Association of breast cancer outcome with status of p53 and MDM2 SNP309",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: A common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of the MDM2 gene, known as T-309G and referred to as SNP309 for this study, leads to increased expression of Mdm2 protein and attenuated function of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. We investigated whether genetic variants in MDM2 were associated with breast cancer incidence and survival and whether the variant status could interact with the tumor p53 status to modify breast cancer survival. METHODS: We used multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses to study the relationship of SNP309 status and the status of a second MDM2 SNP in exon 12 at codon 354 (SNP354) with breast cancer incidence and with disease-specific survival among 293 case patients and 317 cancer-free control subjects. Survival analysis included 248 of the 293 case patients who had known tumor p53 status. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We did not observe an association between SNP309 status and breast cancer incidence in the unstratified analysis, but we did find a statistically significant association between SNP354 status and breast cancer incidence (odds ratio = 3.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.88 to 5.93). We also discovered a statistically significant interaction between SNP309 status and tumor p53 expression for breast cancer survival (P(interaction) = .002). Among homozygous carriers of the common MDM2 SNP309 allele (T/T), a mutant p53 status (risk ratio [RR] of death = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.08 to 5.03) and aberrant p53 protein expression (RR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.22 to 5.57) in breast tumors were associated with poor survival. Tumor p53 status was not associated with breast cancer survival among carriers of the variant MDM2 SNP309 allele (G/T or G/G), which is consistent with a dominant effect of the variant allele. CONCLUSION: A strong interaction between SNP309 status and tumor p53 status appears to modify the association between p53 status and breast cancer survival",

    "Title": "Different p53 mutation patterns in colorectal tumors from smokers and nonsmokers",
    "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies consistently find associations between colorectal cancer and cigarette smoking; however, there are little molecular data supporting the association. To examine the relationship between cigarette smoking and colorectal cancer, we compared p53 mutation patterns in colorectal tumors from smokers and nonsmokers. In this study, 153 tumor tissues from colorectal cancer patients, including 63 smokers and 90 nonsmokers, were examined for p53 mutation and p53 protein expression by direct sequencing and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. p53 mutations were detected in 77 of 153 (50.3%) colorectal tumors, and no difference was observed in the p53 mutation frequencies in tumors from smokers and nonsmokers (33 of 63, 50.8% for smokers vs. 44 of 90, 48.9% for nonsmokers, P = 0.743). IHC showed that p53-immunoreactive tumors were positively correlated with p53-mutated tumors (P < 0.0001). G:C-->A:T transition and G:C-->T:A transversion were the predominant types of mutations detected in the tumor p53 genes. G:C-->A:T mutation was relatively more common in nonsmokers than in smokers (93.5% for nonsmokers vs. 77.3% for smokers), although this difference was not significant. The frequency of deletion mutation in smoker tumors, however, was significantly higher than that in nonsmoker tumors (7 of 33, 21.2% for smokers vs. 1 of 44, 2.3% for nonsmokers, P = 0.01). Although there were only a few cases of p53 deletion mutation in this study, the observation of a higher frequency of p53 deletion mutation in smoker tumors supports the association between cigarette smoking and the development of colorectal cancer",

    "Title": "Molecular parameters associated with insulinoma progression: chromosomal instability versus p53 and CK19 status",
    "Abstract": "Insulinomas represent the predominant syndromic subtype of endocrine pancreatic tumors (EPTs). Their metastatic potential cannot be predicted reliably using histopathological criteria. In the past few years, several attempts have been made to identify prognostic markers, among them TP53 mutations and immunostaining of p53 and recently cytokeratin 19 (CK19). In a previous study using conventional comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) we have shown that chromosomal instability (CIN) is associated with metastatic disease in insulinomas. It was our aim to evaluate these potential parameters in a single study. For the determination of CIN, we applied CGH to microarrays because it allows a high-resolution detection of DNA copy number changes in comparison with conventional CGH as well as the analysis of chromosomal regions close to the centromeres and telomeres, and at 1pter-->p32, 16p, 19 and 22. These regions are usually excluded from conventional CGH analysis, because they may show DNA gains in negative control hybridizations. Array CGH analysis of 30 insulinomas (15 tumors of benign, eight tumors of uncertain and seven tumors of malignant behavior) revealed that >or=20 chromosomal alterations and >or=6 telomeric losses were the best predictors of malignant progression. A subset of 22 insulinomas was further investigated for TP53 exon 5-8 gene mutations, and p53 and CK19 expression. Only one malignant tumor was shown to harbor an arginine 273 serine mutation and immunopositivity for p53. CK19 immunopositivity was detected in three malignant tumors and one tumor with uncertain behavior. In conclusion, our results indicate that CIN as well as telomeric loss are very powerful indicators for malignant progression in sporadic insulinomas. Our data do not support a critical role for p53 and CK19 as molecular parameters for this purpose",

    "Abstract": "HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common neoplasm in Egypt where genotype-4 is prevalent. In the present study the incidence and pattern of p53 mutations was assessed in relation to HCV-genotype- 4 in Egyptian HCC patients. We investigated 25 HCV positive HCCs for p53 mutations/overexpression in relation to HCV-NS3 by immunohistochemistry, SSCP and sequencing. Genotyping was done using LiPA-II and TRUGENE 5' NC' sequencing kit. Results were correlated to standard clinicopathologic prognostic factors for HCC. Thirteen cases showed p53 overexpression, and 10 showed p53 mutation (13 mutations) by sequencing (72% concordance). The highest mutation rate was in exons 6 and 7 (30%) followed by exons 5 and 8 (20%). Mutations included 3 transitions, 5 transversions, 3 deletions, and 2 insertions. All exon 7 mutations were at codon 249 specific for AFB1 (AGG-->AGT, Arg-->Ser) and codon 248 specific for vinyl chloride contamination (CGG-->TGG, Arg-->Trp). Other mutations reported are novel. Immunostaining for HCV NS3 was detected in 19 cases independent of p53 mutation. p53 aberrations were significantly associated with poor prognostic factors for HCC. However, no specific pattern for p53 mutations was observed in HCV genotype 4-associated HCC and no significant relation between p53 mutations, HCV-NS3 expressions or any HCV sub-genotype-4 sequence",

    "Abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated in breast cancer. Here, we used direct sequencing to screen the complete coding sequence of the p53 gene from 41 human breast cancer cell lines. We identified 32 cell lines (78%) with a p53 gene alteration that predicted a change in the encoded protein. Thirty-one of these mutations were accompanied by loss of the other p53 allele. All mutations but one were unique and 27 mutations had previously been identified in uncultured human cancers. Ten mutations were predicted to encode a truncated p53 protein and 22 missense mutations were identified. p53 transcript expression was analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and p53 protein expression was determined by Western blotting. Our analyses revealed three p53 expression patterns: wild-type p53 cell lines had normal transcript levels and low or no detectable protein expression; cell lines with a p53 truncating mutation had low transcript levels and low or no detectable protein expression; and cell lines with a p53 missense mutation had highly variable transcript and protein expression levels. As a whole, our data represent a p53 mutation profile in breast cancer cell lines, providing a model for structural, functional and pharmacological studies on p53 in human cancer",

    "Title": "Analysis of P53 mutations and their expression in 56 colorectal cancer cell lines",
    "Abstract": "A comprehensive analysis of the TP53 gene and its protein status was carried out on a panel of 56 colorectal cancer cell lines. This analysis was based on a combination of denaturing HPLC mutation screening of all exons of the p53 gene, sequencing the cDNA, and assessing the function of the p53 protein by assaying the induced expression of phosphorylated p53 and p21 after exposing cells to gamma-rays. In a few cases where there was no production of p53 message nor evidence of functional p53 protein, all of the p53 exons were sequenced directly. Thirteen of the 56 cell lines had functional p53, 21 lines had missense mutations (one of which made no detectable protein), 4 lines produced no p53 transcripts, and the remaining 18 lines carried truncating TP53 mutations. Thus, our results showed a relatively high frequency of TP53 mutations (76.8%) in our cell lines, with almost half of the mutations being truncating mutations. This is a rather higher frequency of such mutations than usually reported. Of the 18 cell lines with truncating mutations, 12 had detectable truncated protein based on Western blot analysis, whereas no protein was detected in the remaining 6 cell lines. Our data provide a valuable source of TP 53 mutations for further studies and raise the question of the extent to which truncating mutations may have dominant negative effects, even when no truncated protein can be detected by standard methods",

    "Title": "Mutation and genomic deletion status of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and p53 confer specific gene expression profiles in mantle cell lymphomas",
    "Abstract": "Although mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) frequently harbors inactivated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and p53 alleles, little is known about the molecular phenotypes caused by these genetic changes. We identified point mutations and genomic deletions in these genes in a series of cyclin D1-positive MCL cases and correlated genotype with gene expression profiles and overall survival. Mutated and/or deleted ATM and p53 alleles were found in 56% (40/72) and 26% (21/82) of the cases examined, respectively. Although MCL patients with inactive p53 alleles showed a significant reduction in median overall survival, aberrant ATM status did not predict for survival. Nevertheless, specific gene expression signatures indicative of the mutation and genomic deletion status of each gene were identified that were different from wild-type cases. These signatures were comprised of a select group of genes related to apoptosis, stress responses, and cell cycle regulation that are relevant to ATM or p53 function. Importantly, we found the molecular signatures are different between cases with mutations and deletions, because the latter are characterized by loss of genes colocalized in the same chromosome region of ATM or p53. This information on molecular phenotypes may provide new areas of investigation for ATM function or may be exploited by designing specific therapies for MCL cases with p53 aberrations",

    "Title": "Gene expression of ferredoxin reductase predicts outcome in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated by 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Ferredoxin reductase (FDXR) is a putative contributor to p53-mediated apoptosis from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) through the generation of oxidative stress in the mitochondria. However, the influence of FDXR gene expression levels on the outcome of 5-FU chemotherapy has been relatively little studied. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between FDXR gene expressions and the clinical outcome when treated by 5-FU chemotherapy, as well as the correlation of FDXR gene expressions and p53 mutation. METHODS: Pre-chemotherapeutic fresh frozen samples of 33 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, who received bolus 5-FU and leucovorin (LV) as first line chemotherapy, were studied. FDXR gene expression and p53 mutation were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and direct sequencing, respectively. RESULTS: FDXR gene expression was significantly higher in responding tumors compared with non-responding ones (P=0.0379). Patients with FDXR values above the cutoff value of 13.52 had a statistically longer survival than those with FDXR gene expressions below the cutoff value (P=0.0148). The 9 tumors with wild-type p53 had statistically higher FDXR gene expressions than the 14 tumors with mutant-type p53 which had sequence alterations within the 'hot spot' codons, the L2-L3 loops, or frameshift (P=0.0463). CONCLUSIONS: FDXR gene expression did not affect clinical outcome in patients with wild-type p53 tumors, whereas, among patients with p53 mutant-type tumors, patients with tumors with low FDXR gene expression had a worse outcome than those with a high FDXR gene expression (P=0.0200). FDXR gene expression, which is regulated at least in part by p53, is associated with both response and survival when metastatic colorectal cancer is treated with 5-FU plus LV. In addition, analysis of p53 mutation combined with FDXR gene expression might be useful in estimating the outcome in 5-FU-treated patients",

    "Abstract": "Mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) is genetically characterized by the translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) and a high number of secondary chromosomal abnormalities. To identify genes inactivated in this lymphoma, we examined 5 MCL cell lines following a strategy previously described in tumors with microsatellite instability that is based on the combined inhibition of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway and gene-expression profiling. This approach, together with the design of a conservative algorithm for analysis of the results, allowed the identification of 3 genes carrying premature stop codons. These genes were p53 with a mutation previously described in JEKO-1, the leukocyte-derived arginine aminopeptidase (LRAP) gene in REC-1 that showed a new splicing isoform generating a premature stop codon, and RB1 in UPN-1 that contained an intragenic homozygous deletion resulting in a truncated transcript and total loss of protein expression. The new LRAP isoform was detected also in 2 primary MCLs, whereas inactivating intragenic deletions of RB1 were found in the primary tumor from which UPN-1 was derived and 1 additional blastoid MCL. These tumors carried a concomitant inactivation of p53, whereas p16INK4a was wild type. These results indicate for the first time that RB1 may be inactivated in aggressive MCL by intragenic deletions",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene have been associated with poor survival in some series of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) but not in other studies. The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency of TP53 alterations (mutations or deletions), characterize the gene expression of mutant/deleted cases, and determine the effects of mutations on survival. In a series of DLBCL that had previous gene expression profiling, we identified 24 mutations in 113 cases (21%). There was no difference in the frequency of mutations in the molecular subgroups of DLBCL. Twelve (50%) of the 24 cases had mutations localized to the DNA-binding codons in the core domain of TP53. The presence of any TP53 mutation correlated with poor overall survival (OS; P = .044), but DNA-binding mutations were the most significant predictor of poor OS (P < .001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that the International Prognostic Index, tumor size, and TP53 DNA-binding mutations were independent predictors of OS. Gene expression analysis showed that TRAILreceptor-2 (DR5) was the most differentially underexpressed gene in the TP53 mutated cases. Investigation is warranted into targeted therapy toward TRAIL receptor-2, to potentially bypass the adverse effect of mutated TP53 in DLBCL",

    "Title": "High prevalence of p53 exon 4 mutations in soft tissue sarcoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer, including soft tissue sarcoma (STS). The authors characterized p53 alterations (protein accumulation and gene mutation) in STS to evaluate possible associations with patient outcomes. METHODS: Thirty-one STS specimens (multiple histologies) were analyzed by p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and direct DNA sequencing of p53 exons 2-11 and then correlated with outcomes. RESULTS: Direct p53 sequencing detected mutations in 10 of 31 STSs; 7 of 10 were missense mutations, whereas 3 of 10 were either insertions or frameshift mutations, leading to nonfunctional truncated p53; 7 of these p53 mutations have not been previously described. Four p53 exon 4 mutations were identified, a p53 region previously unknown to be mutation prone. Eighteen of the 31 specimens expressed p53 when the authors used the clinical IHC assay of their institution. Interassay concordance of 48% was observed; only 6 of 10 sequencing-identified p53 mutated specimens exhibited nuclear p53 protein expression by IHC, whereas 12 of 18 specimens exhibiting p53 protein expression by IHC harbored sequencing-identified wild-type p53. Decreased survival was observed in STS patients bearing sequencing-identified mutated p53 versus wild-type p53, as was a correlation between IHC-determined nuclear p53 protein expression and decreased survival. CONCLUSIONS: p53 protein stabilization and p53 mutation frequently occur in STS, and both suggest worse outcomes for patients so affected. However, increased p53 protein expression does not necessarily indicate p53 gene mutation. The high incidence of exon 4 mutations found in STS suggests that p53 sequencing should not be limited to the core DNA binding domain",

    "Title": "Low frequency of p53 and k-ras codon 12 mutations in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) tumors and surgical margins",
    "Abstract": "AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers and has became a predominant cause of cancer-related death throughout the world. The k-ras codon 12 mutation, which is the most common lung cancer mutation, is found in 15 to 30% of all lung cancers. Furthermore, the p53 gene has a very important role in the biological properties of tumor cells, and it is mutated in about 50% of non-small cell lung cancers. Residual tumor cells remain in surgical margins diagnosed as tumor free by histopathological techniques, and they can play a role in forming any local recurrence. Molecular methods may be exploited that are sensitive enough to detect small numbers of tumor cells. METHODS: In the present study, we examined p53 gene mutations and k-ras codon 12 mutations from the tumor samples and surgical margins of 34 non-small-cell lung cancer patients. P53 gene mutations were analyzed by single strand conformational polymorphism analysis, heterodublex analysis and DNA sequencing. K-ras codon 12 mutations were analyzed by the mutagenic PCR-restricted fragment length polymorphism method. RESULTS: A p53 mutation was detected only in primary tumors of 3 out of 34 patients (8.82%). These mutations were clustered in exon 5. Moreover, a k-ras codon 12 mutation was detected in both the primary tumor and the surgical margin tissues of 2 out of 34 patients (5.88%). CONCLUSIONS: The detected mutation rate was low, in the range given in the literature. We think that different mechanisms related to other genes and individual genetic differences might play a role in cancer formation in our study group. We believe that molecular studies are necessary to identify biomarkers and to determine genetic alterations in histopathologically normal surgical margins",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Our aim was to characterize the molecular and genotypic profile of eight thyroid carcinoma-derived cell lines-TPC1, FB2, B-CPAP, K1, XTC-1, C643, 8505C, and Hth74-in order to use them as in vitro models of thyroid carcinogenesis. Design: We evaluated the expression of five thyroid-specific genes (Tg, TSHr, TPO, PAX8, and TTF-1) to establish the cell lineage and to assess the differentiation status of each of the cell lines. We screened for mutations in the most relevant oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes affected in thyroid carcinogenesis: RAS, BRAF, CTNNB1, and TP53 along with RET/PTC rearrangements. Considering the putative relevance in general carcinogenesis, we have also studied other molecules such as EGFR, PI3K, RAF-1, and THRB. To determine the genetic identity of the cell lines, we performed genotypic analysis. Main outcome: The panel of cell lines we have studied displayed activation of several oncogenes (BRAF, RAS, RET/PTC) and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (TP53) known to be important for thyroid carcinogenesis. Two of the cell lines-TPC1 and FB2-shared the same genotypic profile, probably representing clones of an ancestor cell line (TPC1). Conclusion: Due to their different molecular alterations, these cell lines represent a valuable tool to study the molecular mechanisms underlying thyroid carcinogenesis. We suggest that genotypic analyses should be included as a routine procedure to guarantee the uniqueness of each cell line used in research",

    "Title": "A candidate precursor to serous carcinoma that originates in the distal fallopian tube",
    "Abstract": "The tubal fimbria is a common site of origin for early (tubal intraepithelial carcinoma or TIC) serous carcinomas in women with familial BRCA1 or 2 mutations (BRCA+). Somatic p53 tumour suppressor gene mutations in these tumours suggest a pathogenesis involving DNA damage, p53 mutation, and progressive loss of cell cycle control. We recently identified foci of strong p53 immunostaining-termed 'p53 signatures'-in benign tubal mucosa from BRCA+ women. To examine the relationship between p53 signatures and TIC, we compared location (fimbria vs ampulla), cell type (ciliated vs secretory), evidence of DNA damage, and p53 mutation status between the two entities. p53 signatures were equally common in non-neoplastic tubes from BRCA+ women and controls, but more frequently present (53%) and multifocal (67%) in fallopian tubes also containing TIC. Like prior studies of TIC, p53 signatures predominated in the fimbriae (80-100%) and targeted secretory cells (HMFG2 + /p73-), with evidence of DNA damage by co-localization of gamma-H2AX. Laser-capture microdissected and polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA revealed reproducible p53 mutations in eight of 14 fully-analysed p53 signatures and all of the 12 TICs; TICs and their associated ovarian carcinomas shared identical mutations. In one case, a contiguous p53 signature and TIC shared the same mutation. Morphological intermediates between the two, with p53 mutations and moderate proliferative activity, were also seen. This is the first report of an early and distinct alteration in non-neoplastic upper genital tract mucosa that fulfils many requirements for a precursor to pelvic serous cancer. The p53 signature and its malignant counterpart (TIC) underline the significance of the fimbria, both as a candidate site for serous carcinogenesis and as a target for future research on the early detection and prevention of this disease",

    "Abstract": "Urothelial neoplasms in patients 19 years of age or younger are rare, and the data regarding clinical outcome are conflicting. Molecular data are not available. Urothelial tumours from 14 patients aged 4 to 19 years were analysed, including FGFR3 and TP53 mutation screening, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), UroVysion FISH analysis, polymerase chain reaction for human papillomavirus (HPV), microsatellite analysis using the NIH consensus panel for detection of microsatellite instability (MSI) and six markers for loss of heterozygosity on chromosome arms 9p, 9q, and 17p and immunohistochemistry for TP53, Ki-67, CK20 and the mismatch repair proteins (MRPs) hMSH2, hMLH1, and hMSH6. Based on the 2004 WHO classification, one urothelial papilloma, seven papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential (PUNLMPs), five low-grade, and one high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma were included. No multifocal tumours were found and recurrence was seen in only one patient with a urothelial papilloma. All patients were alive with no evidence of disease at a median follow-up of 3.0 years. We found no mutations in FGFR3, deletions of chromosome arms 9p, 9q or 17p, MSI or MRP loss, or HPV positivity in any of the patients. Three cases showed chromosome alterations in CGH analyses, urothelial dedifferentiation with CK20 overexpression, or aneuploidy, and one TP53 mutation with TP53 overexpression was found. Urothelial neoplasms in people younger than 20 years are predominantly low grade and are associated with a favourable clinical outcome.

    "Title": "CD44-positive colorectal adenoma cells express the potential stem cell markers musashi antigen (msi1) and ephrin B2 receptor (EphB2)",
    "Abstract": "The majority of colorectal adenomas contain a mutation in the APC gene activating the wnt pathway. As wnt signalling preserves stem cell functions, it would be expected that stem cells would be enriched in adenomas. We have shown expression of the wnt target gene CD44, which may characterize the expanded stem cell compartment, in colorectal tumours. To investigate this possibility, we performed an immunohistological survey of CD44 expression in relation to the proliferation marker Ki67 and apoptosis in colorectal tumour tissue, and have isolated a CD44-positive subpopulation of the human colorectal adenoma cell line LT97 for cell biological analysis. In tissues, CD44 expression was not related to Ki67, but was associated with lower apoptosis in the CD44-positive areas. CD44-positive and -negative populations isolated from LT97 cultures were identical in their Ki-ras and p53 status but differed in their growth and survival characteristics. While CD44-positive cells attached and grew to reconstitute the original culture, the CD44-negative cells rapidly underwent apoptosis and were unable to resume growth. In comparison to unsorted growing LT97 cells, the CD44-positive cells had shifted beta-catenin into the nucleus and expressed beta-catenin target genes, such as ephrin B receptor (ephB2) and musashi antigen (msi1). By contrast, CD44-negative cultures contained no cells with nuclear beta-catenin. In summary, the CD44-positive cells accumulating in colorectal tumours have increased survival capacity both in vivo and in vitro. They also express markers typical of colorectal progenitor cells, msi1 and ephB2, in the premalignant progenitor population",

    "Title": "Association of p53 gene alterations with the expression of antiapoptotic survivin splice variants in breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "Survivin, a member of the inhibitory apoptosis protein family, gives rise, by an alternative splicing, to four variants with different functions. Many experimental studies indicate that p53 can regulate the expression of survivin and some of its splice variants. Although both the expression of survivin splice variants and the p53 gene were frequently altered in human cancers, nothing is known about their interactions in in vivo tumour samples. Here, we report that, in 162 breast carcinomas, p53 mutations are significantly associated with an increased expression of survivin and, in particular, its antiapoptotic splice variants (survivin-DeltaEx3 and survivin-3B). The upregulation of these variant expressions is particularly related to p53 mutations occurring in the residues belonging to the tetramerization domain. The loss of heterozygosity in the p53 gene is also associated with an increased expression of the survivin-DeltaEx3 variant. The expression of the proapoptotic variants (survivin-2B and survivin-2alpha) is not affected by any of these alterations. Our results provide for the first time in vivo evidence that, in human breast cancer, the survivin expression as well as its splicing depends on the p53 status. The results also suggest that the upregulation of antiapoptotic survivin variant expression by the mutant p53 may increase breast cancer cells survival and resistance to therapy",

    "Title": "Genomic profiling of malignant melanoma using tiling-resolution arrayCGH",
    "Abstract": "Malignant melanoma is an aggressive, heterogeneous disease where new biomarkers for diagnosis and clinical outcome are needed. We searched for chromosomal aberrations that characterize its pathogenesis using 47 different melanoma cell lines and tiling-resolution bacterial artificial chromosome-arrays for comparative genomic hybridization. Major melanoma genes, including BRAF, NRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, CTNNB1, CDK4 and PTEN, were examined for mutations. Distinct copy number alterations were detected, including loss or gain of whole chromosomes but also minute amplifications and homozygous deletions. Most common overlapping regions with losses were mapped to 9p24.3-q13, 10 and 11q14.1-qter, whereas copy number gains were most frequent on chromosomes 1q, 7, 17q and 20q. Amplifications were delineated to oncogenes such as MITF (3p14), CCND1 (11q13), MDM2 (12q15), CCNE1 (19q12) and NOTCH2 (1p12). Frequent findings of homozygous deletions on 9p21 and 10q23 confirmed the importance of CDKN2A and PTEN. Pair-wise comparisons revealed distinct sets of alterations, for example, mutually exclusive mutations in BRAF and NRAS, mutual mutations in BRAF and PTEN, concomitant chromosome 7 gain and 10 loss and concomitant chromosome 15q22.2-q26.3 gain and 20 gain. Moreover, alterations of the various melanoma genes were associated with distinct chromosomal imbalances suggestive of specific genomic programs in melanoma development",

    "Title": "Exquisite sensitivity of TP53 mutant and basal breast cancers to a dose-dense epirubicin-cyclophosphamide regimen1",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In breast cancers, only a minority of patients fully benefit from the different chemotherapy regimens currently in use. Identification of markers that could predict the response to a particular regimen would thus be critically important for patient care. In cell lines or animal models, tumor protein p53 (TP53) plays a critical role in modulating the response to genotoxic drugs. TP53 is activated in response to DNA damage and triggers either apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest, which have opposite effects on cell fate. Yet, studies linking TP53 status and chemotherapy response have so far failed to unambiguously establish this paradigm in patients. Breast cancers with a TP53 mutation were repeatedly shown to have a poor outcome, but whether this reflects poor response to treatment or greater intrinsic aggressiveness of the tumor is unknown. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study we analyzed 80 noninflammatory breast cancers treated by frontline (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. Tumor diagnoses were performed on pretreatment biopsies, and the patients then received six cycles of a dose-dense regimen of 75 mg/m(2) epirubicin and 1,200 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide, given every 14 days. After completion of chemotherapy, all patients underwent mastectomies, thus allowing for a reliable assessment of chemotherapy response. The pretreatment biopsy samples were used to determine the TP53 status through a highly efficient yeast functional assay and to perform RNA profiling. All 15 complete responses occurred among the 28 TP53-mutant tumors. Furthermore, among the TP53-mutant tumors, nine out of ten of the highly aggressive basal subtypes (defined by basal cytokeratin [KRT] immunohistochemical staining) experienced complete pathological responses, and only TP53 status and basal subtype were independent predictors of a complete response. Expression analysis identified many mutant TP53-associated genes, including CDC20, TTK, CDKN2A, and the stem cell gene PROM1, but failed to identify a transcriptional profile associated with complete responses among TP53 mutant tumors. In patients with unresponsive tumors, mutant TP53 status predicted significantly shorter overall survival. The 15 patients with responsive TP53-mutant tumors, however, had a favorable outcome, suggesting that this chemotherapy regimen can overcome the poor prognosis generally associated with mutant TP53 status. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, in noninflammatory breast cancers, TP53 status is a key predictive factor for response to this dose-dense epirubicin-cyclophosphamide regimen and further suggests that the basal subtype is exquisitely sensitive to this association. Given the well-established predictive value of complete responses for long-term survival and the poor prognosis of basal and TP53-mutant tumors treated with other regimens, this chemotherapy could be particularly suited for breast cancer patients with a mutant TP53, particularly those with basal features",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the correlation between the genotypic and phenotypic patterns of p53 in patients with transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 73 patients diagnosed with TCC. DNA was obtained from the tumor tissue to perform polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) of exons 5-9 of the p53 gene, with automatic sequencing done on any mutated samples. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was also performed using anti-human P53 monoclonal antibody, and the diagnostic performance of this test was analyzed by a ROC curve, using the presence of p53 mutations found by PCR-SSCP as 'gold standard'. RESULTS: The cutoff point for defining immunopositivity was 20%. IHC had a specificity of 62.9%, and a sensitivity of 65.8%. The highest sensitivity values appeared in G3 tumors (75%) and infiltrating tumors (71.4%), and the highest specificity values were observed in G1 (77.7%) and G2 tumors (90%) and superficial tumors (66.6%). Mutations in exon 8 gave a positive result most frequently (73.7%) and were considered most relevant in terms of altering P53 function (60.9%). False negatives were documented in 28.5% of infiltrating tumors, and false positives in 33.4% of superficial tumors. CONCLUSIONS: There is a moderate correlation between p53 mutations and P53 protein overexpression, with this stronger in high-grade, infiltrating tumors, in exon 8 mutations, and when the mutation induces relevant changes in the protein structure. Although IHC is useful in routine clinical practice, the classic prognostic factors should still be considered the most important in the follow-up of these patients",

    "Abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are sarcomas with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Factors contributing to tumor progression are largely unknown. We therefore examined MPNST from 22 neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients, 14 non-NF1 patients, and 14 neurofibroma patients for matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) expression. Because wild-type and mutant p53 were shown to differentially regulate MMP-13 expression, TP53 status and protein levels were also determined. MMP-13 expression was detected in 58% of MPNST and was significantly associated with recurrent MPNST (P = .019). p53 was observed in 78% of MPNST and was found to be strongly associated with MMP-13 expression (P = .005). In contrast, 14 neurofibromas lacked MMP-13 and p53 expressions. TP53 mutations were found in only 11% of MPNST and were associated with high tumor grades (P = .029). No significant association between mutant TP53 and MMP-13 was observed, indicating that other factors drive MMP-13 expression in MPNST. The presence of metastasis was linked to p53Pro(72) polymorphism (P = .041) and shorter survival. In summary, our data suggest that MMP-13 expression in nerve sheath tumors is coupled with malignant progression. Therefore, MMP-13 may serve as a marker for progression and as a therapeutic target",

    "Title": "Expression analysis of pancreatic cancer cell lines reveals association of enhanced gene transcription and genomic amplifications at the 8q22.1 and 8q24.22 loci",
    "Abstract": "Despite tremendous effort and progress in the diagnostics of pancreatic cancer with respect to imaging techniques and molecular genetics, only very few patients can be cured by surgery leading to a 5-year survival rate of only 3%. Especially the lack of chemotherapeutical options in this entity requires a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to pancreatic carcinoma growth and progression in order to develop novel treatment regimens. To identify signaling pathways that are critical for this tumor entity, we compared six well-established pancreatic cancer cell lines (Capan-1, Capan-2, HUP-T3, HUP-T4, KCL-MOH, PaTu-8903) with colon cancer cell lines and tumor cell lines of non-epithelial origin by expression profiling. For this purpose we employed Human Genome Focus Arrays representing about 8500 well annotated human genes. We identified 353 genes with significantly high expression in the group of pancreatic carcinomas. Based on Gene Ontology annotations these genes are especially involved in Rho protein signal transduction, proteasome activator activity, cell motility, apoptotic program, and cell-cell adhesion processes indicating these pathways to be interesting candidates for the design of targeted therapies. Most pancreatic carcinomas are characterized by mutations in the TP53 and the KRAS genes and the absence of microsatellite instability, which could also be confirmed for our panel of pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Looking for individual differences within this group that may be responsible for more or less aggressive behavior, we identified genomic amplifications at the 8q22.1 and the 8q24.22 loci to be associated with enhanced gene transcription. Because we have previously shown that gains of genomic material from the long arm of chromosome 8 have an adverse effect on the outcome of pancreatic carcinoma patients, we conclude that functional analysis of amplified genes at 8q22 and/or 8q24 may lead to an improved understanding of pancreatic carcinoma progression",

    "Title": "Loss of TP53-DNA interaction induced by p.C135R in lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor gene (TP53; OMIM: 191170) plays an important role in tumorigenesis in lung epithelial cells. TP53 encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that regulates transcription of several genes in response to DNA damage promoting cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis. A mutation does not necessarily alter the protein function and since not all altered tumor protein p53 (TP53) conformations lead to the same biological properties, we studied Cys135Arg TP53 gene mutation in squamous cell type of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing. Cys135Arg TP53 mutation, rare in databases (11/23544 in R11, IARC TP53 database), was detected. We chose p.C135R in order to examine DNA-TP53 interaction. A comparison with the wild-type after 1 nano-second molecular dynamic simulation analysis revealed a significant structural change (over 4A displacement) in the contact loop Lys-Ser-Val which lies upstream and next to the mutated site in the TP53, that sterically prevents its DNA-binding activity. Additionally, the mutation produced a change in the electrostatic potential surface of the protein in the same loop where the structural modification took place. To demonstrate the degree of loss of function, functional assays in yeast and bacteria with oligonucleotides for competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were done proving that this mutation decreases TP53 ability to bind DNA of the TP53 response element from the human p21 gene. These results demonstrate that the amino acid change C135R in the human TP53 generates the loss of TP53 DNA-binding activity directly affecting its role as a transcription factor and suggests that this observation can explain part of the phenotype described in patients affected by this type of tumor",

    "Title": "Mistaken Identity of Widely Used Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Cell Line TE-7",
    "Abstract": "Cancer of the esophagus is the seventh leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Esophageal carcinoma cell lines are useful models to study the biological and genetic alterations in these tumors. An important prerequisite of cell line research is the authenticity of the used cell lines because the mistaken identity of a cell line may lead to invalid conclusions. Estimates indicate that up to 36% of the cell lines are of a different origin or species than supposed. The TE series, established in late 1970s and early 1980s by Nishihira et al. in Japan, is one of the first esophageal cancer cell line series that was used throughout the world. Fourteen TE cell lines were derived from human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and one, TE-7, was derived from a primary esophageal adenocarcinoma. In numerous studies, this TE-7 cell line was used as a model for esophageal adenocarcinoma because it is one of the few esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines existing. We investigated the authenticity of the esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line TE-7 by xenografting, short tandem repeat profiling, mutation analyses, and array-comparative genomic hybridization and showed that cell line TE-7 shared the same genotype as the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines TE-2, TE-3, TE-12, and TE-13. In addition, for more than a decade, independent TE-7 cultures from Japan, United States, United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands had the same genotype. Examination of the TE-7 cell line xenograft revealed the histology of a squamous cell carcinoma. We conclude that the TE-7 cell line, used in several laboratories throughout the world, is not an adenocarcinoma, but a squamous cell carcinoma cell line. Furthermore, the cell lines TE-2, TE-3, TE-7, TE-12, and TE-13 should be regarded as one single squamous cell carcinoma cell line. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):7996-8001]",

    "Abstract": "Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor with proven efficacy in multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study reports the effects of bortezomib in B-cell lymphoma cell lines with differing sensitivity to bortezomib to investigate factors that influence sensitivity. Bortezomib induced a time- and concentration-dependent reduction in cell viability in five lymphoma cell lines, with EC(50) values ranging from 6 nmol/L (DHL-7 cells) to 25 nmol/L (DHL-4 cells) after 72 h. Bortezomib cytotoxicity was independent of p53 function, as all cell lines exhibited mutations by sequence analysis. The difference in sensitivity was not explained by proteasome or nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibition as these were similar in the most and least sensitive cells. NF-kappaB inhibition was less marked than that of a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor, Bay 11-7082. Cell cycle analysis showed a marked G(2)-arrested population in the least sensitive DHL-4 line only, an effect that was not present with Bay 11-7082 treatment. Conversely, in DHL-7 cells, bortezomib treatment resulted in cells moving into an aberrant mitosis, indicative of mitotic catastrophe that may contribute to increased sensitivity to bortezomib. These studies show that although bortezomib treatment had similar effects on apoptotic and NF-kappaB signaling pathways in these cell lines, different cell cycle effects were observed and induction of a further mechanism of cell death, mitotic catastrophe, was observed in the more sensitive cell line, which may provide some pointers to the difference in sensitivity between cell lines. An improved understanding of how DHL-7 cells abrogate the G(2)-M cell cycle checkpoint may help identify targets to increase the efficacy of bortezomib",

    "Title": "p53 determines multidrug sensitivity of childhood neuroblastoma",
    "Abstract": "For pediatric cancers like neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid tumor of infancy, p53 mutations are rare at diagnosis, but may be acquired after chemotherapy, suggesting a potential role in drug resistance. Heavy metal-selected neuroblastoma cells were found to acquire an unusually broad multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype but displayed no alterations in genes associated with 'classic' MDR. These cells had acquired a mutant p53 gene, linking p53 to drug sensitivity in neuroblastoma. We therefore generated p53-deficient variants in neuroblastoma cell lines with wild-type p53 by transduction of p53-suppressive constructs encoding either short hairpin RNA or a dominant-negative p53 mutant. Analysis of these cells indicated that (a) in contrast to previous reports, wild-type p53 was fully functional in all neuroblastoma lines tested; (b) inactivation of p53 in neuroblastoma cells resulted in establishment of a MDR phenotype; (c) p53-dependent senescence, the primary response of some neuroblastoma cells to DNA damage, is replaced after p53 inactivation by mitotic catastrophe and subsequent apoptosis; (d) knockdown of mutant p53 did not revert the MDR phenotype, suggesting it is determined by p53 inactivation rather than gain of mutant function. These results suggest the importance of p53 status as a prognostic marker of treatment response in neuroblastoma. p53 suppression may have opposite effects on drug sensitivity as determined by analysis of isogenic pairs of tumor cell lines of nonneuroblastoma origin, indicating the importance of tissue context for p53-mediated modulation of tumor cell sensitivity to treatment",

    "Title": "Downregulation of ING3 mRNA expression predicts poor prognosis in head and neck cancer",
    "Abstract": "Although many clinical and pathological prognostic factors such as tumor stage and lymph-node involvement have been described, to date no reliable or clinically applicable marker or tumor aggressiveness has been identified for head and neck cancer. In an attempt to identify such a molecular prognostic marker, we analyzed the mRNA expression status of ING3 by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We also examined p53 mutation status and investigated its relationship with ING3, as well its clinicopathological characteristics. About half of the 71 tumor samples demonstrated downregulation of ING3 compared to their matched normal counterparts. Although most clinicopathological variables were not significantly related to ING3 downregulation or p53 mutation status, a significant relationship was detected in terms of overall survival between the cases with low and normal to high ING3 expression. At 5 years follow up, approximately 60% of the patients with normal to high ING3 expression survived, whereas this was 35% in the patients with low ING3 expression. Multivariate analysis also showed downregulation of ING3 as an independent prognostic factor for poor overall survival. These results reveal that ING3 would function as a potential tumor suppressor molecule and that low levels of ING3 may indicate an aggressive nature of head and neck cancer",

    "Title": "p53 gene mutations in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and their relevance to etiology and pathogenesis: results in Japan and comparisons with other countries",
    "Abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is a form of cancer that has varying incidence rates among different countries, distinct geographic areas and different ethnic groups. According to previous reports, p53 gene mutations have been identified in 20-80% of these tumors, and these mutations have occurred at an early stage. These findings suggest that such mutations play an important role in esophageal carcinogenesis, and highlight the importance of mutagens, which cause sequence alterations in the p53 gene. In order to clarify the environmental factors and the molecular mechanisms that may be responsible for the occurrence and prevention of a specific mutation in the process of esophageal carcinogenesis, we analyzed p53 gene mutations in 95 samples of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. We further reviewed published reports investigating the frequency of p53 gene mutations in esophageal cancer from high-risk areas to normal-risk areas and compared these findings to our results in Japan. The frequency of p53 gene mutations in Japanese esophageal cancer is 47.4% and there are three prominent features: (1) a predominance of transversions, in particular the G:C to T:A transversion; (2) a relatively low frequency of transitions; and (3) a relatively high percentage of frameshift mutations. These results indicate the possible importance of the benzo[a]pyrene metabolite and oxidative DNA damage in esophageal carcinogenesis and scarcely correlate with DNA replication errors or alkylation in comparison to other gastrointestinal cancers. In addition, we observed a peculiar sequence of frameshift mutations. Taken together, these data suggest that this tumor suppressor gene plays a critical role in the multistep carcinogenesis process for esophageal squamous cell cancer",

    "Title": "Apaf1 in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) progression: reduced Apaf1 expression is correlated with a H179R p53 mutation during clinical blast crisis",
    "Abstract": "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a stem cell disorder that eventually progresses to a blast crisis phase (BC) characterized by distorted apoptotic pathways. The exact mechanism leading to failure in apoptotic pathways during CML progression is unclear. In view of the central role of p53 and apaf1 in the apoptotic machinery we examined six human paired chronic and BC phases samples for their expression. Real-time PCR (RQ-PCR) experiments showed an elevation of p53 mRNA in all patients during transition to BC. However, elevation of apaf1 during BC was observed in five patients only. In contrast, one patient displayed a significant 11.5-fold reduction of apaf1 expression during the transition to BC. No apaf1 promoter methylation was observed. The reduced apaf1 expression was accompanied by a trans-dominant point mutation (H179R) in one p53 allele and the loss of the other. This mutant p53, when tested using functionality assays, was unable to activate apaf1, consequently explaining the reduced expression observed in this patient. Furthermore, the same mutant failed to activate either genes involved in apoptotic or cell cycle arrest pathways, and can be considered as a complete loss of function mutation. This specific mutation was reported in several types of cancer, but was not implicated in CML. To conclude, in this study we have demonstrated mRNA elevation of p53 and apaf1 during CML blast crisis, indicating that genes and proteins involved in cellular apoptosis might be involved in disease progression/response to therapy. Moreover, the mutated p53 discovered in the patient exhibiting lowered apaf1 expression provides, in a clinical case, the first correlation between p53 and apaf1 transcription regulation in humans",

    "Title": "Transcriptome classification of HCC is related to gene alterations and to new therapeutic targets",
    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors that differ in risk factors and genetic alterations. We further investigated transcriptome-genotype-phenotype correlations in HCC. Global transcriptome analyses were performed on 57 HCCs and 3 hepatocellular adenomas and validated by quantitative RT-PCR using 63 additional HCCs. We determined loss of heterozygosity, gene mutations, promoter methylation of CDH1 and CDKN2A, and HBV DNA copy number for each tumor. Unsupervised transcriptome analysis identified 6 robust subgroups of HCC (G1-G6) associated with clinical and genetic characteristics. G1 tumors were associated with low copy number of HBV and overexpression of genes expressed in fetal liver and controlled by parental imprinting. G2 included HCCs infected with a high copy number of HBV and mutations in PIK3CA and TP53. In these first groups, we detected specific activation of the AKT pathway. G3 tumors were typified by mutation of TP53 and overexpression of genes controlling the cell cycle. G4 was a heterogeneous subgroup of tumors including TCF1-mutated hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. G5 and G6 were strongly related to beta-catenin mutations that lead to Wnt pathway activation; in particular, G6 tumors were characterized by satellite nodules, higher activation of the Wnt pathway, and E-cadherin underexpression. CONCLUSION: These results have furthered our understanding of the genetic diversity of human HCC and have provided specific identifiers for classifying tumors. In addition, our classification has potential therapeutic implications because 50% of the tumors were related to WNT or AKT pathway activation, which potentially could be targeted by specific inhibiting therapies",

    "Title": "Alternate molecular genetic pathways in ovarian carcinomas of common histological types",
    "Abstract": "We evaluated alterations in p53, PIK3CA, PTEN, CTNNB1 (beta-catenin), MLH1, and BRAF among common histological subsets of epithelial ovarian tumors to characterize patterns of alterations of different molecular pathways. There were 12 clear cell, 26 endometrioid, and 51 serous carcinomas evaluated by direct DNA sequencing for mutations in p53, PIK3CA, PTEN, BRAF, and CTNNB1. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assessed MLH1 promoter methylation status. Quantitative PCR identified PIK3CA amplification in 22 EC/CC and 94 SC. p53 mutations were identified in 25 (49%) of 51 SC, 11 (42%) of 26 EC, and 1 (8.3%) of 12 CC neoplasms and were more common in grade 3 EC (P = .045) and advanced-stage EC/CC (P = .007). PIK3CA mutations were identified in 3 (25%) of 12 CC, 3 (12%) of 26 EC, and 0 of 51 SC. PTEN mutations were significantly more common in EC (8/26, 31%) compared with CC (0/12; P = .04) and SC (2/51, 4%; P = .002). CTNNB1 mutations were identified, 6 (23%) EC and no CC or SC (P = .008). Both PTEN and CTNNB1 mutations were more common in low-grade EC/CC, whereas PIK3CA mutations occurred only in grade 3 cancers. PTEN and PIK3CA mutations were more common in p53 wild-type tumors (P = .003). PIK3CA amplification occurred in fewer EC/CC (0/22) versus SC (19/94, 20%; P = 0.02) and were slightly more common in p53 wild-type compared with p53 mutant SC (P = .08). Of 26 EC, 22 (85%) had a mutation in one of the genes studied compared with 4 33% of 12 CC (P = .003). Women with EC/CC had significantly better overall survival (P = .0008), and this remained significant after accounting for stage (P=.04). Mutations in p53 or in PTEN/PIK3CA are alternative pathways in ovarian carcinogenesis. Activation of PIK3CA occurs by gene amplification in SC but via somatic mutation of PIK3CA or PTEN in EC and CC. PIK3CA mutations are associated with high-grade tumors, whereas PTEN and CTNNB1 mutations are associated with low-grade tumors. Mutations in p53, PIK3CA, PTEN, and CTNNB1 account for most EC tumors; most CC remain unexplained. EC/CC histology is a favorable prognostic factor",

    "Title": "Gene expression profiles of primary colorectal carcinomas, liver metastases, and carcinomatoses",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that metastases are the leading cause of colorectal cancer deaths, little is known about the underlying molecular changes in these advanced disease stages. Few have studied the overall gene expression levels in metastases from colorectal carcinomas, and so far, none has investigated the peritoneal carcinomatoses by use of DNA microarrays. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate and compare the gene expression patterns of primary carcinomas (n = 18), liver metastases (n = 4), and carcinomatoses (n = 4), relative to normal samples from the large bowel. RESULTS: Transcriptome profiles of colorectal cancer metastases independent of tumor site, as well as separate profiles associated with primary carcinomas, liver metastases, or peritoneal carcinomatoses, were assessed by use of Bayesian statistics. Gains of chromosome arm 5p are common in peritoneal carcinomatoses and several candidate genes (including PTGER4, SKP2, and ZNF622) mapping to this region were overexpressed in the tumors. Expression signatures stratified on TP53 mutation status were identified across all tumors regardless of stage. Furthermore, the gene expression levels for the in vivo tumors were compared with an in vitro model consisting of cell lines representing all three tumor stages established from one patient. CONCLUSION: By statistical analysis of gene expression data from primary colorectal carcinomas, liver metastases, and carcinomatoses, we are able to identify genetic patterns associated with the different stages of tumorigenesis",

    "Abstract": "Although the presence of racial differences in vulvar squamous cell carcinomas has been suggested, fully analyzed data concerning such tumors in Japanese women have not been reported. A total of 21 vulvar squamous cell carcinomas of Japanese women who lived in north-east Japan, were studied with respect to histological subtype, HPV, p53 and p16(INK4a). The majority of tumors consisted of keratinizing and non-keratinizing types (16/21, 76%), all of which were negative for HPV. The remaining five tumors of basaloid, warty or verrucous types were positive for HPV. HPV-negative tumors showed a trend of greater accumulation of gene abnormalities, including p53 gene mutation, than HPV-positive ones. p16(INK4a) overexpression was shown to not always be a marker for vulvar squamous cell carcinoma in Japanese women with activated high-risk HPV",

    "Title": "Genomic and proteomic profiles reveal the association of gelsolin to TP53 status and bladder cancer progression",
    "Abstract": "Bladder cancer transformation and immortalization require the inactivation of key regulatory genes, including TP53. Genotyping of a large cohort of bladder cancer patients (n = 256) using the TP53 GeneChip showed mutations in 103 cases (40.2%), the majority of them mapping to the DNA-binding core domain. TP53 mutation status was significantly associated with tumor stage (P = 0.0001) and overall survival for patients with advanced disease (P = 0.01). Transcript profiling using oligonucleotide arrays was performed on a subset of these cases (n = 46). Supervised analyses identified genes differentially expressed between invasive bladder tumors with wild-type (n = 24) and mutated TP53 (n = 22). Pathway analyses of top-ranked genes supported the central role of TP53 in the functional network of such gene patterns. A proteomic strategy using reverse phase arrays with protein extracts of bladder cancer cell lines validated the association of identified differentially expressed genes, such as gelsolin, to TP53 status. Immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (n = 294) revealed that gelsolin was associated with tumor stage and overall survival, correlating positively with TP53 status in a subset of these patients. This study further reveals that TP53 mutations are frequent events in bladder cancer progression and identified gelsolin related to TP53 status, tumor staging, and clinical outcome by independent high-throughput strategies",

    "Title": "The expression of p53-induced protein with death domain (Pidd) and apoptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "The Pidd (p53-induced protein with death domain) gene was shown to be induced by the tumour suppressor p53 and to mediate p53-dependent apoptosis in mouse and human cells, through interactions with components of both the mitochondrial and the death receptor signalling pathways. To study the role of Pidd in clinical tumours, we measured its expression by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in microdissected oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) with and without p53 mutation. Tumour cell apoptosis was assessed by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling. Tumour proliferation was assessed by immunohistochemical staining for the Ki-67 antigen. We found a wide range of Pidd expression among OSCC. Statistical analysis revealed an association between Pidd expression and apoptotic index (Mann-Whitney test, P<0.001), consistent with a role of Pidd in apoptosis in this tumour type. Furthermore, we showed a positive correlation between apoptotic index and proliferative index that has not been previously described for OSCC. There was no correlation between Pidd expression and the p53 mutation status of these tumours, suggesting that Pidd expression may be regulated by p53-independent mechanisms. Further characterisation of these molecular defects in the control of proliferation and apoptosis should help in developing treatments that target OSCC according to their biological properties",

    "Title": "Study of p53 gene alteration as a biomarker to evaluate the malignant risk of Lugol-unstained lesion with non-dysplasia in the oesophagus",
    "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 gene are detected frequently in oesophageal dysplasia and cancer. It is unclear whether Lugol-unstained lesions (LULs) with non-dysplastic epithelium (NDE) are precursors of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). To study the genetic alterations of NDE in the multistep process of oesophageal carcinogenesis, we determined the relationship between p53 mutations and LULs-NDE. Videoendoscopy with Lugol staining was performed prospectively in 542 oesophageal cancer-free subjects. Lugol-unstained lesions were detected in 103 subjects (19%). A total of 255 samples, including 152 LULs (NDE, 137; dysplasia, 15) and 103 paired samples of normal staining epithelium, were obtained from 103 subjects. After extraction of DNA and polymerase chain reaction analysis, direct sequencing method was applied to detect mutations of the p53 gene. The p53 mutation was detected in five of 137 samples with LULs-NDE (4%) and in five of 15 samples with dysplasia (33%). A hotspot mutation was found in 20% of LULs-NDE with p53 mutation and in 40% of dysplasia with p53 mutation. In contrast, no p53 mutations were found in 103 paired NDE samples with normal Lugol staining. In biopsy samples from oesophageal cancer-free individuals, the p53 missense mutations containing a hotspot mutation were found in NDE, which was identified as an LUL. These findings suggest that some LULs-NDE may represent the earliest state of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Japanese individuals",

    "Title": "BRCA1 and TP53 mutation spectrum of breast carcinoma in an ethnic population of Kashmir, an emerging high-risk area",
    "Abstract": "Breast cancer shows geographical variation in its incidence, even within areas of ethnic homogeneity. Kashmir valley (India), over past few years, witnesses an increase in incidence and occurrence of familial, early onset, and male breast cancer in its unexplored ethnic population. Here, we make a preliminary attempt to estimate the nature and frequency of BRCA1 and TP53 gene mutations of breast cancer patients from Kashmir. PCR-SSCP analysis followed by direct sequencing revealed the presence of only two germline intronic variations (c.199+67T>C and c.5396+187T>C) in BRCA1 gene in only 5.26% (2/38) patients while as 44% (11/25) of sporadic breast cancer patients harboured significant amount of somatic mutations in TP53 (p=0.0074; OR=0.053). The 17 mutations found in TP53 in 11 patients, comprised of 13 substitutions [11 single-base (9 transitions+2 transversions), 1 double-base and 1 complex] and four insertions. The 11 substitutions represent missense mutations, leading to aminoacid substitution while as rest two were silent mutations. The four insertions represented three frame-shifts and one non-sense mutation. The mutation effect data was found to be significant (p=0.0002). Significant amount of mutations were found in exon 6 (p=0.04; OR=0.273) and a combination of exons 6 and 7 (p=0.0145; OR=14.22) of TP53. Comparison of mutation profile with other ethnic populations and regions reflected both differences and similarities indicating co-exposure to a unique set of risk factors. The differences could be due to exposure to particular environmental carcinogens; different lifestyle, reproductive pattern; dietary or cultural practices of Kashmiri women that need further investigations. The infrequent presence of germline BRCA1 mutations in our study agree with the idea that a great proportion of moderate risk breast cancer population could be due to the susceptibility genes distinct from BRCA1. However, high frequency of somatic TP53 gene mutations implicates TP53 as a predominant factor for breast carcinogenesis in moderate risk ethnic Kashmiri population. The study also suggests TP53 as a potential molecular marker and prognostic tool, at least in a subset of sporadic breast tumors",

    "Title": "Oncogenic mutation of the p53 gene derived from head and neck cancer prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis after DNA damage",
    "Abstract": "A p53 functional analysis system, which can identify the types of abnormality of p53, such as loss of function, dominant negative function, or gain of oncogenic function, is now required. In this study, we examined the functional diversity of several mutations of p53 derived from human head and neck cancer cells. The entire open reading frame of p53 cDNA was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pEGFP-C3, and genetic mutations were determined. Then, intracellular localization and transcriptional activity of the tumor-derived p53 proteins were examined in Saos-2 cells. A mutant-p53 (Glu17Lys, His193Leu) or a truncated p53 (Delta121) did not activate the reporters containing p53 responsive elements from p21waf1, BAX, MDM2, p53AIP1, and PUMA genes at all. However, a mutant-p53 (Asn30Ser) showed the transcriptional activity on all of the reporters as wild-type p53 did. On the other hand, a mutant-p53 (Asp281His) activated the p21waf1 promoter strongly and the MDM2 promoter faintly, but did not activate the BAX promoter. Interestingly, this mutant-p53 prevented Saos-2 cells from undergoing apoptosis after treatment with a DNA damaging agent, adriamycin. This mutant-p53 induced cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis. Furthermore, another mutant-p53 (Glu17Lys, His193Leu) also prevented the cells from undergoing apoptosis after DNA damage probably in a transcription-independent manner. These results suggest that some cancer cells may contain the oncogenic mutation of the p53 gene, and the oncogenic p53 protein prevents cancer cells from undergoing apoptosis after DNA damage. Detailed information for mutated p53 gene in cancer cells might provide useful suggestions for the therapeutic strategy",

    "Title": "p53 in esophageal adenocarcinoma: a critical reassessment of mutation frequency and identification of 72Arg as the dominant allele",
    "Abstract": "p53 alterations have been implicated in the progression of Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, the wide range of reported p53 alteration frequencies in esophageal adenocarcinoma makes using p53 as a marker of malignant transformation of Barrett's esophagus problematic. To determine the utility of p53 in Barrett's esophagus monitoring, the frequency of p53 alteration was critically reassessed using esophagectomy specimens of 40 cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma, including 10 with Barrett's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia, 8 with low-grade dysplasia and 7 with no dysplasia. DNA was extracted from tumor cells isolated by laser capture microdissection to maximize the assay sensitivity and mutations in exons 4-8 of p53 were determined by PCR direct sequencing. Mutations in p53 were identified in 75% (30/40) of the esophageal adenocarcinoma. p53 protein overexpression, detected by immunohistochemistry, was found in 58% (23/40) of the esophageal adenocarcinoma, 60% (6/10) of Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia, 12% (1/8) of Barrett's esophagus with low-grade dysplasia, and 0% of Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia. In addition to the mutations, a predominance of the 72Arg allele (89% homozygous) was found over the 72Pro allele in this series. p53 mutation frequency in this study was higher than reported in most of the literature and DNA sequencing detected more p53 alterations than immunohistochemical staining. However, p53 appeared to be a late marker in the neoplastic transformation, and no p53 change was found in approximately 25% of the adenocarcinoma. We concluded that p53 is insufficient as a single marker for Barrett's esophagus monitoring but may be useful as part of a panel due to its high specificity",

    "Abstract": "Biphasic pulmonary blastoma is a rare lung tumor with epithelial and mesenchymal components. Genetic alterations in this tumor are largely unknown, except for the presence of beta-catenin and p53 mutations and the absence of KRAS mutation. To understand the molecular process of histogenesis of this tumor, a whole genome allelic imbalance (AI) scanning using a high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array as well as mutational analysis of the p53, EGFR, KRAS and beta-catenin genes were performed against the epithelial and mesenchymal components in the primary tumor and a metastatic tumor in a case of pulmonary blastoma. AI at chromosome regions 14q24-q32 and 17p11-p13 and beta-catenin mutation were commonly detected in all tumors. On the other hand, AI at chromosome regions 3p11-p14 and 9p21-p24 and p53 mutation were detected only in the mesenchymal component in the primary tumor but not in the epithelial component in the primary tumor and the brain metastasis. Likewise, AI at chromosome regions 6p24-p25 and 6q14-q27 was detected in the epithelial component in the primary tumor and the brain metastasis but not in the mesenchymal component in the primary tumor. Furthermore, the genetic alterations detected in the metastatic tumor were completely the same as those in the epithelial component in the primary tumor, indicating that a tumor cell(s) in the epithelial component in the primary tumor selectively metastasized to the brain. These results indicate that this biphasic tumor is of monoclonal origin and the phenotypic heterogeneity of the tumor is due to the differences in the accumulated genetic alterations in each component of the tumor",

Morphological and immunohistochemical studies showed that KK0206 cells have features of the classic type of SCLC. KK0206 cells grew in suspension, forming relatively small clumps of cells with a doubling time of 72 h. On light microscopy, the cells were relatively small with little cytoplasm. On immunohistochemistry using anti-bovine recoverin rabbit antibody, the cells were intensely positive for recoverin. In addition, they were positive for NSE, Ki-67, and TP53. They also expressed human recoverin, a photoreceptor protein, whose presence was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis with cDNA sequencing and Western blot analysis. The point mutation of their TP53 gene (exon 156) was detected as well. The present study demonstrates that human recoverin is expressed in SCLC cells cultured from an anti-recoverin antibody-negative patient with CAR. KK0206 might be important for further research on SCLC related retinopathy",

    "Abstract": "To clarify whether p53 mutation could be involved in the pathogenesis of various subtypes of lymphoma, we investigated 62 Japanese cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) for p53 gene mutations and their relationship with the expression of p53 protein. Mutations in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene were screened for using the non-isotopic RNase cleavage assay (NIRCA) and confirmed by direct sequencing, followed by immunohistochemical analysis for p53 protein. Missense and/or nonsense mutations of p53 were detected in 3 (10.7%) of 28 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBLs) and 2 (15.4%) of 13 T-cell NHLs (15.4%). A single missense mutation at codon 157 (Val to Phe) in exon 5 and at codon 273 (Arg to Pro) in exon 8 was found respectively in 2 DLBLs and in one peripheral T-cell lymphoma (unspecified). In these 3 cases harbouring a missense mutation, overexpression of p53 protein was observed in more than 80% of tumour cells. Double transversion mutations comprising of a missense mutation at codon 167 (Gln to His) in exon 5 and a nonsense mutation at codon 183 (Ser to stop codon) in exon 5 were detected in one DLBL that had apparently transformed from follicular lymphoma and in one advanced adult T-cell lymphoma (ATL). In these two cases harbouring p53 nonsense mutation, no cells positive for p53 protein immunostaining were detected, as well as lymphomas without p53 mutation",

The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) rates in HCC patients with p53 mutation and p53 wild/hMSH2 mutation significantly decreased compared with those without these mutations (14.3% and 37.5% versus 67.5% for DFS; 35.7% and 50.0% versus 96.4% for OS, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, categories by p53 and hMSH2 mutation status, and liver cirrhosis demonstrated statistical significances for DFS and OS. Moreover, the frequency of patients with p53 and/or hMSH2 mutations in intrahepatic metastasis (75.0%) was significantly higher than that in multicentric occurrence (14.3%). Thus, p53 and hMSH2 mutations will be useful for identifying subsets of HCC patients with poor prognosis",

    "Title": "Activation of AKT and nuclear accumulation of wild type TP53 and MDM2 in anal squamous cell carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is considered as an important aetiological factor for anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) but is not sufficient for tumour progression. This carcinoma is poorly understood at the molecular level. Using the largest cohort of cases to date we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying ASCC development, in particular the roles of TP53, MDM2 and AKT. Viral infection in our cohort occurred at high frequency (73%, 94/128) with HPV16 accounting for the majority (86%, 81/94) of infected cases. Only 4% (5/119) of ASCCs showed TP53 (exons 5-8) mutations, but a high frequency (91%, 100/110) of nuclear protein expression of TP53 was observed. There was a significant association (p < 0.001) between nuclear accumulation of TP53 and MDM2 protein although no MDM2 mutations were found, and copy number was normal. Cellular accumulation of phosphorylated-AKT was observed in 66% (82/125) of ASCCs and an association demonstrated between nuclear accumulation of MDM2 and activated AKT (p < 0.001). We observed a high frequency of copy number gain at PIK3CA (47%), and some coding sequence mutations (4%). Amplification of PIK3CA was associated with presence of phosphorylated-AKT (p= 0.008). There was no association between virus infection and TP53 nuclear accumulation (p = 0.5). However, a significant association was found between infection and MDM2 nuclear staining, and between infection and activated AKT (p = 0.04, p = 0.01, respectively). We propose that activation of AKT, possibly through the PI3K-AKT pathway, is an important component of ASCC tumorigenesis that contributes to MDM2 and TP53 accumulation in the nucleus",

    "Title": "P53 mutations in urinary bladder cancer patients from Central Poland",
    "Abstract": "The present study aimed at detection of P53 gene mutations in cells of urinary bladder neoplasms, as the mutations may be regarded as an independent prognostic factor for progression and recurrence of tumours. In the study, 82 patients with clinically diagnosed urinary bladder tumour were included. The control was composed of DNA samples from urine and blood of 202 healthy patients. Exons 5-8 of the P53 gene were screened for mutations by using multitemperature single-strand conformational polymorphism (MSSCP) analysis. Samples with abnormal MSSCP patterns were subjected to direct sequencing. The frequency of mutations in exons 5-8 of the P53 gene in patients with bladder cancer was lower (3.3% in grade G1, 24% in G2, and 39% in G3) than the data reported in the literature. We found a higher percentage of polymorphism at codon 213 of the P53 gene in bladder cancer patients (6%), compared with the values in the reference group (2.5%). These results were matched with those of the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis. In conclusion, mutations were found mainly in more advanced histopathological and clinical stages of the disease and at the CIS stage (carcinoma in situ). It cannot be excluded that the observed polymorphism at codon 213 may be a predisposing factor for urinary bladder carcinoma development",

    "Title": "Prognostic and predictive importance of p53 and RAS for adjuvant chemotherapy in non small-cell lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: p53 and RAS are multifunctional proteins that are critical to cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, cell survival, gene transcription, response to stress, and DNA repair. We have evaluated the prognostic and predictive value of p53 gene/protein aberrations using tumor samples from JBR.10, a North American phase III intergroup trial that randomly assigned 482 patients with completely resected stage IB and II non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to receive four cycles of adjuvant cisplatin plus vinorelbine or observation alone. METHODS: p53 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Mutations in exons 5 to 9 of the p53 gene were determined by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and confirmed by sequencing. RAS mutations were identified by allelic specific oligonucleotide hybridization. RESULTS: Of 253 patients, 132 (52%) were positive for p53 protein overexpression. Untreated p53-positive patients had significantly shorter overall survival than did patients with p53-negative tumors (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.89; 95% CI, 1.07 to 3.34; P = .03). However, these p53-positive patients also had a significantly greater survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (HR = 0.54; P = .02) compared with patients with p53-negative tumors (HR = 1.40; P = .26; interaction P = .02). Mutations of p53 and RAS genes were found in 124 (31%) of 397 and 117 (26%) of 450 patients, respectively. Mutations in these genes were neither prognostic for survival nor predictive of a differential benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: p53 protein overexpression is a significant prognostic marker of shortened survival, and also a significant predictive marker for a differentially greater benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in completely resected NSCLC patients",

    "Title": "Clinical and molecular characteristics of malignant transformation of low-grade glioma in children",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To analyze the clinical and molecular characteristics of malignant transformation (MT) of low-grade glioma (LGG) in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical, radiologic, and histologic characteristics of children treated at our institution who experienced MT of LGG were reviewed. Molecular alterations in these tumors were analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and TP53 sequencing. Cumulative incidence estimate and risk factors for MT were determined for 65 patients with grade 2 astrocytoma treated at our institution during the study interval. RESULTS: Eleven patients who experienced MT were identified (median age at diagnosis of LGG, 13.3 years). Initial diagnoses were grade 2 astrocytoma (n = 6) and other grade 1/2 gliomas (n = 5). The median latency of MT was 5.1 years. Histologic diagnoses after MT were glioblastoma (n = 7) and other high-grade gliomas (n = 4). The 15-year cumulative incidence estimate of MT among 65 patients with grade 2 astrocytoma was 6.7% +/- 3.9%; no risk factor analyzed, including radiotherapy, was associated with MT. Tissue was available for molecular analysis in all patients, including nine with samples obtained before and after MT. TP53 overexpression was more common after MT. Deletions of RB1 and/or CDKN2A were observed in 71% of LGGs and in 90% of tumors after MT. PTEN pathway abnormalities occurred in 76% of patients. One of five oncogenes analyzed (PDGFRA) was amplified in one patient. CONCLUSION: The molecular abnormalities that occur during MT of LGG in children are similar to those observed in primary and secondary glioblastoma in adults",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Familial soft tissue sarcomas are extremely rare. There is little information available on the clinical features and molecular findings of the hereditary occurrence of mesenchymal tumor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A woman and her younger brother had malignant fibrous histiocytoma (pleomorphic type) and liposarcoma (pleomorphic type) in the lower limbs, respectively. Analysis of p53 mutations in exons 5-9 of the tumor and in germ-line was done. RESULTS: A guanine to adenine substitution occurred in CGC, codon 175 of exon 5 in p53 gene, to CAC in the tumor sample of Case 1. Likewise, a thymine to cytosine substitution occurred in TTT, codon 270 of exon 8 in p53 gene, to TCT in tumor sample of Case 2. Germline mutations were not seen in the either patients. CONCLUSIONS: Different missense mutations of p53 were detected in each tumor, however no germline mutations of p53 were found. The alteration of codon 175 in Case 1 is relatively common mutation. On the contrary, the mutation in codon 270 in Case 2 was extremely rare in cancers. Further molecular investigation is needed to understand the mechanism in familial occurrence of sarcomas",

    "Abstract": "We described the case of an unusual, complex genetic alteration in 57 year-old male patient with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with short survival (6 and half months). Alterations consisted of p53 mutation, LOH 10, LOH 17, LOH 19q and EGFR amplification. LOH1p, LOH 9 and LOH 13 were negative. Immunohistochemical study did not correlate with molecular results. The overexpression of TP53 protein and RB protein was detected only in small percentage of cells and interestingly the overexpression of EGFR was present only focally. Immnunostainings for PTEN, P16, PI3-K were negative. Additionally, we observed an overexpression of IGFB2 protein. This case indicates the accumulation of molecular changes in glioblastoma multiforme in patient with short survival",

    "Title": "Low prevalence of p53, p16(INK4a) and Ha-ras tumour-specific mutations in low-graded actinic keratosis",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet radiation induces DNA damage and is the major risk factor for the development of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Different mutation rates of p53, p16(INK4a) and Ha-ras in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and the earlier stage actinic keratosis (AK) have been reported. OBJECTIVES: To assess the presence of missense mutations in hotspot exons of p53, p16(INK4a) and Ha-ras in low-graded AK. PATIENTS/METHODS: Cryo-biopsies of 75 sun-exposed AK lesions and 75 sun-shielded areas of normal skin from 75 AK patients were analysed to identify mutations in p53 (exons 7 and 8), p16(INK4a) (exon 2) and Ha-ras (exon 1) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by direct sequencing. As a representative subset of the specimens, ten mutation-negative AK were also micro-dissected in order to exclude the possibility that additional mutations were undetected. RESULTS: Eight missense and one nonsense point mutations were found in the 75 AK lesions examined (12%), of which seven (9%) were tumour-specific (i.e. present in AK lesions only) and two (3%) were p16(INK4a) mutations (i.e. also detected in normal skin). Three of the tumour-specific mutations (42%) were cytosine (C) to thymine (T) transitions at pyrimidine-rich sequences. Tumour-specific mutations were identified in 1% of p16(INK4a) (exon 2), 1% of Ha-ras (exon 1) and at a higher rate of 7% in p53 (exons 7 and 8), including one nonsense mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of a large number of AK specimens in this study have found a low gene mutation rate in low-graded AK lesions. p53 mutations rather than p16(INK4a) and/or Ha-ras mutations may be an early event in the development of AK to cutaneous SCC",

    "Title": "Loss of CDKN2A and p14ARF expression occurs frequently in human nonmelanoma skin cancers",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The CDKN2A locus on human chromosome 9p21 encodes two proteins named p16INK4a and p14ARF, known to function as tumour suppressors via the retinoblastoma (Rb) or the p53 pathway. The p53 tumour suppressor gene is the most commonly mutated gene in human and mouse cancers. Disruption of the p53 and Rb pathways is a fundamental trend of most human cancer cells. Recent studies have shown that the CDKN2A gene plays an active role in the p53 and Rb tumour suppressor pathways. Genetic abnormalities in CDKN2A have been well documented in human melanoma, but their involvement in nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is less clear. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether genetic abnormalities in CDKN2A and p53 genes play a role in the development of NMSC. METHODS: We analysed 40 primary NMSCs in 40 patients (21 squamous cell carcinomas, 17 basal cell carcinomas and two actinic keratoses) for p16INK4a and p14ARF protein expression and for genetic alterations in exons 1alpha, 1beta and 2 of CDKN2A. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed loss of expression of p16INK4a and p14ARF proteins in 38 and 39 of 40 NMSCs, respectively. Amplification of genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction revealed homozygous deletion of exon 1beta in 20% of tumours and of exon 2 in 82.5% of tumours. Of 22 NMSCs with p53 mutations, 13 (59%) had ultraviolet (UV) signature mutations in the p53 gene; all of them were strongly positive for p53 immunostaining. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to mutations in the p53 gene, loss of expression of CDKN2A via deletion also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of human NMSC. While p53 mutations are induced by UVB, deletions in CDKN2A could arise spontaneously, perhaps during tumour progression",

    "Title": "Inactivation of the CDKN2A and the p53 tumour suppressor genes in external genital carcinomas and their precursors",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: p53 has been extensively studied in external genital carcinoma (EGC), and is frequently inactivated, but little is known about the role of the CDKN2A tumour suppressor gene in the oncogenesis of EGC. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of CDKN2A and p53 in the pathogenesis of EGCs and their precursor lesions vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN3), penile intraepithelial neoplasia and lichen sclerosus (LS). METHODS: By means of CDKN2A and p53 mutation screening (single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and sequencing), methylation analysis of alternative CDKN2A promoters (methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction) and p53 immununochemistry, we analysed eight invasive EGCs (five from vulva and three from penis) and 25 precancerous lesions (two undifferentiated VIN3 and 23 vulval/penile lesions of LS) from 33 patients. RESULTS: p53 mutations (mainly transversions) and CDKN2A mutations (including one hot spot) were present in 75% and 50% of invasive tumours, respectively, but were absent in all precancerous lesions. Remarkably, all CDKN2A-mutated tumours also harboured a p53 mutation. CDKN2A or p53 mutations were observed more frequently in LS-derived EGCs than in human papillomavirus-derived EGCs (P = 0.053). A positive anti-p53 staining, but without p53 mutations, was also detected in 30% of LS lesions, suggesting a p53 stabilization in response to inflammation and carcinogenic insult. Methylation of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) promoters was not a frequent mechanism of CDKN2A inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a high prevalence of co-inactivating mutations of p53 and/or CDKN2A genes in EGC, that seem to occur preferentially in LS-derived tumours and late in oncogenesis",

    "Abstract": "This study was undertaken to further elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying the frequent event of transformation of follicular lymphoma (FL) to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (t-FL). The gene expression profiles of 20 paired lymph node biopsies, derived from the same patient pre- and post-transformation, were analysed using the Lymphochip cDNA microarray. TP53 mutation analysis was performed and copy number alterations at the c-REL and CDNK2A examined. Immunohistochemistry was performed on an independent panel of paired transformation paraffin-embedded samples. Transformed follicular lymphoma was predominantly of the germinal centre B-like phenotype both at the mRNA and protein level. Despite this homogeneity, transformation proceeded by at least two pathways. One mechanism was characterised by high proliferation, as assessed by the co-ordinately expressed genes of the proliferation signature. This group was associated with the presence of recurrent oncogenic abnormalities. In the remaining cases, proliferation was not increased and transformation proceeded by alternative routes as yet undetermined. Genes involved in cellular proliferation prevailed amongst those that were significantly increased upon transformation and T cell and follicular dendritic-associated genes predominated amongst those that decreased. t-FL is a germinal centre B (GCB)-like malignancy that evolves by two pathways, one that is similar in proliferation rate to the antecedent FL and the other that has a higher proliferation rate and is characterised by the presence of recognised oncogenic abnormalities",

We analysed by direct sequencing or loss of heterozygosity assay, the common targets of genomic alterations in 42 hepatocellular carcinomas collected in western North-Africa. Overall, genomic instability was uncommon, allelic losses affecting mostly chromosomes 1p, 4q, 8p and 17p (24-28% of cases). CTNNB1 and TP53 were infrequently mutated (9 and 17% of cases, respectively). Surprisingly, TP53 mutation R249S, diagnostic of aflatoxin B1 exposure, usually frequent in Africa, was exceptional (one case), indicating that in western North-Africa, hepatocellular carcinoma genetics differs markedly from that of the remainder of the continent",

    "Abstract": "Although p53 overexpression detected by immunohistochemistry has been reported in pituitary adenomas and carcinomas, genetic mutations in the p53 gene have not been previously detected in these tumors. We analyzed a series of eight pituitary adenomas and six pituitary carcinomas by immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction amplification, and sequencing of p53 exon 5 through exon 8 for genetic mutations. Three carcinomas showed more than 20% expression of p53 protein in the tumor cells. One of these tumors with 60% overexpression of p53 protein had a mutation in codon 248, a common 'hot spot' for p53 mutation, while the other carcinoma with 90% overexpression of p53 protein had a mutation in codon 135. All adenomas were negative for p53 mutations and had 15% of the cells expressing the p53 protein. Analysis of control tumors including four lung carcinomas with proven p53 mutations also had greater than 85% of the tumor cells overexpressing p53 protein. Two breast carcinoma cell lines with known p53 mutations, MBA-MD 231 and MBA-MD-486, also showed greater than 85% of the tumor cells overexpressing p53. These results show that p53 mutations are present in a subset of pituitary carcinomas and are usually associated with a high percentage of tumor cells overexpressing the p53 protein",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The potential anticancer agent 1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195), a translocator protein (18KDa) (TSPO) ligand, facilitates the induction of cell death by a variety of cytotoxic and chemotherapeutic agents. Primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells overexpress TSPO. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of PK11195 on CLL cells. Table 1.Characteristics of the patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using cytometric analysis, we studied the cytotoxic effects of PK11195 on peripheral B and T lymphocytes from patients with CLL and from healthy donors. Western blot and cytometric analyses were used to study the mitochondrial effects of PK11195 on CLL cells. Moreover, we analyzed the cytotoxic effect of PK11195 in patients' cells with mutated p53 or ATM. RESULTS: PK11195 induces apoptosis and had additive effects with chemotherapeutic drugs in primary CLL cells. Other TSPO ligands such as RO 5-4864 and FGIN-1-27 also induce apoptosis in CLL cells. PK11195 induces mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release upstream of caspase activation, and dithiocyana-tostilbene-2,2- disulfonic acid (DIDS), a voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) inhibitor, inhibits PK11195-induced apoptosis, demonstrating a direct involvement of mitochondria. CLL cells and normal B cells are more sensitive than T cells to PK11195-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, PK11195 induced apoptosis in CLL cells irrespective of their p53 or ATM status. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PK11195 alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs might be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of CLL",

    "Title": "Establishment and characterization of Asian oral cancer cell lines as in vitro models to study a disease prevalent in Asia",
    "Abstract": "We have established 3 cell lines ORL-48, -115 and -136 from surgically resected specimens obtained from untreated primary human oral squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity. The in vitro growth characteristics, epithelial origin, in vitro anchorage independency, human papilloma-virus (HPV) infection, microsatellite instability status, karyotype and the status of various cell cycle regulators and gatekeepers of these cell lines were investigated. All 3 cell lines grew as monolayers with doubling times ranging between 26.4 and 40.8 h and were immortal. Karyotyping confirmed that these cell lines were of human origin with multiple random losses and gains of entire chromosomes and regions of chromosomes. Immunohistochemistry staining of cytokeratins confirmed the epithelial origin of these cell lines, and the low degree of anchorage independency expressed by these cell lines suggests non-transformed phenotypes. Genetic analysis identified mutations in the p53 gene in all cell lines and hypermethylation of p16INK4a in ORL-48 and -136. Analysis of MDM2 and EGFR expression indicated MDM2 overexpression in ORL-48 and EGFR overexpression in ORL-136 in comparison to the protein levels in normal oral keratinocytes. Analysis of the BAT-26 polyadenine repeat sequence and MLH-1 and MSH-2 repair enzymes demonstrated that all 3 cell lines were microsatellite stable. The role of HPV in driving carcinogenesis in these tumours was negated by the absence of HPV. Finally, analysis of the tissues from which these cell lines were derived indicated that the cell lines were genetically representative of the tumours, and, therefore, are useful tools in the understanding of the molecular changes associated with oral cancers",

    "Abstract": "AIM: This study is directed towards understanding the complex interplay between Human papilloma Virus (HPV) infection and p53 gene alteration in a set of 92 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and 28 leukoplakia samples from eastern India. METHODS: DNA isolated from the patient samples were subjected to HPV detection, Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of the chromosome 17p region harboring p53, genotyping at the p53 codon 72 locus followed by sequencing of the entire p53 gene to identify somatic mutations. Codon 72 heterozygotes carrying p53 mutation were further cloned and resequenced to identify the allele harboring the mutation. RESULTS: HPV positivity in the HNSCC samples was found to be 69% while 21% percent of the HNSCC were found to harbor p53 mutations in the coding region of the gene. The absence of p53 mutation in HPV positive tumors was found to be statistically significant compared to the HPV negative tumors (p=0.01) but the same did not hold true for p53 LOH (p=1.0). Among the germline p53 codon 72 heterozygotes, the Pro allele was preferentially lost (p=0.02) while the Arg allele was mutated in majority cases. We also observed that the risk of HPV mediated tumorigenesis increased with the increase in number of Arg alleles at the codon 72 locus. CONCLUSION: We propose that genetic and epigenetic alteration of p53 follow distinct pathways during the development of HNSCC from normal epithelium via dysplasia. p53 mutation and HPV mediated p53 inactivation possibly constitute two independent pathways of tumorigenesis",

    "Abstract": "Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma is a rare, highly malignant variant of chondrosarcoma in which a high-grade sarcoma coexists with a low-grade chondroid tumor. We herein review a case of dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma with an osteosarcoma omit component that occurred in the distal femur of a 38-year-old man. We established the cell line (NDCS-1) from a pleural effusion of the metastatic lung tumor. The cell line was characterized by a the G-banded karyotype, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, spectral karyotyping, and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The tumor exhibited complex karyotypes and a high frequency of chromosomal amplication with p53 mutation. This tumor revealed an osteoblastic and chondroblastic character in vitro and in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. The expression and phosphorylation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta, which seemed to play a major role in the malignant phenotype of chondrosarcoma, was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the establishment of a human dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma",

    "Title": "Anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid arising more often from follicular carcinoma than papillary carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), a rare and highly malignant tumor, has long been thought to arise from well-differentiated carcinoma (WDC) such as follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The purpose of this study was to test this notion by examining whether and, if so, how often ATC harbors the oncogenes that are commonly associated with WDC, such as RAS in FTC and BRAF in PTC. METHODS: We analyzed the mutation hotspots of BRAF (codon 600) and N-, K-, and H-RAS (codons 12, 13, and 61) in 16 ATCs. We also examined two genes, PIK3CA (exons 9 and 20) and TP53 (exons 5-9), both of which have been reported in ATCs. RESULTS: The results showed that approximately 31% (5 of 16) of ATCs harbored N-RAS mutation, 6% (1 of 16) had mutated BRAF, and approximately 56% (9 of 16) had mutated TP53. As to the three ATCs that had coexisted PTCs, mutated BRAF was detected in all PTC components but only in one ATC, while mutated PIK3CA was found in only one PTC component but not in the ATC. CONCLUSION: A number of ATCs arise from WDCs, more often from RAS-mutant tumors than from BRAF-mutant tumors, implying that particular attention should be paid to the WDC harboring RAS mutation",

    "Title": "Analysis of skin cancer risk factors in immunosuppressed renal transplant patients shows high levels of UV-specific tandem CC to TT mutations of the p53 gene",
    "Abstract": "Immunosuppressed renal transplant recipients (RTRs) are predisposed to non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), predominantly squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). We have analyzed skin lesions from RTRs with aggressive tumors for p53 gene modifications, the presence of Human Papillomas Virus (HPV) DNA in relation to the p53 codon 72 genotype and polymorphisms of the XPD repair gene. We detected 24 p53 mutations in 15/25 (60%) NMSCs, 1 deletion and 23 base substitutions, the majority (78%) being UV-specific C to T transitions at bipyrimidine sites. Importantly, 35% (6/17) are tandem mutations, including 4 UV signature CC to TT transitions possibly linked to modulated DNA repair caused by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). We found 8 p53 mutations in 7/17 (41%) precancerous actinic keratosis (AK), suggesting that p53 mutations are early events in RTR skin carcinogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis shows a good correlation between p53 accumulation and mutations. HPV DNA was detected in 78% of skin lesions (60% Basal Cell Carcinomas, 82%AK and 79% SCCs). Thus, immunosuppression has increased the risk of infections by HPVs, predominantly epidermodysplasia verruciformis, speculated to play a role in skin cancer development. No association is found between HPV status and p53 mutation. Moreover, p53 codon 72 or frequencies of three XPD genotypes of RTRs are comparable with control populations. The p53 mutation spectrum, presenting a high level of CC to TT mutations, shows that the UV component of sunlight is the major risk factor and modulated DNA repair by immunosuppressive drug treatment may be significant in the skin carcinogenesis of RTRs",

    "Title": "Mutations in TP53 are a prognostic factor in colorectal hepatic metastases undergoing surgical resection",
    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic value of TP53 mutations in a consecutive series of patients with hepatic metastases (HMs) from colorectal cancer undergoing surgical resection. Ninety-one patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma were included. Mutational analysis of TP53, exons 4-10, was performed by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing. P53 and P21 protein immunostaining was assessed. Multivariate Cox models were adjusted for gender, number of metastasis, resection margin, presence of TP53 mutations and chemotherapy treatment. Forty-six of 91 (50.05%) metastases showed mutations in TP53, observed mainly in exons 5-8, although 14.3% (n = 13) were located in exons 9 and 10. Forty percent (n = 22) were protein-truncating mutations. TP53 status associated with multiple (> or =3) metastases (65.6%, P = 0.033), advanced primary tumor Dukes' stage (P = 0.011) and younger age (<57 years old, P = 0.03). Presence of mutation associated with poor prognosis in univariate (P = 0.017) and multivariate Cox model [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-3.06, P = 0.028]. Prognostic value was maintained in patients undergoing radical resection (R0 series, n = 79, P = 0.014). Mutation associated with a worse outcome in chemotherapy-treated patients (HR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.12-5.75, P = 0.026). The combination of > or =3 metastases and TP53 mutation identified a subset of patients with very poor prognosis (P = 0.009). P53 and P21 protein immunostaining did not show correlation with survival. TP53 mutational status seems to be an important prognostic factor in patients undergoing surgical resection of colorectal cancer HMs",

    "Abstract": "AIMS: Mutation of c-kit is a relatively early event in the tumorigenesis of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs). The aim was to determine the prognostic significance of p53 alterations as an additional genetic change in GISTs. METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed 125 patients with localized GISTs subjected to complete resection between 1990 and 2002. Mutational analyses of c-kit exons 9, 11, 13 and 17, p53 exons 4-8 and immunohistochemistry for p53 protein were conducted using paraffin-embedded tissues. Alterations of p53 were observed in 50 patients (40.0%). Based on the National Institutes of Health's risk category, p53 alterations were noted more frequently in the higher risk categories (P = 0.041). With a median follow-up of 56.5 months (range: 2.3-126.8), 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were 61.7% without p53 alterations, compared with only 40.2% with p53 alterations (P = 0.009). Multivariate analysis indicated that p53 alterations comprised an independent, poor prognostic factor for RFS, in addition to c-kit mutations, large size, a high mitotic count and non-gastric primary sites. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in p53 were more commonly observed in localized GISTs at higher risk of relapse. This suggests that they are significant as an independent, poor prognostic factor",

    "Title": "Intraductal carcinoma is the precursor of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma and is often associated with dysfunctional p53",
    "Abstract": "AIMS: Although intraductal carcinoma has been demonstrated in intracapsular carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CEPA), the morphological and genetic stages of transformation of pleomorphic adenoma (PA) to CEPA are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the morphology of intracapsular CEPA. METHODS AND RESULTS: The largest series of intracapsular CEPA studied was subject to immunohistochemical double-staining to detect p53 protein and cellular proliferation in different types of cell combined with mutational analysis of the p53 gene in laser-microdissected material. Intraductal carcinoma with high-grade cellular atypia and frequent accumulation of p53 protein was found in 15/19 cases. Purely intraductal carcinoma was found in eight cases. Mutation of p53 was found in 7/19 cases, of which it was found in intraductal carcinoma in 5/15 cases. CONCLUSIONS: The frequent demonstration of intraductal carcinoma indicates that this preinvasive lesion is likely to be a constant feature in the malignant transformation of PA to CEPA. It appears to be a feature of CEPA developing from both primary and recurrent PA. The combined immunohistochemical and genetic data show that 14/19 cases of CEPA and 11/15 cases with intraductal carcinoma showed genetic or morphological evidence of dysfunctional p53, indicating that this is an early event in malignant transformation",

    "Abstract": "Yondelis (Trabectedin, ET-743) is a marine anticancer agent currently in Phase II/III development in patients with advanced pretreated soft tissue sarcoma. In the present study, we generated a panel of low passaged tumor cell lines from samples explanted from chemonaive sarcoma patients with different tumor types. We assessed in vitro sensitivity/resistance to Trabectedin and doxorubicin in a panel of sarcoma cell lines and examined the correlation between molecular alterations in DNA repair genes and sensitivity to Trabectedin. We treated cell lines with Trabectedin and doxorubicin in both 96-h and clonogenic assays. In both assays, well-defined groups of resistant and sensitive cell lines were observed. Resistance to Trabectedin did not correlate with resistance to doxorubicin, indicating that the two drugs may have different mechanisms of resistance. p53 mutations and deletions correlated with extreme sensitivity (IC50 < 1 nM) to Trabectedin (P < 0.01). In a pair of isogenic cell lines differing only in the presence or absence of wild-type p53, the absence of p53 rendered cells threefold more sensitive to Trabectedin",

    "Title": "An alternative approach to determining therapeutic choices in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC): maximizing the diagnostic procedure and the use of low-volume lung biopsies",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate mutational analysis, especially epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, of diagnostic biopsies from all Asian NSCLC patients is crucial to their clinical management, but faces problems. Here, we explore, within usual hospital constraints, the practicalities of incorporating mutational analysis in every newly diagnosed case of NSCLC, namely, maximizing tissue acquisition during the diagnostic procedure and determining the maximum quantity and quality of DNA sequence data available from these biopsies. METHODS: Sixty-eight Chinese patients were enrolled. Thirty-five underwent surgical resections for early-stage tumors. Thirty-three underwent diagnostic procedures, i.e., needle aspirates under bronchoscopic or computed tomographic/fluoroscopic guidance, or forceps biopsies via bronchoscopy. Separate samples for research purposes were obtained from these 33 patients during the diagnostic procedure. All samples were analyzed for mutations in EGFR exons 18 to 21, p53 exons 4 to 9, and Kras exon 2. RESULTS: No deaths occurred in this study. Success rates in obtaining sequence data from surgical samples versus low-volume samples for EGFR, p53, and Kras were 100% versus 85%, 100% versus 82%, and 100% versus 85%, respectively. Sequencing nine polymerase chain reaction products from each low-volume sample resulted in the exhaustion of all extracted DNA from three samples. CONCLUSIONS: Acquiring a separate low-volume lung biopsy sample for mutational analysis in lung cancer patients during the diagnostic procedure is feasible and may be a valuable complement to the usual diagnostic workflow in future",

    "Title": "Functional characterization of a novel BRCA1-null ovarian cancer cell line in response to ionizing radiation",
    "Abstract": "The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 plays a major role in the DNA damage response pathway. The lack of well-characterized human BRCA1-null cell lines has limited the investigation of BRCA1 function, particularly with regard to its role in ovarian cancer. We propagated a novel BRCA1-null human ovarian cancer cell line UWB1.289 from a tumor of papillary serous histology, the most common form of ovarian carcinoma. UWB1.289 carries a germline BRCA1 mutation within exon 11 and has a deletion of the wild-type allele. UWB1.289 is estrogen and progesterone receptor negative and has an acquired somatic mutation in p53, similar to the commonly used BRCA1-null breast cancer cell line HCC1937. We used ionizing radiation to induce DNA damage in both UWB1.289 and in a stable UWB1.289 line in which wild-type BRCA1 was restored. We examined several responses to DNA damage in these cell lines, including sensitivity to radiation, cell cycle checkpoint function, and changes in gene expression using microarray analysis. We observed that UWB1.289 is sensitive to ionizing radiation and lacks cell cycle checkpoint functions that are a normal part of the DNA damage response. Restoration of wild-type BRCA1 function in these cells partially restores DNA damage responses. Expression array analysis not only supports this partial functional correction but also reveals interesting new information regarding BRCA1-positive regulation of the expression of claudin 6 and other metastasis-associated genes and negative regulation of multiple IFN-inducible genes",

    "Title": "Increased Steroidogenic Factor-1 dosage triggers adrenocortical cell proliferation and cancer",
    "Abstract": "Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF-1/Ad4BP; NR5A1), a nuclear receptor transcription factor, has a pivotal role in adrenal and gonadal development in humans and mice. A frequent feature of childhood adrenocortical tumors (ACT) is SF-1 amplification and overexpression. Here we show that an increased SF-1 dosage can by itself augment human adrenocortical cell proliferation through concerted actions on cell cycle and apoptosis. This effect is dependent on an intact SF-1 transcriptional activity. Gene expression profiling showed that an increased SF-1 dosage regulates transcripts involved in steroid metabolism, cell cycle, apoptosis and cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Consistent with these results, increased SF-1 levels selectively modulate the steroid secretion profile of adrenocortical cells, reducing cortisol and aldosterone production and maintaining DHEA-S secretion. As a model to understand the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by increased SF-1 dosage we studied FATE1, coding for a cancer-testis antigen implicated in the control of cell proliferation. Increased SF-1 levels increase its binding to a consensus site in FATE1 promoter and stimulate its activity through modulation of the recruitment of specific cofactors. On the other hand, sphingosine, which can compete with phospholipids for binding to SF-1, had no effect on SF-1 dosage-dependent increase of adrenocortical cell proliferation and expression of the FATE1 promoter. In mice, increased Sf-1 dosage produces adrenocortical hyperplasia and formation of tumors expressing gonadal markers (Amh, Gata-4), which originate from the subcapsular region of the adrenal cortex. Gene expression profiling revealed that genes involved in cell adhesion, immune response and transcription factor Stat3 are differentially expressed in Sf-1 transgenic mouse adrenals compared to wild-type adrenals. Our studies reveal a critical role for SF-1 dosage in adrenocortical tumorigenesis and constitute a rationale for the development of drugs targeting SF-1 transcriptional activity for ACT therapy",

    "Abstract": "To verify the prognostic implications of the statuses of chromosome 1p and 19q and the expressions of p53, p16 and GFAP in oligodendrogliomas, we investigated these parameters and correlated the results with patient outcome. Twenty-seven cases of low-grade oligodendroglioma (LO) and 29 cases of anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO) were analyzed by FISH for 1p and 19q status and by immunohistochemistry for p53, p16, and GFAP expression using a tissue microarray. Direct sequencing of the p53 gene was also performed. 1p deletion was observed in 39 of 56 patients (69.9%), and 19q deletion in 41 of 56 (73.2%). Combined loss of 1p and 19q was found in 38 of 56 (67.9%) and exhibited distinct concomitant deletion (P = 0.000). p53 overexpression was observed in 17 cases (30.3%), GFAP expression in 18 cases (32.1%), and p16 loss in 40 cases (74%) of oligodendrogliomas. The expressions of p53 and GFAP were more frequent in AO than in LO (P= 0.015 and 0.001). In contrast, p53 expression was more common in oligodendrogliomas with an intact 19q (P= 0.029), or an intact 1p (P= 0.071). Only five of 14 patients with p53 expression showed TP53 mutation, which was inversely correlated with 1p deletion (P= 0.036). Patients with combined loss of 1p and 19q exhibited better overall survival (P = 0.045). Patients with p53 expression without combined 1p and 19q loss showed poor overall survival (P < 0.000). However, TP53 mutation along with 1p and 19q status could not predict patient outcome. Patients with p16 loss without combined 1p and 9q loss showed poor overall survival (P = 0.011). Therefore, in oligodendrogliomas, the absence of the combined deletion of 1p and 19q and the aberrant expression of p53 or loss of p16 could be used as poor prognostic markers",

    "Title": "The possible role of cell cycle regulators in multistep process of HPV-associated cervical carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 are associated with cervical carcinogenesis through an interaction between HPV oncogenic proteins and cell cycle regulatory genes. However, the exact pathogenetic mechanisms are not determined yet. METHODS: We investigated 43 invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ISCC), 38 CIN III, 11 CINII and 18 CINI for cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK4, p53, mdm-2, p21(waf), p27, p16(INK4A), Rb and Ki-67 aberrations using immunohistochemistry and molecular techniques. Twenty samples of normal cervical tissues (NCT) were taken as a control. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the expression of Ki-67, cyclin E, CDK4, p16(INK4A), Rb (p= 0.003, 0.001, 0.001, 0.01) and a significant decrease in p27(KIP1) from NCT to ISCC (p = 0.003). Increased cyclin D1, p21(waf), p53, mdm-2 expression, homozygous deletion (HZD) and promoter methylation (PM) of the Rb were detected in CINIII and ISCC only. On univariate analysis; tumor size, differentiation, lymph node status, FIGO stage, Ki-67, cyclin D1, p53 and p27(KIP1) are significantly associated with reduced overall survival (OS) while on multivariate analysis; only FIGO stage, Ki-67, cyclin D1, p53 and p27(KIP1) were significant. CONCLUSION: 1) Aberrations involving p27(KIP1), cyclin E, CDK4, p16(INK4A) are considered early events in HPV 16 and 18-associated cervical carcinoma, whereas cyclin D1 and p53 pathway abnormalities are considered late events. 2) Immunohistochemical tests for p16(INK4A) and cyclin E, could help in early diagnosis of cervical carcinoma. 3) Only FIGO stage p53, cyclin D1, p27(KIP1) and Ki-67 are independent prognostic factors that might help in predicting outcome of cervical cancer patients",

    "Title": "Somatic TP53 mutations are relatively rare among adrenocortical cancers with the frequent 17p13 loss of heterozygosity",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Allelic losses [loss of heterozygosity (LOH)] at the 17p13 locus are frequent (85%) in adrenocortical cancers. The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is located at 17p13. The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of TP53 somatic inactivating mutations in adrenocortical tumors with 17p13 LOH and their clinico-biological correlations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TP53 somatic mutations, intragenic LOH (VNTR1 marker), and p53 overexpression were studied in 36 adrenocortical tumors with 17p13 LOH determined by Southern blot. RESULTS: TP53 mutations were detected in 33% of the tumors, and VNTR1 LOH was present in 44% of the cases and did not always correlate with the presence of a TP53 mutation. Only the TP53-mutant tumors exhibit a strong nuclear immunoreactivity. TP53-mutant tumors were significantly larger than wild-type TP53 tumors (median tumor weight: 640 versus 185 g; P=0.02), were associated with a more advanced stage of tumor progression (MacFarlane stage IV; P=0.01), and had a shorter disease-free survival (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The finding that only a minority of adrenocortical tumors with 17p13 LOH had either a VNTR1 LOH or a TP53 mutation indicates that TP53 might not be the only or major tumor suppressor gene at 17p13 involved in adrenocortical cancer progression. We suggest that a genetic instability of the 17p13 region, occurring early in adrenocortical cancer development, involves various genes located in this region. TP53 might be only one of them, and its alteration by the occurrence of inactivating mutation is associated with the development of more aggressive tumors",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the nature and potential pharmacologic reversibility of deficient TP53 expression and function in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with wild-type TP53, previously associated with decreased sensitivity to cisplatin therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TP53 genotype, mRNA and protein expression, TP53-induced p21 expression, and TP53 DNA-binding and reporter gene function were determined in a panel of nine previously characterized HNSCC cell lines from the University of Michigan squamous cell carcinoma (UM-SCC) series. The genotoxic drug doxorubicin and the anti-inflammatory and antimalarial drug quinacrine, previously identified as inducers of TP53, were used to examine the nature and potential reversibility of deficient TP53 expression and function. The specific role of inducible TP53 on function and cellular proliferation was confirmed using selective TP53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha or short hairpin RNA knockdown. The capability of quinacrine to sensitize HNSCC to the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin was assessed. RESULTS: UM-SCC cell lines with wild-type TP53 genotype underexpressed TP53 mRNA and protein when compared with normal human keratinocytes or UM-SCC with mutant TP53. Although doxorubicin failed to induce TP53 expression or functional activity, quinacrine induced TP53 mRNA and protein expression, increased TP53 reporter activity and p21 protein expression, and induced growth inhibition in these wild-type TP53 cell lines. Quinacrine-induced TP53 reporter activity and growth suppression were attenuated by pifithrin-alpha and TP53 short hairpin RNA knockdown. Furthermore, quinacrine sensitized UM-SCC to cisplatin in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Deficient TP53 mRNA and protein expression underlies decreased function in a subset of HNSCC with wild-type TP53 and can be restored together with cisplatin sensitization by quinacrine",

    "Title": "p53 mutations in deep tissues are more strongly associated with recurrence than mutation-positive mucosal margins",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Application of ultrasensitive diagnostics has shown that small numbers of p53 mutation-positive cells may signify the presence of residual tumor in histologically normal tissues after resection of squamous cell carcinomas arising in the head and neck area. To date, most studies in this area have focused on analysis of tissues at the mucosal aspect of the resection and highlighted the importance of molecular changes in the field with respect to the risk of recurrence. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In the present investigation, we analyzed normal tissues from mucosal and deep surgical margins, referred to as 'molecular margins,' for the presence of the signature p53 mutation identified for each tumor. RESULTS: The p53 mutation status of these carcinomas did not correlate with clinical or histopathologic variables, but these mutations provided an excellent target for ultrasensitive analysis of margin status. We found that 11 of 16 (68%) of cases with histologically tumor-free (including 9 without dysplasia), but with p53 mutation-positive molecular margins, developed recurrence. The probability of developing local recurrence was significantly higher for the group with p53 mutation-positive margins when compared with the group with clear margins (P = 0.048) and more strongly associated with p53 mutation-positive deep molecular margins than mutation-positive mucosal molecular margins or positivity at both sites (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: This shows that although persistent mucosal fields may contribute to recurrence, clonal p53 mutations in deep tissues are an important cause of treatment failure, and molecular margins from both sites should be analyzed in future prospective series",

    "Title": "Comprehensive analysis of copy number and allele status identifies multiple chromosome defects underlying follicular lymphoma pathogenesis",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Follicular lymphoma (FL) constitutes the second most common non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the Western world. The clinical course is variable and only in part explained by known tumor-intrinsic or -extrinsic factors. FL carries the hallmark chromosomal translocation t(14;18), deregulating the expression of Bcl-2, but this is not sufficient to explain either FL biology or clinical behavior. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have employed high-density genomic profiling technology using the Affymetrix 50K-XbaI oligonucleotide single nucleotide polymorphism-chip platform to interrogate the genomes of 58 fluorescence-activated cell-sorted (FACS) FL specimens for chromosomal copy number changes and 46 specimens for loss of heterozygosity (LOH). RESULTS: We report (a) previously unknown high-frequency copy-neutral LOH (uniparental disomy) in FL on chromosomes 1p (approximately 50%) and 6p (approximately 30%); (b) that del6q is complex, as reported, with at least two regions of minimal common loss at 6q13-15 and 6q23-24, and that in addition, approximately 8% of FL specimens contain a homozygous deletion at 6q23.3-24.1 that spans the negative NFkappaB regulator A20 and the p53 apoptosis effector PERP; (c) that combined analysis of chromosome 17p for LOH, copy number, and p53 mutations shows that most p53 mutations in FL do not involve del17p. Finally, we map high-frequency LOH with and without copy loss on chromosomes 9p, 10q, and 16p and genomic gains on 2p15-16 and 8q24.22-24.3. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive description of the pathologic anatomy of the FL genome uncovers novel genetic lesions and should aid with identification of genes relevant to FL biology and clinical behavior",

    "Title": "Intraepithelial carcinoma of the fimbria and pelvic serous carcinoma: Evidence for a causal relationship",
    "Abstract": "Proposed origins of pelvic serous carcinoma include the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum. Prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomies in BRCA+ women have recently identified the fimbria as a site of origin for early serous carcinoma (tubal intraepithelial carcinoma or TIC). We explored the relationship of TIC to pelvic serous carcinomas in consecutive cases with complete adnexal exam (SEE-FIM protocol). Cases positive (group A) or negative (group B) for endosalpinx (including fimbria) involvement, were subclassified as tubal, ovarian, or primary peritoneal in origin. Coexisting TIC was recorded in group A when present and p53 mutation status was determined in 5 cases. Of 55 evaluable cases, 41 (75%) were in group A; including tubal (n = 5), peritoneal (n = 6), and ovarian (n = 30) carcinomas. Foci of TIC were identified in 5 of 5, 4 of 6, and 20 of 30, respectively. Ninety-three percent of TICs involved the fimbriae. Five of 5 TICs and concurrent ovarian carcinomas contained identical p53 mutations. Thirteen of 14 cases in group B were classified as primary ovarian carcinomas, 10 with features supporting an origin in the ovary. Overall, 71% and 48% of 'ovarian' serous carcinomas had endosalpinx involvement or TIC. TIC coexists with all forms of pelvic serous carcinoma and is a plausible origin for many of these tumors. Further studies are needed to elucidate the etiologic significance of TIC in pelvic serous carcinoma, reevaluate the criteria for tubal, peritoneal, and ovarian serous carcinoma, and define the role of the distal tube in pelvic serous carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Lack of p53 augments thymoquinone-induced apoptosis and caspase activation in human osteosarcoma cells",
    "Abstract": "We have recently shown that thymoquinone (TQ) is an antineoplastic drug that induces p53-dependent apoptosis in human colon cancer cells. This study evaluated the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of TQ in two human osteosarcoma cell lines with different p53 mutation status. TQ decreased cell survival dose-dependently and, more significantly, in p53-null MG63 cells (IC(50) = 17 muM) than in p53-mutant MNNG/HOS cells (IC(50) = 38 muM). Cell viability was reduced more selectively in MG63 tumor cells than in normal human osteoblasts. Flow cytometric analysis showed that TQ induced a much greater increase in the PreG(1) (apoptotic) cell population, but no cell cycle arrest in MG63. G(2)/M arrest in MNNG/HOS cells was associated with p21(WAF1) upregulation. Using three DNA damage assays, TQ was confirmed to result in a significantly greater extent of apoptosis in p53 null MG63 cells. Although the Bax/Bcl-2 ratios were not differentially modulated in both cell lines, the mitochondrial pathway appeared to be involved in TQ-induced apoptosis in MG63 by showing the cleavage of caspases-9 and -3. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial O(2)(*-) generation in isolated rat mitochondria were enhanced by TQ as measured by the dose-dependent reduction in aconitase enzyme activity and Amplex Red oxidation respectively. TQ-induced oxidative damage, reflected by an increase in gamma-H2AX foci and increased protein expression levels of gamma-H2AX and the DNA repair enzyme, NBS1, was more pronounced in MNNG/HOS than in MG63. We suggest that the resistance of MNNG/HOS cells to drug-induced apoptosis is caused by the up-regulation of p21(WAF1) by the mutant p53 (transcriptional activity was shown by p53 siRNA treatment) which induces cell cycle arrest and allows to repair DNA damage. Collectively, these findings show that TQ induces p53-independent apoptosis in human osteosarcoma cells. As the loss of p53 function is frequently observed in osteosarcoma patients, our data suggest the potential clinical usefulness of TQ for the treatment of these malignancies",

    "Title": "The radiation-induced cell-death signaling pathway is activated by concurrent use of cisplatin in sequential biopsy specimens from patients with cervical cancer",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify changes in gene expression related to the concurrent use of platinum compounds with radiotherapy, in the treatment of cervical cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Biopsy specimens were obtained from 39 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix, before and during fractionated radiotherapy. Twenty patients were treated with radiotherapy (RT) alone, while 19 received the same radiotherapy plus concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin (CRT). Changes in gene expression induced by treatment were investigated using single-color oligo-microarrays consisting of 44K human sequences. Paraffin-embedded samples were used to examine apoptosis and the expression of protein by treatment-responsive genes. Changes in mRNA expression were assessed for these genes by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Aberrant genomic change (detected using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization), human papillomavirus infection, and p53 status were also evaluated. RESULTS: The expression of CDKN1A, BAX, TNFSF8, and RRM2B was consistently upregulated by CRT (9 Gy with a single administration of cisplatin). Similar expression changes were induced by RT (9 Gy) alone, although the variability between tumors was greater. Apoptotic cells were significantly increased in both groups. CRT significantly increased the numbers of cases with diffusely distributed CDKN1A-positive cells. Genetic losses at 2q33-ter and gains of 3q26-ter were detected in the samples with high frequency; 60% were positive for human papillomavirus DNA; and three tumors had deletions/mutations of the p53 gene. There was no difference in the incidence of these genomic changes between the groups, and no association was found with the changes in expression of CDKN1A, BAX, TNFSF8 or RRM2B. CONCLUSIONS: Using biopsy samples from pretreatment and midtreatment cervical tumors, we identified therapy-induced genes related to the cell death signaling pathway. CRT produced a homogenous pattern of changes in expression of known radiation-responsive genes",

    "Title": "Neuroendocrine tumor metastasis to the thyroid gland",
    "Abstract": "It has been reported that the thyroid is relatively immune to malignant metastasis. Therefore, in a practical setting, it is difficult to diagnose whether synchronous nodules in both lung and thyroid are independent or have metastasized from one to the other. In the present study, we report a treatment approach in a patient with such nodules, using a molecular technique. A 68-year-old woman presented with synchronous solitary thyroid mass and a nodular lesion in the right lung. Both tumors, which were surgically resected, morphologically showed neuroendocrine differentiation, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. These features required differential diagnosis from possible (1) medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with metastasis to the lung, (2) pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma with metastasis to the thyroid, and (3) independent MTC and pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma. Identical mutations of the p53 gene were detected in both the thyroid and lung tumors, indicating the same origin for both tumors. In addition, these mutations and a lack of calcitonin expression suggested a pulmonary origin of the tumors. Metastatic thyroid cancers are well known to cause miliary lesions in the lung, while lung cancers can metastasize to various tissues. Furthermore, pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma has been reported as having a tendency of metastasizing to the thyroid. Head and neck surgeons should be aware that a particular subset of lung cancers may develop a metastatic solitary nodule in the thyroid, as presented. An effective therapeutic strategy is largely dependent on the differential diagnosis",

    "Title": "A novel loss-of-function mutation in TP53 in an endometrial cancer cell line and uterine papillary serous carcinoma model",
    "Abstract": "The etiology of carcinoma of the uterine endometrium (ECa) is poorly understood. However, loss of apoptosis is one of the major factors that allow cancer cells to survive and progress. Hec50co, a poorly differentiated human ECa cell line, is widely used in the investigation of ECa. Previously, Hec50co xenograft tumor model in nude mice developed an advanced phenotype, similar to that of uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC). Importantly, loss-of-function mutation in tumor suppressor TP53 was found in 20-30% of all ECa and >90% of UPSC. Thus, understanding the status of TP53 in Hec50co is essential for using Heco50co as a model for UPSC. To obtain an accurate genotype-phenotype status of TP53 in Hec50co, we performed mutation and functional analysis of TP53 gene of Hec50co by RT-PCR, genomic-PCR, and cloning and expression of mutant and wildtype TP53 alleles. We found a novel 42-bp deletion mutation in the exon6-intron6 splice junction of TP53 (TP53.del42bp) leading to a 113-bp exon6-deleted/skipped transcript was identified in Hec50co. In addition, the other TP53 allele in Hec50co is inactivated through a large deletion. Adenovirus (AD) harboring wildtype full-length TP53 cDNA induces caspase-dependent apoptosis; while the AD-TP53.del42bp allele does not. In addition, messenger RNA of TP53.del42bp allele is stable whereas the protein product of TP53.del42bp allele is made but not stable. Taken together, we demonstrate that Hec50co is a TP53-null cell line possessing one TP53.del42bp allele and the other lost allele and therefore provides an excellent model to dissect the molecular and cellular bases of UPSC and other p53-null cancers",

    "Title": "TP53 mutation status and gene expression profiles are powerful prognostic markers of breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gene expression profiling of breast carcinomas has increased our understanding of the heterogeneous biology of this disease and promises to impact clinical care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of gene expression-based classification along with established prognostic markers and mutation status of the TP53 gene (tumour protein p53) in a group of breast cancer patients with long-term (12 to 16 years) follow-up. METHODS: The clinical and histopathological parameters of 200 breast cancer patients were studied for their effects on clinical outcome using univariate/multivariate Cox regression. The prognostic impact of mutations in the TP53 gene, identified using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing, was also evaluated. Eighty of the samples were analyzed for gene expression using 42 K cDNA microarrays and the patients were assigned to five previously defined molecular expression groups. The strength of the gene expression based classification versus standard markers was evaluated by adding this variable to the Cox regression model used to analyze all samples. RESULTS: Both univariate and multivariate analysis showed that TP53 mutation status, tumor size and lymph node status were the strongest predictors of breast cancer survival for the whole group of patients. Analyses of the patients with gene expression data showed that TP53 mutation status, gene expression based classification, tumor size and lymph node status were significant predictors of survival. Breast cancer cases in the 'basal-like' and 'ERBB2+' gene expression subgroups had a very high mortality the first two years, while the 'highly proliferating luminal' cases developed the disease more slowly, showing highest mortality after 5 to 8 years. The TP53 mutation status showed strong association with the 'basal-like' and 'ERBB2+' subgroups, and tumors with mutation had a characteristic gene expression pattern. CONCLUSION: TP53 mutation status and gene-expression based groups are important survival markers of breast cancer, and these molecular markers may provide prognostic information that complements clinical variables. The study adds experience and knowledge to an ongoing characterization and classification of the disease",

    "Title": "Identification of typical medullary breast carcinoma as a genomic sub-group of basal-like carcinomas, a heterogeneous new molecular entity",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Typical medullary breast carcinoma (MBC) has recently been recognized to be part of the basal-like carcinoma spectrum, a feature in agreement with the high rate of TP53 mutations previously reported in MBCs. The present study was therefore designed to identify phenotypic and genetic alterations that distinguish MBCs from basal-like carcinomas (BLC). METHODS: Expression levels of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), ERBB2, TP53, cytokeratins (KRTs) 5/6, 14, 8/18, epidermal growth factor receptor and KIT, as well as TP53 gene sequence and high-density array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) profiles, were assessed and compared in a series of 33 MBCs and 26 BLCs. RESULTS: All tumors were negative for ER, PR and ERBB2. KRTs 5/6 were more frequently expressed in MBCs (94%) than in BLCs (56%) (p = 0.0004). TP53 mutations were disclosed in 20/26 MBCs (77%) and 20/24 BLCs (83%). Array CGH analysis showed that a higher number of gains (95 regions) and losses (34 regions) was observed in MBCs than in BLCs (36 regions of gain; 13 regions of losses). In addition, gains of 1q and 8q, and losses of X were found to be common to the two groups, whereas gains of 10p (53% of the cases), 9p (30.8% of the cases) and 16q (25.8% of the cases), and losses of 4p (34.8% of the cases), and amplicons of 1q, 8p, 10p and 12p were the genetic alterations found to characterize MBC. CONCLUSION: Our study has revealed that MBCs are part of the basal-like group and share common genomic alterations with BLCs, the most frequent being 1q and 8q gains and X losses; however, MBCs are a distinct entity within the basal-like spectrum, characterized by a higher rate of KRT 5/6 expression, a higher rate of gains and losses than BLCs, recurrent 10p, 9p and 16q gains, 4p losses, and 1q, 8p, 10p and 12p amplicons. Our results thus contribute to a better understanding of the heterogeneity in basal-like breast tumors and provide potential diagnostic tools",

    "Title": "Establishment and characterization of cell lines from three human thyroid carcinomas: responses to all-trans-retinoic acid and mutations in the BRAF gene",
    "Abstract": "We report the characteristics of three cell lines (designated, SNU-80, SNU-373 and SNU-790), which were established from two papillary carcinomas and one anaplastic carcinoma obtained from three Korean thyroid carcinoma patients. All cell lines grow as adherent cells. Electron microscopy characteristically showed cytoplasmic invaginations of nuclei and intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions. SNU-80 and SNU-790 cells showed a positive reaction to anti-cytokeratin antibody, and SNU-790 cells positivity for CK-19. All lines were free of mycoplasma or bacteria and were proven unique by DNA fingerprinting analysis. The p15 and p16 genes are deleted in the SNU-790 line. Mutations of the p53 gene were found in two lines (SNU-80 and SNU-373), but no mutations in the RET or MEN1 genes were observed. Mutations of the BRAF gene were found in the SNU-80 (G468R) and the SNU-790 (V599E) cell lines, but no mutations in the K-ras gene were present. SNU-80 and SNU-790 cells showed a positive reaction to anti-cytokeratin antibody, and no evidence of the production of thyroglobulin or calcitonin was observed. The cell lines were unable to trap radioactive iodine but did not contain TSH receptor. In addition, we investigated the mRNA expression levels of Tg, TSHR, TTF-1, PAX-8, NIS, IL-6, and LIF, and of the alpha, beta and gamma retinoic acid receptors in these cell lines. IL-6 was down-regulated in all three cell lines by all-trans-retinoic acid treatment. RAR-alpha was expressed but RAR-beta was not expressed in the three cell lines, and RAR-gamma was not expressed in SNU-790. Interestingly, RAR-beta (SNU-80 and SNU-373) and RAR-gamma (SNU-790) was up-regulated by all-trans-retinoic acid treatment. We believe that these well-characterized thyroid carcinoma cell lines may be useful tools for investigations on the biological characteristics of thyroid carcinoma, particularly for investigations related to gene alterations, especially of the BRAF gene. These cell lines may also be useful for redifferentiation therapy studies on thyroid carcinoma using all-trans-retinoic acid",

We examined 7 cases of solitary ovarian endometriosis, 13 cases of OCCA, and 9 cases of OEC. Cancer tissue specimens that also contained endometriosis without atypia were chosen. Using a laser microdissection system, epithelial cells from the areas of endometriosis were isolated, and DNA was extracted. We amplified exons 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the p53 gene, and direct sequencing was performed. p53 mutation was observed in 4 (30.8%) of 13 specimens of endometriosis coexisting with OCCA, whereas no mutations were detected in solitary endometriosis or endometriosis coexisting with OEC. We thought that some genetic alterations, which induce p53 mutations in endometriosis, may affect malignant transformation of endometriosis into OCCA",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish a routine procedure for the detection of p53 mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surgical resections using the FASAY (functional analysis of separated alleles of p53 on yeast) procedure. METHODS: p53 status was analyzed by FASAY and cDNA sequencing in 50 cases of HCC. After the extraction of RNA from the frozen tumor and corresponding normal tissues, reverse transcription RT-PCR was carried out using these samples. The assay can detect mutations of p53 mRNA between codons 67 and 347 by the DNA-binding activity of the protein and reveal them as red colonies. RESULTS: Of the 50 specimens, 29 (58%) were positive (mutant) by FASAY. Sequencing analysis confirmed that all 29 FASAY positive tumors harbored mutations, and that no mutations were detectable in any FASAY negative tumors. In 29 p53 mutations, 22 mutations were point missense mutation, 5 were deletions and 2 were splicing mutations. A novel splice mutation on splice donor of intron 6 was reported, which could produce two different mRNAs, respectively using the nearest upstream and downstream recessive splice donor sites. CONCLUSION: FASAY is a sensitive method for detecting the various types of p53 mutations in HCC, suggesting that the yeast functional assay for the detection of p53 mutations may be essential for elucidating their clinical significance",

    "Title": "Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses of giant cell glioblastoma multiforme reveal distinct profiles in giant cell and non-giant cell subpopulations",
    "Abstract": "We have comparatively analyzed mechanisms associated with chromosomal and microsatellite instability in giant cell glioblastoma multiforme (gcGBM) and classic GBM. This included microsatellite instability (MSI), loss of expression of four major mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, aberrations of five chromosomes, EGFR copy number, and TP53 mutations. MSI was more frequent among gcGBM (30 vs. 7.8%, P = 0.054). TP53 mutations were more commonly observed in gcGBM (83.3%), whereas EGFR was amplified in just one gcGBM (8.3%). By tumor cell phenotype-specific cytogenetic analysis of gcGBM, increased chromosome copy numbers were identified in 72-84% of giant cells but in only 4-14% of nongiant cells; in classic GBM, intermediate frequencies were noted (11-49%). Chromosome 10 deletions were found in nongiant cells of all gcGBM cases but in only approximately 45% of the cell population in classic GBM. The present study shows a distinct pattern of cytogenetic alterations in nongiant and giant cell phenotypes in gcGBM and suggests that multinuclear giant cells evolve from nongiant tumor cells at an early tumor stage. Furthermore, the data point to differences in the profile of chromosomal and microsatellite instability in gcGBM and classic GBM that might underscore the distinct pathological features of both tumor subtypes",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Genetic abnormalities of the p53 gene may play a major role in the carcinogenesis of gastric stump carcinomas (GSC) and intestinal-type primary gastric carcinomas (IPGC). Also, they may modulate P-gp expression producing chemoresistance. The aim of this article is to analyze p53 genetic abnormalities and the influence of p53 gene status on P-gp expression in both types of carcinomas. METHODOLOGY: Forty-two paraffin-embedded samples of gastric carcinomas corresponding to 17 GSC and 25 IPGC were studied. P53 genetic abnormalities in exon 5-9 were screened by direct sequencing of PCR products. P53 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) were assessed by a standard streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method. Anti-p53 DO7 and anti-P-gp C494 were used as primary antibodies. RESULTS: Fourteen p53 mutations were found, 5 in GSC (29%) and 9 in IPGC (36%). Thirteen mutations were base-pair substitutions that produced a change in the amino acid sequence. Eight mutations were located at exon 7 (57%). P53 nuclear immunopositivity was observed in 12 GSC (71%) and 15 IPGC (60%). Only two carcinomas (1 IPGC and 1 GSC) harboring a p53 mutation did not show any p53 expression. All except one of the gastric carcinomas having a p53 mutation showed medium or high P-gp expression. However, there was no difference in P-gp expression between tumors with and without p53 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The p53 genetic alterations found in GSC and IPGC could originate from a similar pathogenetic pathway. No association was demonstrated between p53 gene status and P-gp expression, although most of the carcinomas harboring a p53 mutation showed medium or high P-gp expression",

    "Title": "Possible involvement of CCT5, RGS3, and YKT6 genes up-regulated in p53-mutated tumors in resistance to docetaxel in human breast cancers",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Present study was aimed to investigate the relationship of p53 mutation status with response to docetaxel in breast cancers. In addition, attempts were made to identify the genes differentially expressed between p53-wild and p53-mutated breast tumors and to study their relationship with response to docetaxel. METHODS: Mutational analysis of p53 was done in 50 breast tumor samples obtained from primary breast cancer patients (n = 33) and locally recurrent breast cancer patients (n = 17) before docetaxel therapy. Response to docetaxel was evaluated clinically. Gene expression profiling (n = 2,412) was conducted by adapter-tagged competitive-PCR in 186 tumor samples, which were also analyzed in their p53 mutational status in order to identify the differentially expressed genes according to p53 mutation status and their relationship with response to docetaxel. RESULTS: Response rate of p53-mutated tumors (44%) was lower than that of p53-wild tumors (62%) though there was no statistical significance (P = 0.23). Of 2412 genes, mRNA expression of 13 genes was significantly different between p53-wild and p53-mutated tumors. Of these 13 genes, mRNA expression of CCT5, RGS3, and YKT6 was significantly up-regulated in p53-mutated tumors and associated with a low response rate to docetaxel. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with siRNA specific for CCT5, RGS3, or YKT6 resulted in a significant enhancement of docetaxel-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: CCT5, RGS3, and YKT6 mRNA expressions, which are up-regulated in p53-mutated breast tumors, might be implicated in resistance to docetaxel and clinically useful in identifying the subset of breast cancer patients who may or may not benefit from docetaxel treatment",

    "Title": "Genetically distinct astrocytic and oligodendroglial components in oligoastrocytomas",
    "Abstract": "Oligoastrocytomas are glial tumours consisting of a mixture of neoplastic astrocytic and oligodendroglial cells. Genetic alterations of oligoastrocytomas include loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p and/or 19q (LOH 1p/19q), typically occurring in oligodendrogliomas, and mutations of TP53, frequently occurring in astrocytomas. To investigate whether these neoplastic cell types in oligoastrocytomas have different genetic profiles, we examined the two different components of oligoastrocytomas in comparison with the histological diagnosis of the specific tumour area for LOH 1p/19q and TP53 mutations by using microdissection technique. We found a variety of lost markers for 1p and 19q, and the presence of two different TP53 mutations in the tumour samples. In the majority of cases (9/11), the oligodendroglial and astrocytic components of an individual oligoastrocytoma displayed the same genotype. We present two cases of biphasic oligoastrocytomas with aberrant findings, suggesting the coexistence of genetically and morphologically distinct tumour cell clones in these tumours. In one case, the oligodendroglial part of the tumour showed LOH19q, whereas the astrocytic part showed TP53 mutation (codon 273). In another case, we found LOH 1p/19q in the oligodendroglial component, but two retained areas on chromosome 1p in the astrocytic component of the tumour. No evidence was found for the coexistence of tumour cells with the two genotypical changes within the same morphological region of one individual tumour. The two cases of biphasic oligoastrocytomas in our sample that display a different genotype in the astrocytic and oligodendroglial part of the tumour show that different components of an oligoastrocytoma may be derived from different cell clones during neoplastic transformation",

    "Abstract": "The importance of somatic TP53 mutations and germline TP53 codon 72 genotype in the survival of women with epithelial ovarian cancer is controversial. Recent data suggest that a promoter polymorphism in the MDM2 gene may influence age of cancer onset in a gender-specific fashion. We sought to determine the relationship between somatic TP53 mutations, germline genotypes at TP53 codon 72 and MDM2 SNP309, and overall survival and response to chemotherapy in a large series of patients with ovarian and peritoneal carcinomas. Of the 188 cancers, 103 (54.8%) had a TP53 mutation, of which 71% were missense mutations and 29% were null mutations. TP53 mutation status and mutation type (null vs. missense) did not influence response to therapy or overall survival. Women with the codon 72 Pro/Pro had a decreased overall survival (median, 29 months) compared with women with one or two arginine alleles (median, 49 months; P=0.04). Somatic mutation or deletion was equally common for either codon 72 allele. Age of diagnosis was not influenced by codon 72 but showed a trend for younger age in women with somatic TP53 mutations and the MDM2 G/G genotype",

    "Title": "Molecular genetic analysis of p53 intratumoral heterogeneity in human astrocytic brain tumors",
    "Abstract": "We investigated genetic heterogeneity of astrocytic gliomas using p53 gene mutations as a marker. Different parts of morphologically heterogeneous astrocytic gliomas were microdissected, and direct DNA sequencing of p53 gene exons 5 through 8 was performed. Thirty-five glioma samples and tumor-adjacent normal-appearing brain tissue from 11 patients were analyzed. Sixteen different p53 gene mutations were found in 7 patients. We found that some tumors were devoid of p53 gene mutations, whereas other tumors carried 1 or often several (up to 3) different mutations. The mutations were present in grade II, III, and IV astrocytic glioma areas. Both severe functionally dead mutants and mutants with remaining transcriptional activity could be observed in the same tumor. We observed that morphologically different parts of a glioma could carry different or similar mutations in the p53 gene and could be either associated or not associated with the locus of heterozygosity at the mutant site. Coexistence of p53 gene mutations and the locus of heterozygosity was common, at least in astrocytomas grade III and in glioblastomas, and also occurred in astrocytoma grade II areas. These results support the notion that intratumoral heterogeneity in brain tumors originates from different molecular defects. Our results are of importance for a further understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind failure to treat glioma patients",

    "Title": "Aristolochic acid and the etiology of endemic (Balkan) nephropathy",
    "Abstract": "Endemic (Balkan) nephropathy (EN), a devastating renal disease affecting men and women living in rural areas of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and Serbia, is characterized by its insidious onset, invariable progression to chronic renal failure and a strong association with transitional cell (urothelial) carcinoma of the upper urinary tract. Significant epidemiologic features of EN include its focal occurrence in certain villages and a familial, but not inherited, pattern of disease. Our experiments test the hypothesis that chronic dietary poisoning by aristolochic acid is responsible for EN and its associated urothelial cancer. Using (32)P-postlabeling/PAGE and authentic standards, we identified dA-aristolactam (AL) and dG-AL DNA adducts in the renal cortex of patients with EN but not in patients with other chronic renal diseases. In addition, urothelial cancer tissue was obtained from residents of endemic villages with upper urinary tract malignancies. The AmpliChip p53 microarray was then used to sequence exons 2-11 of the p53 gene where we identified 19 base substitutions. Mutations at A:T pairs accounted for 89% of all p53 mutations, with 78% of these being A:T --> T:A transversions. Our experimental results, namely, that (i) DNA adducts derived from aristolochic acid (AA) are present in renal tissues of patients with documented EN, (ii) these adducts can be detected in transitional cell cancers, and (iii) A:T --> T:A transversions dominate the p53 mutational spectrum in the upper urinary tract malignancies found in this population lead to the conclusion that dietary exposure to AA is a significant risk factor for EN and its attendant transitional cell cancer",

    "Title": "Frequency and phenotypic implications of mitochondrial DNA mutations in human squamous cell cancers of the head and neck",
    "Abstract": "Mitochondrial genomic mutations are found in a variety of human cancers; however, the frequency of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in coding regions remains poorly defined, and the functional effects of mitochondrial mutations found in primary human cancers are not well described. Using MitoChip, we sequenced the whole mitochondrial genome in 83 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Forty-one of 83 (49%) tumors contained mtDNA mutations. Mutations occurred within noncoding (D-loop) and coding regions. A nonrandom distribution of mutations was found throughout the mitochondrial enzyme complex components. Sequencing of margins with dysplasia demonstrated an identical nonconservative mitochondrial mutation (A76T in ND4L) as the tumor, suggesting a role of mtDNA mutation in tumor progression. Analysis of p53 status showed that mtDNA mutations correlated positively with p53 mutations (P < 0.002). To characterize biological function of the mtDNA mutations, we cloned NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) mutants based on primary tumor mutations. Expression of the nuclear-transcribed, mitochondrial-targeted ND2 mutants resulted in increased anchorage-dependent and -independent growth, which was accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species production and an aerobic glycolytic metabolic phenotype with hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha induction that is reversible by ascorbate. Cancer-specific mitochondrial mutations may contribute to development of a malignant phenotype by direct genotoxic effects from increased reactive oxygen species production as well as induction of aerobic glycolysis and growth promotion",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Genetic alterations of p53, K-ras and DCC genes have a pivotal role in the colorectal cancer progression. The aim of this study was to clarify the association between K-ras mutations, p53 aberrations and DCC loss of heterozygosity (LOH), with the patient outcome and tumor characteristics in 43 stage I-II colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: Mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene and codon 12 and/or 13 of the K-ras gene were assayed by PCR-SSCP and then confirmed by DNA sequencing. DCC LOH was studied by PCR-RFLP, while p53 immunohistochemistry was also made. RESULTS: Mutations of the p53 gene were found in 14 (32.5%) tumors. Five (12%) cases showed mutation of the K-ras gene. Nuclear staining of p53 was found in 22 (51 %) cases. DCC LOH was found in 5 (12%) cases. Cases with guanine to thymine substitution that occurred in K-ras codon 12 and DCC LOH were found to be more aggressive than other cases with codon 12 mutations or DCC wild-type phenotype. Many tumors with p53 over-expression were localized on the left side of the colon (p=0.005). The stage of the tumor was higher in patients who died during the follow-up period, when compared to the ones who have survived. CONCLUSIONS: Although none of these genetic alterations showed a significant prognostic value, specific mutation of K-ras gene and DCC LOH phenotype might have a predictive prognostic implication in colorectal cancer. Furthermore, different etiopathogenetic mechanisms might be involved in the tumorigenesis of the left and right colon",

    "Abstract": "The basic molecular mechanisms regulating prostate cancer (PCA) development and progression are very poorly understood. Different tumor suppressor genes are implicated in PCA. In particular, since the mutation rate of the p53 gene is also low, researchers have speculated that an infectious agent might play an important role in PCA. Polyomaviruses are candidates for this agent. We selected a patient with a diagnosis of PCA and underwent radical prostatectomy, to investigate the presence of polyomavirus BK (BKV) sequences (urine and neoplastic tissues) and the mutation pattern of p53 gene. The results obtained showed the presence of BKV DNA and of p53 gene mutations in exons 6, 8 and 9. We speculate that BKV might contribute to cellular transformation process, triggered possibly by p53 gene mutations",

    "Title": "Frequency of TP53 mutations in relation to Arg72Pro genotypes in non small cell lung cancer",
    "Abstract": "Mutations in the TP53 gene are important events during human lung carcinogenesis. The TP53 gene harbors several polymorphisms, and functional studies have shown that the Arg72Pro polymorphism alters both wild-type and mutant p53 protein activity. Thus, we hypothesized that certain Arg72Pro genotypes may influence the frequency and pattern of somatic mutations in TP53. We therefore examined the status of the Arg72Pro polymorphism and TP53 mutations in 260 non-small-cell lung cancer cases. Here we report a significant trend toward lower frequency of TP53 mutations with increasing number of Pro72 alleles (P = 0.02). Overall, Pro72 allele carriers had significantly lower frequency of TP53 mutations compared with Arg72 homozygotes (P = 0.02). In addition, carriage of the Pro72 variant was related to a lower frequency of mutations affecting the hotspot codon 273. Mutations at codon 273 accounted for 10.6% of the mutations in Arg72 homozygotes and 1.7% of the mutations in Pro72 allele carriers. Our results suggest that the genotype of the Arg72Pro polymorphism may modulate the frequency of TP53 mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between p53 gene intron 7 polymorphism and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: One hundred and five patients with NSCLC and 100 controls were selected with case-control analysis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Apa I restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoretic separation were used to identify genotypes of p53 intron 7 in peripheral blood. Then, NSCLC biopsy tissues (n=64) and NSCLC paraffin-embedded tissues (n=40) were selected for mutation analysis. PCR products of p53 exons 5-8 were sequenced on an automated sequencer following the identification of intron 7 genotypes as previously described. RESULTS: In NSCLC patients, the homozygote positive for ApaI site in p53 intron 7 was 23.8%, the homozygote negative was 12.34%, and the heterozygote was 63.8%. Whereas in control group, the homozygote positive, the homozygote negative and the heterozygote were 44.0%, 11.0% and 45.0%, respectively (P<0.01). In the second part, mutation rate of p53 exons 5-8 was 20.0%, 50.0% and 52.9% in samples with ApaI positive, negative and heterozygotes, respectively (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: p53 intron 7 ApaI polymorphism may be associated with human NSCLC",

    "Title": "Comprehensive biomarker and genomic analysis identifies p53 status as the major determinant of response to MDM2 inhibitors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia",
    "Abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the Western world and remains incurable with conventional therapies. Patients with relapsed or resistant CLL have a significantly shortened lifespan. MDM2 inhibitors have been developed and may have significant potential in the treatment of CLL. Clinical development of these compounds would be aided through knowledge of molecular predictors of activity. To understand determinants of sensitivity or resistance to MDM2 inhibitor therapy in CLL, we comprehensively analyzed a large cohort of CLL patient-derived samples for response to MDM2 inhibition and correlated these responses with clinically important biomarkers. Furthermore, we employed high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to analyze genomewide changes of copy number and allele status, including that of p53. The results of these studies conclusively demonstrate that p53 status is the major determinant of response to MDM2 inhibitors in CLL. Additional defects in the p53 regulatory cascade do not appear operational in this leukemia. Further, we identify a novel subgroup of patients with CLL with early progressive disease that appears particularly sensitive to MDM2 inhibitor treatment. These data provide definitive evidence for target-specific and predictive activity and a rationale to proceed with this potentially important class of compounds in the treatment of CLL",

    "Abstract": "Human cancer cells typically harbour multiple chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas--the most common type of adult brain cancer--and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer",

    "Title": "BK virus as a cofactor in the etiology of prostate cancer in its early stages",
    "Abstract": "Prostate cancer has been projected to cause almost 10% of all male cancer deaths in the United States in 2007. The incidence of mutations in the tumor suppressor genes Rb1 and p53, especially in the early stages of the disease, is low compared to those for other cancers. This has led to the hypothesis that a human virus such as BK virus (BKV), which establishes a persistent subclinical infection in the urinary tract and encodes oncoproteins that interfere with these tumor suppressor pathways, is involved. Previously, we detected BKV DNA in the epithelial cells of benign and proliferative inflammatory atrophy ducts of cancerous prostate specimens. In the present report, we demonstrate that BKV is present at a much lower frequency in noncancerous prostates. Additionally, in normal prostates, T-antigen (TAg) expression is observed only in specimens harboring proliferative inflammatory atrophy and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. We further demonstrate that the p53 gene from atrophic cells expressing TAg is wild type, whereas tumor cells expressing detectable nuclear p53 contain a mix of wild-type and mutant p53 genes, suggesting that TAg may inactivate p53 in the atrophic cells. Our results point toward a role for BKV in early prostate cancer progression",

To identify the genetic alterations in GBMs, we sequenced 20,661 protein coding genes, determined the presence of amplifications and deletions using high-density oligonucleotide arrays, and performed gene expression analyses using next-generation sequencing technologies in 22 human tumor samples. This comprehensive analysis led to the discovery of a variety of genes that were not known to be altered in GBMs. Most notably, we found recurrent mutations in the active site of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) in 12% of GBM patients. Mutations in IDH1 occurred in a large fraction of young patients and in most patients with secondary GBMs and were associated with an increase in overall survival.

    "Abstract": "There are currently few therapeutic options for patients with pancreatic cancer, and new insights into the pathogenesis of this lethal disease are urgently needed. Toward this end, we performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of 24 pancreatic cancers. We first determined the sequences of 23,219 transcripts, representing 20,661 protein-coding genes, in these samples. Then, we searched for homozygous deletions and amplifications in the tumor DNA by using microarrays containing probes for approximately 10(6) single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We found that pancreatic cancers contain an average of 63 genetic alterations, the majority of which are point mutations. These alterations defined a core set of 12 cellular signaling pathways and processes that were each genetically altered in 67 to 100% of the tumors. Analysis of these tumors' transcriptomes with next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis technologies provided independent evidence for the importance of these pathways and processes. Our data indicate that genetically altered core pathways and regulatory processes only become evident once the coding regions of the genome are analyzed in depth. Dysregulation of these core pathways and processes through mutation can explain the major features of pancreatic tumorigenesis",

    "Title": "CHEK2 mutations affecting kinase activity together with mutations in TP53 indicate a functional pathway associated with resistance to epirubicin in primary breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemoresistance is the main obstacle to cure in most malignant diseases. Anthracyclines are among the main drugs used for breast cancer therapy and in many other malignant conditions. Single parameter analysis or global gene expression profiles have failed to identify mechanisms causing in vivo resistance to anthracyclines. While we previously found TP53 mutations in the L2/L3 domains to be associated with drug resistance, some tumors harboring wild-type TP53 were also therapy resistant. The aim of this study was; 1) To explore alterations in the TP53 gene with respect to resistance to a regular dose epirubicin regimen (90 mg/m(2) every 3 week) in patients with primary, locally advanced breast cancer; 2) Identify critical mechanisms activating p53 in response to DNA damage in breast cancer; 3) Evaluate in vitro function of Chk2 and p14 proteins corresponding to identified mutations in the CHEK2 and p14((ARF)) genes; and 4) Explore potential CHEK2 or p14((ARF)) germline mutations with respect to family cancer incidence. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Snap-frozen biopsies from 109 patients collected prior to epirubicin (as preoperative therapy were investigated for TP53, CHEK2 and p14((ARF)) mutations by sequencing the coding region and p14((ARF)) promoter methylations. TP53 mutations were associated with chemoresistance, defined as progressive disease on therapy (p = 0.0358; p = 0.0136 for mutations affecting p53 loop domains L2/L3). Germline CHEK2 mutations (n = 3) were associated with therapy resistance (p = 0.0226). Combined, mutations affecting either CHEK2 or TP53 strongly predicted therapy resistance (p = 0.0101; TP53 mutations restricted to the L2/L3 domains: p = 0.0032). Two patients progressing on therapy harbored the CHEK2 mutation, Arg95Ter, completely abrogating Chk2 protein dimerization and kinase activity. One patient (Epi132) revealed family cancer occurrence resembling families harboring CHEK2 mutations in general, the other patient (epi203) was non-conclusive. No mutation or promoter hypermethylation in p14((ARF)) were detected. CONCLUSION: This study is the first reporting an association between CHEK2 mutations and therapy resistance in human cancers and to document mutations in two genes acting direct up/down-stream to each other to cause therapy failure, emphasizing the need to investigate functional cascades in future studies",

    "Title": "PIK3CA cancer mutations display gender and tissue specificity patterns",
    "Abstract": "The occurrence of oncogenic alleles can display striking tissue specificity. For example KRAS mutations are very frequent in pancreatic cancers but relatively rare in melanomas. The opposite is true for BRAF mutations. Somatic mutations in the gene encoding for the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KCA) catalytic subunit, PIK3CA, occur at high frequency in many solid cancers. We have examined whether PI3K oncogenic mutations (exons 9 and 20) might exhibit gender and/or tissue specificity. By examining large cohorts of breast and colorectal cancers affecting both men and women we found that the pattern of PIK3CA mutations is distinctive. In colorectal cancers, PIK3CA (but not KRAS, APC, or TP53) mutations display a gender bias occurring at higher frequencies in women. We also found that male breast cancers display PIK3CA mutations at an overall frequency similar to that observed in female breast tumors. In male breast cancers, however, PIK3CA mutations are found mainly in exon 20. We conclude that PI3KCA mutations affecting exons 9 and 20 display gender- and tissue-specific patterns, thus suggesting that the different amino acid changes could exert distinct functional effects on the oncogenic properties of this enzyme. Furthermore, we propose that sexual dimorphisms and tissue specific factors might directly or indirectly influence the occurrence of PI3KCA cancer alleles",

    "Title": "Germline and somatic NF1 gene mutation spectrum in NF1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs)",
    "Abstract": "About 10% of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and represent considerable patient morbidity and mortality. Elucidation of the genetic mechanisms by which inherited and acquired NF1 disease gene variants lead to MPNST development is important. A study was undertaken to identify the constitutional and somatic NF1 mutations in 34 MPNSTs from 27 NF1 patients. The NF1 germline mutations identified in 22 lymphocytes DNA from these patients included seven novel mutations and a large 1.4-Mb deletion. The NF1 germline mutation spectrum was similar to that previously identified in adult NF1 patients without MPNST. Somatic NF1 mutations were identified in tumor DNA from 31 out of 34 MPNSTs, of which 28 were large genomic deletions. The high prevalence (>90%) of such deletions in MPNST contrast with the =or<20% found in benign neurofibromas and is indicative of the involvement of different mutational mechanisms in these tumors. Coinactivation of the TP53 gene by deletion, or by point mutation along with NF1 gene inactivation, is known to exacerbate disease symptoms in NF1, therefore TP53 gene inactivation was screened. DNA from 20 tumors showed evidence for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) across the TP53 region in 11 samples, with novel TP53 point mutations in four tumors",

    "Abstract": "Identifying mutations in the TP53 gene is important for cancer prognosis, predicting response to therapy, and determining genetic risk. We have developed a high-throughput scanning assay with automatic calling to detect TP53 mutations in DNA from fresh frozen (FF) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. The coding region of the TP53 gene (exons 2-11) was PCR-amplified from breast cancer samples and scanned by high-resolution fluorescent melting curve analyses using a 384-well format in the LightCycler 480 instrument. Mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing. Sensitivity and specificity of scanning and automatic mutation calling was determined for FF tissue (whole genome amplified [WGA] and non-WGA) and FFPE tissue. Thresholds for automatic mutation calling were established for each preparation type. Overall, we confirmed 27 TP53 mutations in 68 primary breast cancers analyzed by high-resolution melting curve scanning and direct sequencing. Using scanning and automatic calling, there was high specificity (>95%) across all DNA preparation methods. Sensitivities ranged from 100% in non-WGA DNA from fresh tissue to 86% in WGA DNA and DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Scanning could detect mutated DNA at a dilution of 1:200 in a background of wild-type DNA. Mutation scanning by high-resolution fluorescent melting curve analyses can be done in a high-throughput and automated fashion. The TP53 scanning assay can be performed from a variety of specimen types with high sensitivity/specificity and could be used for clinical and research purposes",

    "Title": "Chromosome instability in human hepatocellular carcinoma depends on p53 status and aflatoxin exposure",
    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous disease triggered by various risk factors and frequently characterized by chromosome instability. This instability is considered to be caused primarily by Hepatitis B virus (HBV), although aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a potent fungal mutagen is also suspected to influence chromosomal repair. We studied 90 HCCs from Italy, the country with the highest incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in Europe, 81 samples from France and 52 specimens from Shanghai, in a region where intake of AFB1 via the diet is known to be high. All 223 tumours were characterized for 15 different genomic targets, including allelic loss at 13 chromosome arms and mutations of beta-catenin and p53 genes. Despite disparity in risk-factor distribution, Italian and French cases did not significantly differ for 14 of the 15 targets tested. beta-Catenin and p53 displayed moderate and similar mutation rates (18-29% of cases) in European series. By contrast, tumours from Shanghai were significantly different, with a lower mutation rate for beta-catenin (4% vs. 26%, p<0.0003) and a higher mutation rate for p53 (48% vs. 22%, p<0.0001) when compared with tumours of European origin. The Arg249Ser mutation, hallmark of exposure to AFB1, represented half of the changes in p53 in Shanghai. Furthermore, when stratified for the presence of HBV or p53 mutations, chromosome instability was always higher in Chinese than in European patients. This difference was particularly strong in p53-wildtype tumours (fractional allelic loss, 29.4% vs. 16.7%, p<0.0001). We suggest that AFB1-associated mutagenesis represents a plausible cause for the higher chromosome instability observed in Chinese HCCs, when compared with European primary liver carcinomas",

    "Title": "Large-scale analysis of the genetic and epigenetic alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma from Southeast China",
    "Abstract": "Our knowledge about molecular alterations during hepatocarcinogenesis is still fragmentary, due to lack of comprehensive genetic and epigenetic analyses in the same set of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). In this study, we conducted a large-scale analysis, including mutation screening in 50 genes and methylation assays in three genes in 54 pairs of HCCs and their neighboring non-cancerous tissues. All samples were collected from the residents in Southeast China. We found HBV infection and chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis in 83.3% and 98.1% of the cases, respectively. Mutations were identified in 18 out of 54 (33.3%) samples, with p53 alterations in 14 cases and beta-catenin mutations in four tumors. No mutations were identified in the neighboring tissues. Interestingly, 9 out of 14 (64.3%) tumors carrying p53 mutations displayed substitution of serine by arginine at codon 249, a characteristic change believed to be induced by aflatoxin-B1. Furthermore, p53 mutation was significantly associated with shorter recurrence-free survival (P=0.004). The results also revealed aberrant methylation in two or more genes in as high as 90% of tumors and 40% of adjacent tissues. The frequency of RASSF1A hypermethylation was much higher than that of p16INK4a and HAI2 in both HCC and neighboring tissues, indicating that deregulation of RASSF1A may precede the other two genes. These data suggest that aberrant methylation occurs before mutation and is an early event in the development of this set of HCC. Our findings highlight p53 as a prognostic factor of HCC and RASSF1A as a potential target in preventing malignant transformation of hepatocytes",

    "Title": "Establishment and molecular profiling of a novel human pancreatic cancer panel for 5-FU",
    "Abstract": "Ten novel human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (Sui65 through Sui74) were established from a transplantable pancreatic carcinoma cell line. All the cell lines resembled the original clinical carcinoma in terms of the morphological and biological features, presenting with genetic alterations such as point mutations of K-ras and p53, attenuation or lack of SMAD4 and p16 and other relevant cellular characteristics. Using this panel, we evaluated the effects of 5-FU in suppressing the proliferation of pancreatic carcinoma cells. When tested in vitro, although Sui72 was highly susceptible to 5-FU, the other cell lines were found to be resistant to the drug. When Sui72 and Sui70 were implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice followed by treatment with 5-FU, the drug was found to be effective against Sui72 but not Sui70, consistent with the results in vitro. In order to identify the molecular determinant for high sensitivity of Sui72 to 5-FU, we examined the mRNA expression levels of the metabolic enzymes of 5-FU. Decreased expression of DPYD was observed in Sui72 as compared with other cell lines (0.1 versus 0.6 +/- 0.5, 0.1-fold). It is believed that the novel cell lines established in the present study will be useful for analyzing the pattern of progression of pancreatic cancer and for evaluating the efficacy of anticancer agents",

    "Abstract": "Small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder is a rare entity known as an aggressive tumor. As it is rarely associated with transitional cell carcinoma in situ but more commonly with invasive transitional cell carcinoma, its origin is not well understood. We report a case of small cell carcinoma with coexisting transitional cell carcinoma in situ, where histologic mapping and parallel immunohistochemical and molecular analyses (TP53 mutation analyses, loss of heterozygosity) were performed. Immunohistochemical characterization (synaptophysin, thyroid transcription factor-1, chromogranin A, neuron specific enolase, CD56, CK, CK7, CK20, CD44v6, and p53) emphasized the morphology. Identical point mutations of TP53 were identified in invasive small cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma in situ. No loss of heterozygosity of microsatellite markers D3S3050, D9S303, D9S304, D9S171, D9S775, D9S1748, D9S1751, D17S786, D17S918, and TP53alu was found in either component. We provide, for the first time, molecular evidence for the development of invasive small cell carcinoma out of transitional cell carcinoma in situ",

    "Title": "Sporadic childhood hepatoblastomas show activation of beta-catenin, mismatch repair defects and p53 mutations",
    "Abstract": "Hepatoblastoma, a rare embryonic tumor that may arise sporadically or in the context of hereditary syndromes (familial adenomatous polyposis and Beckwith-Wiedemann's) is the most frequent liver cancer of childhood. Deregulation of the APC/beta-catenin pathway occurs in a consistent fraction of hepatoblastomas, with mutations in the APC and beta-catenin genes implicated in familial adenomatous polyposis-associated and sporadic hepatoblastomas, respectively. Alterations in other cancer-related molecular pathways have not been reported. We investigated a series of 21 sporadic paraffin-embedded hepatoblastoma cases for mutations in the p53 (exons 5-8) and beta-catenin (exon 3) genes, loss of heterozygosity at APC, microsatellite instability and immunohistochemical expression of beta-catenin and of the two main mismatch repair proteins, MLH1 and MSH2. No loss of heterozygosity at APC was detected. We found mutations in beta-catenin and p53 in 4/21 (19%) and 5/21 (24%) cases respectively, beta-catenin protein accumulation in 14/21 cases (67%), microsatellite instability in 17/21 cases (81%), of which eight resulted positive for high-level of microsatellite instability (in four cases associated with loss of MLH1/MSH2 immunostaining). No correlations between involved molecular pathway(s) and hepatoblastoma histotype(s) emerged. This study confirms that beta-catenin deregulation is involved in sporadic hepatoblastoma and also suggests that mismatch repair defects and p53 mutations contribute to this rare liver cancer. Sporadic hepatoblastoma appears to be molecularly and phenotypically heterogeneous and may reflect different pathways of liver carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Cyclin D1 expression analysis in familial breast cancers may discriminate BRCAX from BRCA2-linked cases",
    "Abstract": "Most familial breast cancers arise in patients who tested negative for germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (also referred to as BRCAX cases). Several studies aimed to define histopathological and molecular profiles characteristic of BRCA1, BRCA2 and BRCAX tumors have been performed. Major pathological and immunohistochemical differences have been reported in BRCA1 cancers compared to the other two groups, whereas less difference has been observed between BRCA2 and BRCAX cases. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of selected tumor markers to discriminate BRCAX breast cancers from cancers arising in carriers of mutations in BRCA genes, and their usefulness in selecting familial cases in whom testing for such mutations is more likely to result uninformative. We carried out a morphological and immunohistochemical analysis on 22 BRCA1, 16 BRCA2 and 33 BRCAX familial breast cancers. Age at first diagnosis, histological type and grade, and immunostaining for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), p53, HER2/Neu, E-cadherin and cyclin D1 were investigated. The occurrence of somatic mutations of the TP53 gene was also verified. BRCA1 tumors resulted clearly distinguishable from BRCAX cases, occurring at a younger age, being more frequently of higher grade, negative for ER, PR and cyclin D1 expression and positive for p53 alterations. The predictive value of age at diagnosis, histological grade and PR expression was confirmed in a multivariable analysis. When comparing BRCA2 with BRCAX tumors, the only parameter that differed was cyclin D1, which was significantly overexpressed in BRCA2 cases both in the univariable and the multivariable analyses. If confirmed by further studies, our observations indicate that the investigation of cyclin D1 expression in familial breast cancer cases could be used, in conjunction with the analysis of other tumor markers preferentially associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumors, to prioritize hereditary cases for mutation testing in BRCA genes",

    "Title": "KLF6 and TP53 mutations are a rare event in prostate cancer: distinguishing between Taq polymerase artifacts and true mutations",
    "Abstract": "Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor gene involved in the regulation of the cell cycle by activating p21 in a p53-independent manner. Many studies suggest that KLF6 is inactivated by allelic loss and somatic mutation. However, there is a high variability in the reported frequency of mutations (from 1 to 55%). TP53 also regulates the cell cycle through the activation of p21. In prostate cancer, the reported frequency of TP53 mutations ranges from 3 to 42%. In all these reports, there is a considerable degree of methodological heterogeneity. Our aim was to determine the frequency of KLF6 and TP53 mutations in a well-defined group of prostate tumors with different stages and Gleason grades. The four exons of KLF6 and exons 4-9 of TP53 were studied in 103 cases, including 90 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and 13 frozen samples. All tumors were analyzed through PCR and direct sequencing. All changes found were confirmed by a second independent PCR and sequencing reaction. For KLF6, mutation (E227G) was only detected in one tumor (1%) and for TP53, three different mutations (L130H, H214R, and Y234C) were detected in five tumors (5%). This low mutation index is in keeping with recent papers on the subject. Our study strongly supports the notion that KLF6 and TP53 mutations are not frequent events in prostate cancer. When using FFPE tissues, it is mandatory to perform at least two independent rounds of PCR and sequencing to confirm mutations and exclude Taq polymerase-induced artifacts",

    "Title": "Clinical significance of p53 alterations in surgically treated prostate cancers",
    "Abstract": "Despite the high number of previous studies, the role of p53 alterations in prostate cancer is not clearly defined. To address the role of p53 alterations in prostate cancer biology, a total of 2514 cancers treated by radical prostatectomy were successfully analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray format. Overall a low rate of p53-positive tumors was found (2.5%). A significant underestimation of p53-positive cases was excluded by subsequent large section analyses and direct sequencing of the p53 gene in subsets of our patients. Large section analysis of 23 cases considered negative on the tissue microarray yielded only one weakly p53-positive tumor. Only 4 out of 64 (6.4%) high-grade tumors, that were considered negative for p53 by immunohistochemistry, presented exon 5-8 mutations. These data suggest a high sensitivity of our immunohistochemistry approach and confirm the overall low frequency of p53 alterations in clinically localized prostate cancer. A positive p53 immunostaining was strongly associated with presence of exon 5-8 mutations (P<0.0001), advanced pT-stage (P<0.0001), high Gleason grade (P<0.0001), positive surgical margins (P=0.03) and early biochemical tumor recurrence (P<0.0001). A higher rate of positive p53 immunostaining was detected in late-stage diseases including metastatic prostate cancer (P=0.0152) and hormone-refractory tumors (P=0.0003). Moreover, p53 expression was identified as an independent predictor of biochemical tumor recurrence in the subgroup of low- and intermediate-grade cancers. In summary, the results of this study show that p53 mutations characterize a small biologically aggressive subgroup of prostate cancers with a high risk of progression after prostatectomy. The rate of p53 alterations increases with prostate cancer progression",

    "Abstract": "Penile carcinoma is a rare disease, accordingly there are few studies on molecular changes, and these results also vary greatly. A total of 26 penile squamous cell carcinomas in Japanese men were studied with respect to HPV, p53 alterations, and methylation of gene promoter region. HPV-DNA was detected in three of 26 patients (11.5%). Overexpression of p53 was observed in 13 of 26 patients (50%), and p53 gene mutations were detected in four of 26 patients (15.4%). The frequency of methylation was as follows: DAPK, 26.9% (7/26); FHIT, 88.4% (23/26); MGMT, 19.2% (5/26); p14, 3.8% (1/26); p16, 23.1% (6/26); RAR-beta, 23.1% (6/26); RASSF1A, 11.5% (3/26); and RUNX3, 42.3% (11/26). As for correlation between HPV and p53 alterations, and methylation status, mutations of the p53 gene were detected only in HPV-negative patients, and methylation was more frequently found in HPV-negative than in HPV-positive patients. The present results suggest that the majority of penile squamous cell carcinomas in Japanese men are unrelated to HPV, and gene alterations accumulate more frequently in HPV-unrelated penile carcinomas",

    "Title": "Presence of dominant negative mutation of TP53 is a risk of early recurrence in oral cancer",
    "Abstract": "Genetic alteration of p53 is a significant determining factor in the carcinogenesis. The loss of function, mutant p53 can possess a dominant negative effect on wild-type p53 and may also exert gain-of-function activity. It is, however, not clear how p53 functional status due to various types of mutation results in outcome of patients with oral cancer. A total of 60 oral SCC samples were subjected to yeast functional assay that screens human p53 function in yeast, and sequencing for determination of p53 mutations. The detected mutants were further investigated for their dominant negative activity using a yeast-based transdominance assay that tests dominant negative activity of a mutant p53 over wild-type p53 by coexpressing the mutant and wild-type p53 in a yeast transcriptional reporter system. p53 mutation was found in 42 out of 60 of which 10 (24%) exhibited dominant negative activity and 32 (76%) without dominant activity (recessive mutation). The remaining 18 (30%) were considered to have wild-type p53. The patients with dominant negative mutation had significantly shorter disease-free survival than patients with no mutation (log-rank test, p<0.001) and those with a recessive mutation (p<0.016). There were slight significant differences in disease-free survival were found between the patients with tumours harbouring a recessive p53 mutation and those with tumours harbouring a wild-type p53 (p<0.038). The presence and absence of a dominant negative p53 mutation may thus provide a predictor of early recurrence in oral SCC patients",

    "Title": "Effect of p53 codon 72 genotype on breast cancer survival depends on p53 gene status",
    "Abstract": "In vitro studies suggest that p53 codon 72 genotype alters the apoptotic capacity of p53 protein, with the 72 arginine (R) form of wild-type p53 harboring a greater apoptosis-inducing potential than the 72 proline (P) variant. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the association between the p53 codon 72 genotype and breast cancer survival was modified by p53 gene status. In our study, we examined the p53 codon 72 genotype and p53 mutations (through exons 4-9) in paraffin-embedded specimens from 414 breast cancer patients with a median follow-up of 8.2 years. We report that the p53 codon 72 genotype was significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS, p = 0.02) but not with disease-specific survival (DSS, p = 0.24) in the entire study population (n = 414). In contrast, the codon 72 genotype was strongly associated with both DFS (p = 0.001) and DSS (p = 0.04) among patients with a wild-type p53 tumor (n = 346), patients with the P/P variant had worse DFS and DSS than did those with the P/R or R/R variant in this subgroup of patients. More importantly, as compared with the P/R or R/R variant, the P/P variant remained an independent prognostic factor of DFS among patients with a wild-type p53 tumor (HR = 2.5; 95%CI = 1.4-4.4; p = 0.003). We conclude that the effect of p53 codon 72 genotype on breast cancer survival is dependent on p53 gene status, the P/P variant is strongly associated with poor prognosis among patients with a wild-type p53 tumor",

FAK is a critical regulator of adhesion, motility, metastasis, and survival signaling. We have characterized the FAK promoter and demonstrated that p53 can inhibit the FAK promoter activity in vitro. In the present study, we showed that p53 can bind the FAK promoter-chromatin region in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Furthermore, we demonstrated down-regulation of FAK mRNA and protein levels by adenoviral overexpression of p53. We introduced plasmids with different mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53 (R175H, p53 R248W and R273H) into HCTp53(-/-) cells and showed that these mutations of p53 did not bind FAK promoter and did not inhibit FAK promoter activity, unlike wild type p53. We analyzed primary breast and colon cancers for p53 mutations and FAK expression, and showed that FAK expression was increased in tumors containing mutations of p53 compared to tumors with wild type p53. In addition, tumor-derived missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain (R282, R249, and V173) also led to increased FAK promoter activity. Thus, the present data show that p53 can regulate FAK expression during tumorigenesis",

    "Title": "Polymorphisms in drug metabolism genes, smoking, and p53 mutations in breast cancer",
    "Abstract": "Polymorphisms in phase I and phase II enzymes may enhance the occurrence of mutations at critical tumor suppressor genes, such as p53, and increase breast cancer risk by either increasing the activation or detoxification of carcinogens and/or endogenous estrogens. We analyzed polymorphisms in CYP1B1, GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 and p53 mutations in 323 breast tumor samples. Approximately 11% of patients exhibited mutations in p53. Women with mutations had a significantly younger age of diagnosis (P = 0.01) and a greater incidence of tumors classified as stage II or higher (P = 0.002). More women with mutations had a history of smoking (55%) compared to women without mutations (39%). Although none of the genotypes alone were associated with p53 mutations, positive smoking history was associated with p53 mutations in women with the GSTM1 null allele [OR = 3.54; 95% CI = 0.97-12.90 P = 0.06] compared to women with the wild-type genotype and smoking history [OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.19-2.07], although this association did not reach statistical significance. To test for gene-gene interactions, our exploratory analysis in the Caucasian cases suggested that individuals with the combined GSTP1 105 VV, CYP1B1 432 LV/VV, and GSTM1 positive genotype were more likely to harbor mutations in p53 [OR = 4.94; 95% CI = 1.11-22.06]. Our results suggest that gene-smoking and gene-gene interactions may impact the prevalence of p53 mutations in breast tumors. Elucidating the etiology of breast cancer as a consequence of common genetic polymorphisms and the genotoxic effects of smoking will enable us to improve the design of prevention strategies, such as lifestyle modifications, in genetically susceptible subpopulations",

    "Abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated as a potential causative factor for endogenous p53 mutations in gastrointestinal malignancy. To investigate the role of NO in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EADC), we studied patterns of p53 mutations, expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the tissue accumulation of nitrotyrosine (NTS), a stable reaction product of NO and a marker for cellular protein damage, in human premalignant and malignant esophageal epithelia. Tissues were obtained from patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-induced esophagitis (n = 76), Barrett's esophagus (BE; n = 119) and primary EADC (n = 54). DNA sequencing was used to characterize p53 mutations, RT-PCR to study iNOS mRNA expression, and immunohistochemistry to study NTS. Relative to self-matched normal epithelia, a progressive increase in iNOS mRNA expression was seen in GERD (30%; 23/76), BE (48%; 57/119), and EADC (63%; 34/54) tissues (P < 0.001). Among patients with EADC, elevated levels of NTS immunoreactivity were more frequent in tumors with p53 mutations (11/21; 52%) compared with tumors with wild-type p53 (9/33; 27%; P = 0.063), and specifically in tumors with p53 mutations at CpG dinucleotides (10/12; 83%) compared with non-CpG p53 mutations (1/9; 11%; P = 0.008). The increasing frequency of iNOS (mRNA) overexpression in GERD, BE and EADC supports the hypothesis that an active inflammatory process, most likely a consequence of GERD, underlies molecular progression to EADC. The highly significant association between NTS, reflecting chronic NO-induced cellular protein damage, and endogenous p53 mutations at CpG dinucleotides, provides further evidence for a molecular link between chronic inflammation and esophageal malignancy",

    "Title": "TP53 gene mutations as an independent marker for urinary bladder cancer progression",
    "Abstract": "This study evaluates the influence of the TP53 genetic status on tumour recurrence and progression with a highly effective electrophoretic technique. DNA from tissue of 75 non-invasive urinary bladder cancers was PCR amplified in the TP53 exons 5-8 and run on horizontal polyacrylamide gels under defined temperature conditions to yield specific gel shifts. Kaplan-Meier and Cox-Regression analysis were performed with tumour progression. The overall tumour recurrence in our patient population was 76.0% (57/75). Tumour recurrence frequency was 69.4% (34/49) in patients with TP53 wild-type, and 88.5% (23/26) in patients with TP53 mutation. There was no statistically significant difference with regard to recurrence frequency and time to recurrence. The progression-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with TP53 mutations, and the frequency of tumour progression was significantly higher in mutated as compared to wild-type tumours. Cox-Regression analysis showed a significant and independent influence of TP53 mutation on tumour progression in comparison with tumour grade, stage and history of prior bladder cancer. If segregated by exons, mutations in the DNA binding region of exon 8 seem to have a particular high influence on tumour progression. We conclude that genetic analysis of TP53 can select patients at high risk of bladder tumour progression that should be followed closely and may benefit from early radical surgical procedures",

METHODS: p53 protein expression in polygonal cells and cuboidal cells in 19 patients with PSH was detected using immunohistochemistry. The two major cell types were captured using laser capture microdissection technology. Mutations in the p53 gene (exons 5-8) were examined using single-stranded conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing analysis. RESULTS: p53 protein expression and gene mutations were observed in 15.8% (3/19) of cases. In these cases, p53 protein was expressed in the nucleus of both cell types, with higher expression levels and mutation rates in polygonal cells than in surface cuboidal cells. Two cases showed mutation only in the polygonal cells, while one case showed double (separate) mutations in both the polygonal and cuboidal cells. CONCLUSIONS: p53 mutation was exhibited in PSH. The mutation rate in polygonal cells was higher than that in surface cuboidal cells",

    "Title": "Gains of chromosome region 3q26 in intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva are frequent and independent of HPV status",
    "Abstract": "AIMS: Two different forms of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) are recognised: (1) usual-type (bowenoid) VIN, which is related to high-risk papillomavirus infection, and (2) differentiated (simplex) VIN, which is associated with chronic inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of chromosome 3q26 gains in the spectrum of precancerous lesions and invasive squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the vulva. METHODS: 3q26 gains were analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridisation in a series of usual-type VINs, VINs of the differentiated type and invasive squamous cell carcinomas. In addition, all cases were examined for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, p53 mutations, and p16 and p53 protein expression. RESULTS: Gains of chromosome 3q26 were present in all VINs of the differentiated type and in 50% of the usual-type VIN lesions. 81% of SCCs were positive for 3q26 gains irrespective of the HPV status and of the associated precursor lesion. HPV-associated lesions exhibited the typical, strong cytoplasmic p16 accumulation while mutated p53 was only detected in HPV-negative VINs or SCCs, and was associated with an overexpression of p53 protein. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical evaluation of p16 and p53 expression aids in the differential diagnosis of squamous cell alterations of the vulva. However, detection of 3q26 imbalance is of additional diagnostic value in difficult cases of HPV-unrelated usual-type VINs and VINs of the differentiated type",

The aims of this study were to determine whether p53 mutation status and p53 and p33(ING1b) protein expression can predict which patients with Dukes' C colorectal cancer following curative surgical resection respond to adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). METHOD: Patients with Dukes'C colorectal cancer (n = 41) were studied. DNA was extracted and analysed for p53 mutation using PCR-based direct DNA sequencing. Tumours were analysed for p53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry using DO-7 monoclonal antibody and for p33(ING1b) protein expression using GN1 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: There was a significant association between p53 mutation status analysed by gene sequencing and overall and metastasis-free survival (P = 0.03 and 0.004, respectively, log-rank test). By contrast, no significant correlation was found between p53 and p33(ING1b) protein expression and overall or metastasis-free survival. CONCLUSION: In patients with Dukes'C colorectal cancer who underwent curative surgical resection of the primary tumour, followed by 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy, p53 mutation status as assessed by gene sequencing is a significant predictor of overall and metastasis-free survival",

    "Title": "Overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and accumulation of 8-OHdG in nasopharyngeal carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "AIMS: Nitric oxide (NO), produced by inducible NO synthase (iNOS), has been suggested to cause oxidative stress, leading to 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) accumulation and subsequent transversion mutation of DNA. The aim was to evaluate iNOS expression and the status of oxidative stress in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-three cases of NPC were investigated to examine the immunohistochemical expression of iNOS, 8-OHdG and latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER) expression using in situ hybridization. iNOS mRNA expression and p53 gene mutations were also assessed. Overexpression of iNOS, LMP-1 and EBER was observed in 62 (84.9%), 28 (38.4%) and 53 (72.6%) cases respectively. p53 gene mutation was found in 10 of 73 (13.7%) cases. Immunohistochemical iNOS expression was associated with the 8-OHdG labelling index, iNOS mRNA expression and p53 gene alteration (P < 0.0001, P = 0.016 and 0.0082 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our present findings suggest that the expression of iNOS induces oxidative stress in NPC. Although the presence of p53 mutation was associated with iNOS overexpression, the type of acid-base change of p53 was transition, but not transversion, which suggests that the p53 gene is not the direct target of DNA damage by 8-OHdG accumulation",

    "Title": "Identification and functional characterization of the human glutathione S-transferase P1 gene as a novel transcriptional target of the p53 tumor suppressor gene",
    "Abstract": "The glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) is involved in multiple cellular functions, including phase II metabolism, stress response, signaling, and apoptosis. The mechanisms underlying the significantly high GSTP1 expression in many human tumors are, however, currently not well understood. We report here that the GSTP1 gene is a heretofore unrecognized downstream transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor p53. We identified a p53-binding motif comprising two consecutive half-sites located in intron 4 of the GSTP1 gene and is highly homologous to consensus p53-binding motifs in other p53-responsive genes. Using a combination of electrophoretic mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting analyses, we showed that wild-type p53 protein binds to the GSTP1 p53 motif and luciferase reporter assays showed the motif to be transcriptionally functional in human tumor cells. In a temperature-sensitive p53-mutant cells, levels of both p21/WAF1 and GSTP1 gene transcripts increased time dependently when cells were switched from the inactive mutant state to the wild-type p53 state. Small interfering RNA-mediated reduction of p53 expression resulted in a specific decrease in GSTP1 expression and in tumor cells with mutated p53; adenovirally mediated expression of wild-type p53 increased GSTP1 expression significantly. In a panel of early-passage brain tumor cultures from patients, high levels of GSTP1 transcripts and protein were associated with wild-type p53 and, conversely, low GSTP1 levels with mutant p53. p53 expression knockdown by small interfering RNA increased cisplatin sensitivity. The ability of wild-type p53 to transcriptionally activate the human GSTP1 gene defines a novel mechanism of protecting the genome and, potentially, of tumor drug resistance",

    "Title": "Bendamustine is effective in p53-deficient B-cell neoplasms and requires oxidative stress and caspase-independent signaling",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) are two incurable B-cell lymphoid neoplasms characterized by distinct clinical presentation and evolution. Bendamustine hydrochloride is a multifunctional, alkylating agent with a purine-like ring system that exhibits activity in multiple cancer models, including CLL and MCL, but whose mechanism is only partially described. Our aim was to analyze the apoptotic pathways activated by bendamustine in CLL and MCL together with the relevance of p53 mutation in determining the response to this drug. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirteen CLL/MCL cell lines and primary tumor cells from 8 MCL and 25 CLL patients were cultured for up to 24 h with bendamustine followed by cytotoxic assays, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis of p53 response pathway and apoptosis-related factors. RESULTS: Bendamustine displayed cytotoxic activity on most CLL and MCL primary cells and cell lines irrespective of ZAP-70 expression and p53 status. Bendamustine was found to act synergistically with nucleoside analogues in both CLL and MCL, this combination being effective in p53 mutated cases resistant to standard chemotherapy. Bendamustine cytotoxicity was mediated by the generation of reactive oxygen species and triggering of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway involving up-regulation of PUMA and NOXA, conformational activation of BAX and BAK, and cytosolic release of caspase-related and caspase-unrelated mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the use of bendamustine as a therapeutic agent, alone or in combination, for CLL and MCL with p53 alterations and describe the molecular basis of its activity in these entities",

    "Title": "Mutations in the Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene in medulloblastomas",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Cerebellar medulloblastoma is a highly malignant, invasive embryonal tumor with preferential manifestation in children. Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) with NBS1 germ-line mutations is a rare autosomal recessive disease with clinical features that include microcephaly, mental and growth retardation, immunodeficiency, increased radiosensitivity, and predisposition to cancer. There may be functional interactions between NBS1 and the TP53 pathways. The objective of the present study is to assess whether NBS1 mutations play a role in the pathogenesis of sporadic medulloblastomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Forty-two cases of medulloblastomas were screened for mutations in the NBS1 gene (all 16 exons) and the TP53 gene (exons 5-8) by single-stranded conformational polymorphism followed by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Seven of 42 (17%) medulloblastomas carried a total of 15 NBS1 mutations. Of these, 10 were missense point mutations and 5 were intronic splicing mutations. None of these were reported previously as germ-line mutations in NBS patients. No NBS1 mutations were detected in peritumoral brain tissues available in two patients. Of 5 medulloblastomas with TP53 mutations, 4 (80%) contained NBS1 mutations, and there was a significant association between TP53 mutations and NBS1 mutations (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence of medulloblastomas characterized by NBS1 mutations typically associated with mutational inactivation of the TP53 gene",

    "Abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) lines proliferative in the serum-free conditions devised for normal oral keratinocytes (NOK) are virtually absent, complicating studies of carcinogenesis. A tongue squamous cell carcinoma generated under conditions for normal cell culture an apparently immortal line (termed LK0412) that has undergone >or=200 population doublings from over a year in culture. LK0412 exhibited epithelial morphology, intermediate filaments, desmosomes, and cytokeratin. Soft agar growth and tumorigenicity in athymic nude mice indicated the malignant phenotype. Compared with NOK, LK0412 exhibited increased indices for proliferation and apoptosis, and a decreased terminal differentiation index. Fetal bovine serum inhibited growth and increased apoptosis but failed to induce terminal differentiation of LK0412; the latter outcome differed clearly from that in NOK. Gene ontology assessment of transcript profiles implicated multiple alterations in biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components in LK0412. Genetic changes, some that were confirmed to the protein level, included previously proposed OSCC markers, i.e., BAX, CDC2, and TP53, as well as multiple cancer-associated genes not considered for OSCC, e.g., BST2, CRIP1, ISG15, KLRC1, NEDD9, NNMT, and TWIST1. Elevation of p53 protein agreed with a missense mutation detectable in both the LK0412 line and the original tumor specimen. Moderate differentiation characterized the original tumor as well as tumors generated from inoculation of LK0412 in mice. Overall, the results suggest that the LK0412 cell line represent a subgroup of OSCC with unique genomic and phenotypic profiles. LK0412 should be useful to exploration of OSCC development, particularly the deregulated growth and differentiation responsiveness to serum factors",

    "Title": "Potent synergy of dual antitumor peptides for growth suppression of human glioblastoma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Molecular targeting agents have become formidable anticancer weapons, which show much promise against the refractory tumors. Functional peptides are among the more desirable of these nanobio-tools. Intracellular delivery of multiple functional peptides forms a basis for potent, non-invasive mode of delivery, providing distinctive therapeutic advantages. Here, we examine growth suppression efficiency of human glioblastomas by dual-peptide targeting. We did simultaneous introduction of two tumor suppressor peptides (p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) or p16(INK4a) and p21(CIP1) functional peptides) compared with single-peptide introduction using Wr-T-mediated peptide delivery. Wr-T-mediated transport of both p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) functional peptides (p14-1C and p16-MIS, respectively) into human glioblastoma cell line, U87DeltaEGFR, reversed specific loss of p14 and p16 function, thereby drastically inhibiting tumor growth by >95% within the first 72 h, whereas the growth inhibition was approximately 40% by p14 or p16 single-peptide introduction. Additionally, the combination of p16 and p21(CIP1) (p21-S154A) peptides dramatically suppressed the growth of glioblastoma line Gli36DeltaEGFR, which carries a missense mutation in p53, by >97% after 120 h. Significantly, our murine brain tumor model for dual-peptide delivery showed a substantial average survival enhancement (P < 0.0001) for peptide-treated mice. Wr-T-mediated dual molecular targeting using antitumor peptides is highly effective against growth of aggressive glioblastoma cells in comparison with single molecule targeting. Thus, jointly restoring multiple tumor suppressor functions by Wr-T-peptide delivery represents a powerful approach, with mechanistic implications for development of efficacious molecular targeting therapeutics against intractable human malignancies",

    "Abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the main obstacle to a successful chemotherapy of lung cancer. We tested the potential of sulfinosine and curcumin, alone and in combination, for modulating MDR in the human resistant, non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line (NCI-H460/R). First, we determined the mutational status of the p53 gene in NCI-H460/R cells by PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing and identified mutations which could at least partially contribute to the development of the MDR phenotype. The effects of sulfinosine and curcumin were studied, both separately and in combination, at the level of cytotoxicity, cell cycle distribution and gene expression. Sulfinosine displayed dose-dependent growth inhibition in both resistant and control sensitive cell lines, whereas curcumin considerably inhibited their growth only at relatively high doses. When sulfinosine was combined with a low dose of curcumin the drugs exerted a synergistic cytotoxic effect in NCI-H460/R cells. The expression of MDR-related genes mdr1, gst-pi and topo IIalpha, was altered by sulfinosine and curcumin. The most pronounced effect was observed when the agents were applied together. Sulfinosine and curcumin caused perturbations in cell cycle distribution in the NCI-H460/R cell line. The combination of the two drugs induced a more pronounced cell cycle arrest in S and G(2)/M in NCI-H460/R cells. Our results show that sulfinosine and curcumin overcome MDR in non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line (NSCLC), especially in combination despite the presence of a mutated p53 gene",

    "Abstract": "Malignant angiomyolipoma (AML) of the liver is rare. We report a case of AML with malignant transformation and metastases. A 30-year-old man had developed giant hepatic masses. Microscopically, the periphery of the tumor showed components of classic hepatic AML, but the central region contained atypical epithelioid components with extremely pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei with frequent mitotic figures. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the epithelioid cells were positive for HMB-45 and smooth muscle actin. Furthermore, the atypical epithelioid cells displayed P53 immunoreactivity and mutation at exon 7 for p53. The tumor showed a typical monoclonal pattern but no loss of heterozygosity or microsatellite instability. Markedly atypical epithelioid cells with vascular invasion, distant metastasis, and fatal outcome were interpreted as malignant characteristics of hepatic AML. It is suggested that large tumor size, pleomorphic nuclei with high proliferation activity, and P53 immunoreactivity may predict the existence of malignant transformation of hepatic AML",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most rapidly increasing cancers in Korea, but no comprehensive analysis has been performed to speculate the genetic basis of CRC development. We investigated the presence of adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC), Kirsten-ras (K-ras), p53, microsatellite instability (MSI), and melanoma antigen gene (MAGE) alterations in CRC and correlated the results obtained with clinical data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 78 cancer tissues from CRC patients. Genetic analyses were performed on APC, K-ras, p53, and MSI (BAT 25 and BAT 26), and in addition, MAGE expression was tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Correlations between genetic markers and clinical factors were analyzed after reviewing medical records. RESULT: The positive rates for alterations of APC, K-ras, p53, MSI, and MAGE in 78 tissue samples were 33.3, 29.5, 34.6, 9.0, and 68.4%, respectively. Mutations were frequently detected in codons 1291 and 1450 of APC, in codon 12 of K-ras and in codons 248, 282, and 176 of p53. APC mutations were frequently noted in early-stage cancer, whereas MSI was observed in right-sided and multiple cancers. No associations were found between the presence of alterations in APC, K-ras, p53, MSI, and MAGE. INTERPRETATION: In Koreans, positive rates of alterations in APC and p53 were slightly lower than those of APC and p53 in Caucasians, and the genetic alterations including MAGE expression are involved in 92.1% of CRCs. The lack of multiple mutations and of a relation between mutation rates and clinical stage suggest that genetic alterations might have independent influences on CRC development in Koreans",

    "Title": "Assessment of TP53 mutation using purified tissue samples of ovarian serous carcinomas reveals a higher mutation rate than previously reported and does not correlate with drug resistance",
    "Abstract": "The TP53 mutation frequency in ovarian serous carcinomas has been reported to range between 50% and 80%, but a stringent analysis of TP53 using purified epithelial samples has not yet been performed to accurately assess the mutation frequency and to correlate it with the histologic grade. The purpose of this study was to assess the TP53 mutational profile in a relatively large series of high-grade (53 primary and 18 recurrent) and 13 low-grade ovarian serous tumors using DNA isolated from affinity-purified tumor cells and to correlate it with in vitro drug resistance. All samples were affinity purified, and the tumor DNA was analyzed for TP53 mutations in exons 4-9. In vitro drug resistance assays to carboplatin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, and taxotere were performed on the same tumor samples and correlated with the TP53 mutation status. TP53 mutations were detected in 57 (80.3%) of 71 high-grade carcinomas and in one (7.8%) of 13 low-grade serous tumors (an invasive low-grade serous carcinoma). The mutations were predominantly missense mutations (59.6%). TP53 mutations were associated with high-grade serous carcinomas and recurrent disease (P < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant correlation between TP53 mutation status and drug resistance assays or clinical stage (P > 0.25). The frequency of TP53 mutations using purified tumor DNA from ovarian serous carcinomas was 80.3%, which is much higher than previously reported. Furthermore, we found that TP53 is not directly involved in the development of drug resistance in high-grade ovarian serous carcinomas",

    "Title": "Fragile histidine triad gene alterations are not essential for hepatocellular carcinoma development in South Korea",
    "Abstract": "AIM: To establish the role of FHIT in the pathogenesis hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We examined genomic alterations, as well as, mRNA and protein expression patterns from the FHIT gene, in 48 surgically resected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. Additionally, p53 mutations were analyzed. RESULTS: Aberrant FHIT transcripts were detected in 11 of 48 surrounding non-tumor liver tissues and 27 of 48 HCC samples (22.9% vs 56.3%, P = 0.002). No point mutations were identified within the open reading frame region of FHIT. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the FHIT locus was detected in 4 of 42 informative cases for D3S1300, and 3 of 29 informative cases for D3S1313. Reduced expression of FHIT protein (Fhit) was observed in 8 (16.7%) of 48 HCC samples, with complete loss of Fhit in only 1 case. There were no associations with abnormal transcripts, LOH, and Fhit expression. p53 mutations were identified in 9 of the 48 HCC cases. However, none of the cases displayed a G to T transversion at p53 codon 249. CONCLUSION: Aberrant FHIT transcripts were more common in HCC tissues as compared to non-cancerous liver tissues. However, Fhit expression was lost or reduced in a minor fraction of HCC tissues, while it was strongly expressed in non-cancerous liver tissues. Therefore, our study suggests that FHIT plays a role in relatively few HCC cases in South Korea",

    "Title": "High-resolution genomic and expression analyses of copy number alterations in breast tumors",
    "Abstract": "Analysis of recurrent DNA amplification can lead to the identification of cancer driver genes, but this process is often hampered by the low resolution of existing copy number analysis platforms. Fifty-one breast tumors were profiled for copy number alterations (CNAs) with the high-resolution Affymetrix 500K SNP array. These tumors were also expression-profiled and surveyed for mutations in selected genes commonly mutated in breast cancer (TP53, CDKN2A, ERBB2, KRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN). Combined analysis of common CNAs and mutations revealed putative associations between features. Analysis of both the prevalence and amplitude of CNAs defined regions of recurrent alteration. Compared with previous array comparative genomic hybridization studies, our analysis provided boundaries for frequently altered regions that were approximately one-fourth the size, greatly reducing the number of potential alteration-driving genes. Expression data from matched tumor samples were used to further interrogate the functional relevance of genes located in recurrent amplicons. Although our data support the importance of some known driver genes such as ERBB2, refined amplicon boundaries at other locations, such as 8p11-12 and 11q13.5-q14.2, greatly reduce the number of potential driver genes and indicate alternatives to commonly suggested driver genes in some cases. For example, the previously reported recurrent amplification at 17q23.2 is reduced to a 249 kb minimal region containing the putative driver RPS6KB1 as well as the putative oncogenic microRNA mir-21. High-resolution copy number analysis provides refined insight into many breast cancer amplicons and their relationships to gene expression, point mutations and breast cancer subtype classifications.

    "Title": "Shared TP53 gene mutation in morphologically and phenotypically distinct concurrent primary small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the prostate",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Small cell carcinoma of the prostate is an uncommon neoplasm, the origin of which has been controversial. To address this, we performed transcriptome profiling and TP53 sequencing of concurrent small cell and prostatic adenocarcinoma to determine the relationship between these entities. METHODS: We identified an unusual case of primary prostate cancer that contained adjacent acinar adenocarcinoma (Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7) and small cell carcinoma. We performed laser capture microdissection to isolate tumor components and performed gene expression and TP53 gene sequence analysis on each component, with results validated by immunohistochemistry for PSA, PSAP, PSMA, androgen receptor, NKX 3.1 and neuroendocrine markers. RESULTS: Transcriptome profiling of the carcinoma components identified 99 genes with a greater than 10-fold differential expression between prostatic adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma, many of which have not been previously reported in prostate cancer. The small cell carcinoma component demonstrated upregulation of proliferative and neuroendocrine markers and tyrosine kinase receptors, and downregulation of cell adhesion molecules, supporting the aggressive nature of this form of carcinoma. Sequencing of the TP53 gene suggested a common clonal origin for both components. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a primary small cell carcinoma of the prostate subjected to extensive molecular analysis and the first to show a clonal relation between two morphologically distinct prostate cancer types. The evidence of progression to small cell carcinoma may yield important insights into the pathogenesis of this entity and provide a novel spectrum of molecular markers to further dissect cellular pathways important in tumor progression",

    "Title": "Diagnostic value of fibronectin and mutant p53 in the urine of patients with bladder cancer: impact on clinicopathological features and disease recurrence",
    "Abstract": "Development of new methods for bladder cancer detection is required because cystoscopy is invasive, and voided urine cytology (VUC) has low sensitivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of urinary fibronectin and mutant p53 in comparison with VUC in the detection of bladder cancer. This study included 100 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer, 93 patients with benign urological disorders and 47 healthy volunteers. The urine supernatant was used for determination of fibronectin by ELISA, while urine sediment was used for cytology and detection of mutant p53 by PCR-SSCP followed by DNA sequencing. The sensitivity and specificity were 59% and 91.4% for VUC, 82% and 84.3% for fibronectin, and 37% and 100% for mutant p53; combination of the three parameters increased sensitivity to 95% but specificity was only 78.6%. A significant association was observed between disease recurrence and mutant p53, stage and lymph node involvement. Our results indicate that fibronectin had the highest sensitivity compared to VUC and mutant p53 in bladder cancer detection; however, mutant p53 had superior specificity compared to VUC and fibronectin. Mutant p53 is associated with disease recurrence and hence it has a significant prognostic role in bladder cancer",

    "Title": "Full sequencing of TP53 identifies identical mutations within in situ and invasive components in breast cancer suggesting clonal evolution",
    "Abstract": "In breast cancer, previous studies have suggested that somatic TP53 mutations are likely to be an early event. However, there are controversies regarding the cellular origin and linear course of breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate tumor evolution in breast cancer by analyzing TP53 mutation status in tumors from various stages of the disease. The entire coding sequence of TP53 was sequenced in a cohort of pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), pure invasive cancer (</=15mm) and mixed lesions (i.e. invasive cancer with an in situ component). Of 118 tumor samples, 19 were found to harbor a TP53 mutation; 5 (15.6%) of the pure DCIS, 4 (10.5%) of the pure invasive cancers and 10 (20.8%) of the mixed lesions. In the mixed lesions, both the invasive and the DCIS components showed the same mutation in all 5 cases where the two components were successfully microdissected. Presence of the same mutation in both DCIS and invasive components from the same tumor indicates same cellular origin. The role of mutant TP53 in the progression of breast cancer is less clear and may vary between subtypes",

    "Title": "Possible role of a radiation-induced p53 mutation in a Nelson's syndrome patient with a fatal outcome",
    "Abstract": "Nelson's syndrome (NS) is characterized by the appearance and/or progression of ACTH-secreting pituitary macroadenomas in patients who had previously undergone bilateral adrenalectomy for the treatment of Cushing's disease. Such corticotroph macroadenomas respond poorly to currently available therapeutic options which include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. P53 protein accumulation may be detected by immunohistochemistry in pituitary corticotroph adenomas and it has been suggested that it might be causally related to tumor development. Wild type P53 protein plays an important role in the cellular response to ionizing radiation and other DNA damaging agents and is mutated in many human tumors. In this study we report an adult male patient with NS who underwent both transsphenoidal and transcranial pituitary surgeries, conventional and stereotaxic radiotherapy and brachytherapy. Despite of the efforts to control tumor mass and growth, this macroadenoma displayed relentless growth and aggressive behavior. DNA extracted from the first two surgical samples, as well as DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes disclosed normal p53 sequence. DNA extracted from tumor samples obtained at surgeries performed after pituitary irradiation carried a somatic heterozygous mutation, consisting of a deletion of four cytosines between nucleotides 12,144-12,149 in exon 4 of the p53 gene. This frameshift mutation creates a stop codon in exon 4 excluding the expression of a functional protein from the defective allele. These data demonstrate a possible association between the P53 protein loss of function induced by radiotherapy and the aggressive course of the disease in this patient",

    "Title": "p73 tumor-suppressor activity is impaired in human thyroid cancer",
    "Abstract": "The p73 protein is a member of the p53 family and, like p53, can induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Because the loss of p53 function is responsible for the progression of well-differentiated thyroid cancer to more aggressive phenotypes, we hypothesized that p73 might also be involved in thyroid carcinogenesis. We find that normal thyrocites do not express p73, whereas most thyroid malignancies are positive for p73 expression. However, the p73 protein of thyroid cancer cells is unresponsive to DNA-damaging agents, failing to elicit a block of the cell cycle or an apoptotic response. Notably, overexpression of transcriptionally active p73 in thyroid cancer lines can arrest the cell cycle but is still unable to induce cell death. The loss of p73 biological activity in neoplastic thyroid cells is partly explained by its interaction with transcriptionally inactive variants of p73 (DeltaNp73) and with mutant p53. Our findings suggest that the functional impairment of p73 could be involved in the development of thyroid malignancies, defining p73 as a potential therapeutic target for thyroid cancer",

    "Title": "High frequency of TP53 mutation in BRCA1 and sporadic basal-like carcinomas but not in BRCA1 luminal breast tumors",
    "Abstract": "Breast tumors with a germ-line mutation of BRCA1 (BRCA1 tumors) and basal-like carcinoma (BLC) are associated with a high rate of TP53 mutation. Because BRCA1 tumors frequently display a basal-like phenotype, this study was designed to determine whether TP53 mutations are correlated with the hereditary BRCA1 mutated status or the particular phenotype of these tumors. The TP53 gene status was first investigated in a series of 35 BRCA1 BLCs using immunohistochemistry, direct sequencing of the coding sequence, and functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast, and compared with the TP53 status in a series of 38 sporadic (nonhereditary) BLCs. Using this sensitive approach, TP53 was found to be frequently mutated in both BRCA1 (34 of 35, 97%) and sporadic (35 of 38, 92%) BLCs. However, the spectrum of mutation was different, particularly with a higher rate of complex mutations, such as insertion/deletion, in BRCA1 BLCs than in the sporadic group [14 of 33 (42%) and 3 of 34 (9%), [corrected] respectively; P = 0.002]. Secondly, the incidence of TP53 mutations was analyzed in 19 BRCA1 luminal tumors using the same strategy. Interestingly, only 10 of these 19 tumors were mutated (53%), a frequency similar to that found in grade-matched sporadic luminal tumors. In conclusion, TP53 mutation is highly recurrent in BLCs independently of BRCA1 status, but not a common feature of BRCA1 luminal tumors",

    "Title": "p53-Altered FBXW7 expression determines poor prognosis in gastric cancer cases",
    "Abstract": "A molecular target associated with the progression of gastric cancer has not yet been uncovered. FBXW7 is a tumor suppressor gene transcriptionally controlled by p53 that plays a role in the regulation of cell cycle exit and reentry via c-Myc degradation. Few studies have addressed the clinical significance of FBXW7 expression in gastric cancer. Therefore, we examined FBXW7 mRNA expression to determine its clinicopathologic significance in 100 cases of gastric cancer. Low expression levels of FBXW7 in primary gastric cancer contributed to malignant potential, such as lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0012), tumor size (P = 0.0003), and poor prognosis (P = 0.018). In comparison with 52 cases of gastric cancer without the p53 mutation, 29 cases with the mutation exhibited lower expression levels of FBXW7 (P = 0.0034), revealing a significant relationship between p53 mutation and FBXW7 expression. Furthermore, we found that gastric cancer patients who had low FBXW7 expression levels and p53 mutation had a distinctively poor prognosis in comparison with other subgroups (P = 0.0033). In conclusion, we showed a role for p53 in the transcriptional regulation of FBXW7 expression in clinical gastric cancer cases and showed that disruption of both p53 and FBXW7 contributes to poor prognosis",

    "Abstract": "Inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 is central to carcinogenesis and acquisition of resistance to drug-induced apoptosis. The majority of alterations are missense mutations and occur within the DNA-binding domain. However, little is known about the point mutations in the tetramerization domain (TD). Here we investigated the properties of a new p53 mutant (Lys 351 to Asn) in the TD identified in a cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell line (A2780 CIS). We found that K351N substitution significantly reduces the thermodynamic stability of p53 tetramers without affecting the overall half-life of the protein. Moreover, p53 K351N has a reduced ability to bind DNA and to trans-activate its specific target gene promoters, such as bax. Data obtained from the analysis of p53 subcellular localization revealed that K351N mutation inhibits the nuclear export of p53 and accumulation in the cytoplasm induced by cisplatin treatment. These results identify p53 K351N as a new cancer associated mutant with reduced tumor suppressor activity and altered functions in response to apoptotic stimuli",

    "Abstract": "Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare neoplasm that accounts for only 1-3% of cases of primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid carcinoma is a well-differentiated tumor that is sometimes difficult to differentiate histopathologically from its benign counterpart, parathyroid adenoma. The molecular mechanism of parathyroid carcinogenesis remains unknown, and investigators have reported that abnormalities of the p53 gene do not play a significant role in parathyroid carcinogenesis, unlike in other human malignancies. The present report describes parathyroid carcinoma with anaplastic transformation of differentiated parathyroid carcinoma in a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism. Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein was found in anaplastic carcinoma cells but not in differentiated carcinoma cells. Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism followed by direct sequencing showed that anaplastic carcinoma cells carried a missense mutation at codon 248 (CGG to CAG) of the p53 gene, while the remaining differentiated carcinoma cells had the wild-type p53 gene. These findings suggest that the p53 gene mutation is associated with anaplastic transformation of parathyroid carcinoma",

    "Abstract": "Oligodendroglial tumors presenting loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 1p and 19q have been shown to be sensitive to chemotherapy, thus making 1p-19q status testing a key aspect in oligodendroglioma diagnosis and prognosis. Twenty-nine tumor samples (19 oligodendrogliomas, 10 oligoastrocytomas) were analyzed in order to obtain a molecular profile identifying those bearing 1p-19q LOH. Other genomic anomalies usually present in gliomas, such as EGFR amplification, CDKN2A/ARF deletion, 10q LOH and TP53 mutation, were also studied. Tumors with 1p-19q LOH overexpressed genes related to neurogenesis. Genes linked to immune response, proliferation and inflammation were overexpressed in the group with intact 1p-19q; this group could in turn be further divided in two subgroups: one overexpressing genes involved in immune response and inflammation that did not show major genetic aberrations other than the TP53 mutation and EGFR trisomy in a few cases, and another overexpressing genes related to immune response and proliferation that had a predominance of samples carrying several anomalies and presenting worse outcomes. This molecular signature was validated by analyzing a set of ten tumor samples (three oligodendrogliomas, seven oligoastrocytomas); all ten samples were correctly assigned. LOH at 1p-19q results in haploinsufficiency and copy number reduction of several genes, including NOTCH 2; this phenomenon produces a global change in gene expression inducing a pro-neural status that results in restrictions to cell migration and proliferation. Tumors without LOH at 1p-19q exhibit the opposite characteristics, explaining their more aggressive behavior",

Mutations in TP53, PTEN, PIK3CA, CTNNB1/beta-catenin genes and deletion of CDKN2A-ARF (p14(ARF)-p16(NK4a I) ) locus were investigated in sixteen primary primary effusion lymphoma tumors and seven primary effusion lymphoma cell lines using PCR and sequencing. TP53 mutations were detected in one primary primary effusion lymphoma tumor (6.2%) and two primary effusion lymphoma cell lines (28.6%). BC-3 and BCP-1 cell lines showed PTEN gene mutations, associated with a loss of PTEN protein expression in both cases. No mutations were detected in PIK3CA and CTNNB1/beta-catenin hotspot sequences. Only BC-3 contained a homozygous deletion of CDKN2A-ARF locus. Although detected at a higher frequency in primary effusion lymphoma cell lines than in primary primary effusion lymphoma tumors, TP53 and/or PTEN mutations, as well as deletion of CDKN2A-ARF locus are uncommon in primary effusion lymphoma, and are found to correlate with the EBV-negative status of primary effusion lymphoma tumors",

We established a new human MPNST cell line (designated FMS-1) from MPNST of the right brachial plexus of a 69-year-old woman with NF1.

FMS-1 cells showed a fibrosarcoma-like or epithelioid pattern in the heterotransplanted tumor, compared with a fascicular growth pattern of short-spindle tumor cells in the primary tumor. Immunophenotypically, FMS-1 cells showed almost the same characteristics as the primary tumor. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses revealed a deletion in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 were expressed in FMS-1 cells. To improve the highly aggressive course and poor prognosis and establish new therapeutic methods, molecular genetic and biological characterizations of MPNST are required. Thus, FMS-1 cells might be useful for investigating biological behaviors and developing new molecular-targeting antitumor drugs for MPNST expressing EGFR or COX-2",

    "Abstract": "The p53 gene is one of the most important genes involved in carcinogenesis and its role in part has been clarified by research using cell lines. To know the comprehensive characteristics of 22 hematopoietic cell lines (T, 13 and non-T, nine lines), the relationship between p53 mutational status, its altered functioning, and its mRNA and protein levels were examined. p53 mutations were less frequent in T-cell lines (38% vs. 78%) with mainly single nucleotide substitutions generating missense codons. Of 22 different p53 mutations, 12 (54.5%) resulted in mutated proteins, with the mutations clustering mainly in the sequence-specific DNA-binding site region located from amino acid residues 102 to 292. p53 mRNA and protein assays determined that wild-type cell lines expressed constant levels of both mRNA and protein, but mutated cell lines demonstrated two expression patterns: protein over-expression with reduced mRNA levels, because of missense mutations; and protein under-expression with little mRNA expression, because of other mutations. The resistance to Nutlin (MDM2 inhibitor)-induced apoptosis was associated with p53 mutations independently of MDM2 expression levels. This clarification of the unique associations in cell lines useful for bio-medical studies will contribute to a better understanding of p53-associated carcinogenesis",

    "Title": "Urothelial carcinoma following augmentation cystoplasty: an aggressive variant with distinct clinicopathological characteristics and molecular genetic alterations",
    "Abstract": "AIMS: Patients who have undergone intestinal augmentation cystoplasty are at risk for developing latent vesicle malignancy. The aim was to evaluate the histological and immunohistochemical characteristics and molecular genetic alterations in these neoplasms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four patients developing urothelial neoplasms after augmentation cystoplasty were included in the current study. The mean age of the patients, including two men and two women, was 37 years. The latency from bladder augmentation to developing malignancy ranged from 17 to 21 years (mean 19 years). All patients died of cancer shortly after diagnosis (mean 5 months). In the morphological evaluation, all tumours were high-grade (grade 3) invasive urothelial carcinoma comprising various architectural patterns with brisk mitoses and tumour necrosis. Three harboured glandular differentiation and the remaining one showed squamous differentiation. All cases revealed abnormal decreasing beta-catenin expression. Two tumours showed nuclear expression of CDX2. On UroVysion fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, all tumours displayed characteristic chromosomal abnormalities. Point mutations of both FGFR3 and p53 genes were identified in one case. CONCLUSIONS: Urothelial carcinomas developed after augmentation cystoplasty are extremely aggressive and exhibit distinct morphological, immunohistochemical and genetic characteristics. UroVysion FISH analysis may offer a surveillance strategy in patients who undergo augmentation cystoplasty",

    "Title": "Mutant p53 (G199V) gains antiapoptotic function through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells",
    "Abstract": "In the present study, we identified a missense mutation (G199V) in KAT-18 cell line established from primary cultures of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). Notably, knockdown of this mutant (mt) p53 reduced cell viability and exerted antitumor activity equivalent to high doses of several chemotherapeutic agents. We showed that p53 knockdown had an antitumor effect via the induction of apoptosis. We further examined the underlying mechanism by which mt p53 (G199V) gains antiapoptotic function in KAT-18 cells. Microarray analysis revealed that p53 knockdown modified the expression of numerous apoptosis-related genes. Importantly, p53 knockdown led to downregulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) gene expression. We further observed that p53 knockdown induced the downregulation of STAT3 protein. We also observed that a STAT3 inhibitor augmented the reduction of cell viability induced by p53 knockdown, whereas interleukin-6 treatment alleviated this effect. In addition, overexpression of STAT3 protected ATC cells against cell death induced by p53 knockdown. Taken together, these data show that mt p53 (G199V) gains antiapoptotic function mediated by STAT3 in ATC cells. Inhibition of the function of mt p53 (G199V) could be a novel and useful therapeutic strategy for decreasing the extent and severity of toxicity due to chemotherapeutic agents",

    "Title": "Two sporadic spinal neurofibromatosis patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour",
    "Abstract": "We analyzed two unrelated male patients in whom neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) was not suspected until they presented with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) in their thirties and forties, respectively. Patient A presented with progressive peroneus paresis due to a rapidly growing MPNST in the thigh. MRI examination revealed multiple symmetrical spinal neurofibromas in this patient as well as in patient B who presented at the age of 42 with paraparesis and an MPNST at spinal level L4. Dermal features in both patients were strikingly mild, therefore both patients were considered belonging to the NF1-subform of spinal neurofibromatosis (SNF). The novel NF1 mutations identified, i.e. splice mutation, c.7675+1G > A, in patient A and two alterations, p.Cys1016Arg and p.2711delVal, located in trans in patient B support the notion that the phenotype of SNF may be related to mutations with possible residual functionality. The MPNSTs of both patients showed LOH affecting chromosome 17 including the NF1 locus. Furthermore, a truncating TP53 mutation was identified in the tumour of patient A. Both alterations are frequent findings in NF1-associated MPNSTs. To our knowledge these are the first MPNST patients with the clinical phenotype of SNF. The clinical course observed in these two patients suggests that nodular plexiform neurofibromas and spinal-nerve-root neurofibromas which may be asymptomatic for a long time and, hence, unrecognized in SNF patients bear the risk for malignant transformation",

    "Title": "Establishment of ponasterone A-inducible the wild-type p53 protein-expressing clones from HSC-1 cells, cell growth suppression by p53 expression and the suppression mechanism",
    "Abstract": "Gene therapy for a variety of human cancers containing the mutant p53 (mt-p53) gene has been performed by direct injection of a retroviral or adenoviral vector containing the wild-type p53 (wt-p53) gene. Because many individuals with skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) have been shown to carry the p53 gene mutation, these patients are candidates for p53 gene therapy. For this reason, we established ponasterone A-inducible the wild-type p53 (wt-p53) protein-expressing clones by transfecting a ponasterone-inducible vector containing the wt-p53 gene into HSC-1 cells, which harbor the mutated p53 (m/w) at codon 173 (GTG --> TTG in one allele). Upon the induction of the wt-p53 protein, severe growth suppression was observed. Based on the results of the expression patterns of the p21, p16, RB, BAX and Bcl-2 proteins, as well as on the results of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining, the suppression was caused by senescence-like growth arrest of the cells. Although it is generally accepted that the suppression of tumor cell growth is caused by p53-induced apoptosis, permanent G1 arrest induced by p53 is also an important part of the growth-suppression mechanism in p53 gene therapy. The present results should expand the possibilities for p53 gene therapy for human skin SCCs containing the mutant p53 gene",

    "Title": "Comparison of cisplatin sensitivity and the 18F fluoro-2-deoxy 2 glucose uptake with proliferation parameters and gene expression in squamous cell carcinoma cell lines of the head and neck",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The survival of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer is still poor, with 5-year survival rates of 24-35%. The identification of prognostic and predictive markers at the molecular and cellular level could make it possible to find new therapeutic targets and provide 'taylor made' treatments. Established cell lines of human squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are valuable models for identifying such markers.The aim of this study was to establish and characterize a series of cell lines and to compare the cisplatin sensitivity and 18F fluoro-2 deoxy 2 glucose (18F-FDG) uptake of these cell lines with other cellular characteristics, such as proliferation parameters and TP53 and CCND1 status. METHODS: Explant cultures of fresh tumour tissue were cultivated, and six new permanent cell lines were established from 18 HNSCC cases. Successfully grown cell lines were analysed regarding clinical parameters, histological grade, karyotype, DNA ploidy, and index and S-phase fraction (Spf). The cell lines were further characterized with regard to their uptake of 18F-FDG, their sensitivity to cisplatin, as measured by a viability test (crystal violet), and their TP53 and CCND1 status, by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) with DNA sequencing and, for cyclin D1, by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Patients with tumours that could be cultured in vitro had shorter disease-free periods and overall survival time than those whose tumours did not grow in vitro, when analysed with the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Their tumours also showed more complex karyotypes than tumours from which cell lines could not be established. No correlation was found between TP53 or CCND1 status and 18F-FDG uptake or cisplatin sensitivity. However, there was an inverse correlation between tumour cell doubling time and 18F-FDG uptake. CONCLUSION: In vitro growth of HNSCC cells seem to be an independent prognostic factor, with cell lines being more readily established from aggressive tumours, a phenomenon more dependent on the molecular genetic characteristics of the tumour cells than on tumour location or TNM status",

    "Title": "Allelic loss of the PTEN gene and mutation of the TP53 gene in choriocarcinoma arising from gastric adenocarcinoma: analysis of loss of heterozygosity in two male patients with extragonadal choriocarcinoma",
    "Abstract": "A tumor suppressor gene at 10q23.3, designated PTEN, encoding a dual-specificity phosphatase with lipid and protein phosphatase activity, has been shown to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of a variety of human cancers. Frequent mutations and deletions of PTEN genes are found in cancer. Little is known, however, about the role that PTEN plays in the pathogenesis of a primary choriocarcinoma derived from gastric adenocarcinoma, an extremely rare choriocarcinoma, or in extragonadal retroperitoneal choriocarcinoma. In this study, genetic alterations occurring in extragonadal choriocarcinoma in two Japanese male patients were examined. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis using a polymorphic marker of the PTEN gene, IVS4+109ins/delTCTTA, revealed a hemizygous deletion of PTEN not only in the primary gastric choriocarcinoma, but also in the gastric adenocarcinoma. Microsatellite marker D12S1051 likewise showed LOH in both the primary gastric choriocarcinoma and the gastric adenocarcinoma. Mutational analysis of the TP53 gene revealed a point mutation in exon 5 (A536G), which resulted in H179R in the gastric choriocarcinoma but not in the gastric adenocarcinoma. No LOH was found for PTEN in an extragonadal retroperitoneal choriocarcinoma. Microsatellite marker D9S162 showed LOH in the extragonadal retroperitoneal choriocarcinoma, but not in the primary gastric choriocarcinoma. These results indicate that LOH of the PTEN gene and of D12S1051 is the molecular pathogenesis of the gastric adenocarcinoma, and the mutation of the TP53 gene is an additional hit for the oncogenesis of choriocarcinoma arising from gastric adenocarcinoma. However, LOH of the PTEN gene is not a common molecular event for pathogenesis of extragonadal choriocarcinoma. In addition, it was found that expression of PTEN is significantly decreased in the nuclei of syncytiotrophoblast-like cancer cells, compared with those of cytotrophoblast-like cancer cells in choriocarcinoma",

    "Title": "High incidence of MGMT promoter methylation in primary glioblastomas without correlation with TP53 gene mutations",
    "Abstract": "O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) reduces cytotoxicity of therapeutic or environmental alkylating agents. MGMT promoter methylation has been associated with TP53 G: C to A:T transition mutations in various types of cancers, and with poor prognosis in patients who did not receive chemotherapy. Mutations of TP53 are more frequent in secondary than in primary glioblastoma, thus the expected MGMT promoter methylation was low in primary glioblastoma. Glioblastoma patients with MGMT promoter methylation showed better response to chemotherapy based on alkylating agents and longer survival than patients without MGMT methylation. We examined 32 primary glioblastomas, treated with radiotherapy and surgery, for TP53 mutation by direct sequencing and MGMT promoter methylation by methylation-specific PCR. MGMT promoter methylation and TP53 mutations were detected in 72% and 31% of primary glioblastoma, respectively. Although not statistically significant, the frequency of TP53 G:C to A:T mutations were higher in cases with (26%) than without (11%) MGMT promoter methylation (p=0.376). MGMT promoter methylation had no impact on patient survival. Our data indicate that MGMT promoter methylation occurs frequently in primary glioblastoma, but does not lead to G:C to A:T TP53 mutations, has no independent prognostic value and is not a predictive marker unless glioblastoma patients are treated with chemotherapy",

We present a case of simultaneous double cancer of the gallbladder and bile duct. A 77-year-old woman who had jaundice, intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation and a space-occupying lesion in the gallbladder and lower bile duct underwent pancreatoduodenectomy. The gallbladder cancer showed papillary carcinoma without mutation of the K-ras gene and with p53 non-sense mutation of CCA (Pro) to CA (Stop) on codon 301 in exon 8. The bile duct cancer revealed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma without mutation of the K-ras gene and with p53 miss-sense mutation of GTG (Val) to GAG (Glu) on codon 272 in exon 8. There were no mutations of either the K-ras or p53 gene in non-cancerous epithelia. In contrast, only the mucosa of the common channel had p53 protein accumulation and high cell proliferation activity. Therefore, the genetic pathway might be the same in both the gallbladder and bile duct cancer, and a high potential for carcinogenesis might be present in the epithelium of the common channel in patients with PBM",

    "Abstract": "Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) has a broad spectrum of clinical behaviors; some cases are self-limited, whereas others involve multiple organs and cause significant mortality. Although Langerhans cells in LCH are clonal, their benign morphology and their lack (to date) of reported recurrent genomic abnormalities have suggested that LCH may not be a neoplasm. Here, using 2 orthogonal technologies for detecting cancer-associated mutations in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material, we identified the oncogenic BRAF V600E mutation in 35 of 61 archived specimens (57%). TP53 and MET mutations were also observed in one sample each. BRAF V600E tended to appear in younger patients but was not associated with disease site or stage. Langerhans cells stained for phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (phospho-MEK) and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (phospho-ERK) regardless of mutation status. High prevalence, recurrent BRAF mutations in LCH indicate that it is a neoplastic disease that may respond to RAF pathway inhibitors",

    "Title": "Systematic sequencing of renal carcinoma reveals inactivation of histone modifying genes",
    "Abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common form of adult kidney cancer, characterized by the presence of inactivating mutations in the VHL gene in most cases, and by infrequent somatic mutations in known cancer genes. To determine further the genetics of ccRCC, we have sequenced 101 cases through 3,544 protein-coding genes. Here we report the identification of inactivating mutations in two genes encoding enzymes involved in histone modification-SETD2, a histone H3 lysine 36 methyltransferase, and JARID1C (also known as KDM5C), a histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase-as well as mutations in the histone H3 lysine 27 demethylase, UTX (KMD6A), that we recently reported. The results highlight the role of mutations in components of the chromatin modification machinery in human cancer. Furthermore, NF2 mutations were found in non-VHL mutated ccRCC, and several other probable cancer genes were identified. These results indicate that substantial genetic heterogeneity exists in a cancer type dominated by mutations in a single gene, and that systematic screens will be key to fully determining the somatic genetic architecture of cancer",

Here we describe the genomic analyses of four DNA samples from an African-American patient with basal-like breast cancer: peripheral blood, the primary tumour, a brain metastasis and a xenograft derived from the primary tumour. The metastasis contained two de novo mutations and a large deletion not present in the primary tumour, and was significantly enriched for 20 shared mutations. The xenograft retained all primary tumour mutations and displayed a mutation enrichment pattern that resembled the metastasis. Two overlapping large deletions, encompassing CTNNA1, were present in all three tumour samples. The differential mutation frequencies and structural variation patterns in metastasis and xenograft compared with the primary tumour indicate that secondary tumours may arise from a minority of cells within the primary tumour",

    "Abstract": "The systematic characterization of somatic mutations in cancer genomes is essential for understanding the disease and for developing targeted therapeutics. Here we report the identification of 2,576 somatic mutations across approximately 1,800 megabases of DNA representing 1,507 coding genes from 441 tumours comprising breast, lung, ovarian and prostate cancer types and subtypes. We found that mutation rates and the sets of mutated genes varied substantially across tumour types and subtypes. Statistical analysis identified 77 significantly mutated genes including protein kinases, G-protein-coupled receptors such as GRM8, BAI3, AGTRL1 (also called APLNR) and LPHN3, and other druggable targets. Integrated analysis of somatic mutations and copy number alterations identified another 35 significantly altered genes including GNAS, indicating an expanded role for galpha subunits in multiple cancer types. Furthermore, our experimental analyses demonstrate the functional roles of mutant GNAO1 (a Galpha subunit) and mutant MAP2K4 (a member of the JNK signalling pathway) in oncogenesis. Our study provides an overview of the mutational spectra across major human cancers and identifies several potential therapeutic targets",

    "Title": "Frequent mutations of chromatin remodeling gene ARID1A in ovarian clear cell carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is an aggressive human cancer that is generally resistant to therapy. To explore the genetic origin of OCCC, we determined the exomic sequences of eight tumors after immunoaffinity purification of cancer cells. Through comparative analyses of normal cells from the same patients, we identified four genes that were mutated in at least two tumors. PIK3CA, which encodes a subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and KRAS, which encodes a well-known oncoprotein, had previously been implicated in OCCC. The other two mutated genes were previously unknown to be involved in OCCC: PPP2R1A encodes a regulatory subunit of serine/threonine phosphatase 2, and ARID1A encodes adenine-thymine (AT)-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A, which participates in chromatin remodeling. The nature and pattern of the mutations suggest that PPP2R1A functions as an oncogene and ARID1A as a tumor-suppressor gene. In a total of 42 OCCCs, 7% had mutations in PPP2R1A and 57% had mutations in ARID1A. These results suggest that aberrant chromatin remodeling contributes to the pathogenesis of OCCC",

    "Title": "Driver mutations in TP53 are ubiquitous in high grade serous carcinoma of the ovary",
    "Abstract": "Numerous studies have tested the association between TP53 mutations in ovarian cancer and prognosis but these have been consistently confounded by limitations in study design, methodology, and/or heterogeneity in the sample cohort. High-grade serous (HGS) carcinoma is the most clinically important histological subtype of ovarian cancer. As these tumours may arise from the ovary, Fallopian tube or peritoneum, they are collectively referred to as high-grade pelvic serous carcinoma (HGPSC). To identify the true prevalence of TP53 mutations in HGPSC, we sequenced exons 2-11 and intron-exon boundaries in tumour DNA from 145 patients. HGPSC cases were defined as having histological grade 2 or 3 and FIGO stage III or IV. Surprisingly, pathogenic TP53 mutations were identified in 96.7% (n = 119/123) of HGPSC cases. Molecular and pathological review of mutation-negative cases showed evidence of p53 dysfunction associated with copy number gain of MDM2 or MDM4, or indicated the exclusion of samples as being low-grade serous tumours or carcinoma of uncertain primary site. Overall, p53 dysfunction rate approached 100% of confirmed HGPSCs. No association between TP53 mutation and progression-free or overall survival was found. From this first comprehensive mapping of TP53 mutation rate in a homogeneous group of HGPSC patients, we conclude that mutant TP53 is a driver mutation in the pathogenesis of HGPSC cancers. Because TP53 mutation is almost invariably present in HGPSC, it is not of substantial prognostic or predictive significance. Copyright (c) 2010 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

All of the known pathogenic mutations (including point mutations and insertions/deletions of up to 16 nucleotides) were identified, using a combination of the Illumina data analysis pipeline with custom and commercial sequence alignment software. In our configuration, clonal sequencing outperforms current diagnostic methods, providing a reduction in analysis times and in reagent costs compared with conventional sequencing. These improvements open the possibility of BRCA1/2 testing for a wider spectrum of at-risk women, and will allow the genetic classification of tumors prior to the use of novel PARP inhibitors to treat BRCA-deficient breast cancers",

    "Title": "Profile of TP53 gene mutations in sinonasal cancer",
    "Abstract": "Genetic alterations underlying the development of the cancer of the nose and paranasal sinuses (sinonasal cancer, SNC), a rare cancer that can be included in the group of head and neck cancers, are still largely unknown. We recently reported that TP53 mutations are a common feature of SNC, with an overall frequency of 77%, and they show association to adenocarcinoma and wood-dust exposure [15]. In this study, we report in detail the sequence change for 159 TP53 mutations identified by direct sequencing. More than half of the mutations (60%, 95/159) were missense mutations; there were also 28 (18%) frameshift or nonsense mutations, and 36 (23%) intronic or silent mutations. In coding region, the most common base change detected was C-->T transition (43/125; 34% of base changes in the coding region). G-->T transversions occurred at a frequency of 10% (12/125), which is less than reported in mutation databases for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (24%). Characteristically, in our SNC series, the mutations were scattered over a large number of codons, codon 248 being the most frequent target of base substitution. Codon 135 was the second most frequently mutated codon; this nucleotide position has not been reported before as frequently mutated in head and neck cancer or human cancer in general. About half of all tumours with TP53 mutations carried more than one mutation. Interestingly, 86% (19/22) of the silent mutations detected had occurred in tumours with multiple mutations",

    "Title": "TP53 mutation profile of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas of patients from Southeastern Brazil",
    "Abstract": "Esophageal cancer (EC) is among the 10 most common and fatal malignacies in the world, presenting a marked geographic variation in incidence rates between and within different countries. The TP53 tumor suppressor gene is highly mutated in esophageal tumors and its mutation pattern can offer clues to the etiopathology of the tumor. As Brazil presents one of the highest incidence areas in the West, a deeper knowledge of the molecular mechanisms related to EC development in the Brazilian population is needed. We analyzed the mutation profile of 110 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) of patients from Southeastern Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo) and collected data regarding alcohol intake and tobacco smoking. We detected 41 mutations in tumor samples from 38 patients. There was no association between mutation frequency and tobacco smoking or alcohol drinking. The most frequently mutated codons were 179, 214, 220 and 248. Codons 179, 220 and 248 are hot-spots for ESCC, but codon 214 presents only 0.7% of the mutations registered in the IARC database. The mutation profile revealed a high percentage of mutations at A:T base pairs (34.1%) followed by deletions (17.1%). We concluded that the mutation profile detected in this study is different from that of patients from Southern Brazil but very similar to that previously seen in French patients, being characterized by a high frequency of mutations at A:T base pairs, which may be associated with acetaldehyde, the metabolic product of ethanol",

    "Title": "Subtype-specific genomic alterations define new targets for soft-tissue sarcoma therapy",
    "Abstract": "Soft-tissue sarcomas, which result in approximately 10,700 diagnoses and 3,800 deaths per year in the United States, show remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes. However, knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. We describe an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Frequently mutated genes included TP53 (17% of pleomorphic liposarcomas), NF1 (10.5% of myxofibrosarcomas and 8% of pleomorphic liposarcomas) and PIK3CA (18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, or MRCs). PIK3CA mutations in MRCs were associated with Akt activation and poor clinical outcomes. In myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, we found both point mutations and genomic deletions affecting the tumor suppressor NF1. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based knockdown of several genes amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation. Our study yields a detailed map of molecular alterations across diverse sarcoma subtypes and suggests potential subtype-specific targets for therapy",

    "Title": "Radiosensitivity profiles from a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines exhibiting genetic alterations in p53 and disparate DNA-dependent protein kinase activities",
    "Abstract": "The variability of radiation responses in ovarian tumors and tumor-derived cell lines is poorly understood. Since both DNA repair capacity and p53 status can significantly alter radiation sensitivity, we evaluated these factors along with radiation sensitivity in a panel of sporadic human ovarian carcinoma cell lines. We observed a gradation of radiation sensitivity among these sixteen lines, with a five-fold difference in the LD50 between the most radiosensitive and the most radioresistant cells. The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is essential for the repair of radiation induced DNA double-strand breaks in human somatic cells. Therefore, we measured gene copy number, expression levels, protein abundance, genomic copy and kinase activity for DNA-PK in all of our cell lines. While there were detectable differences in DNA-PK between the cell lines, there was no clear correlation with any of these differences and radiation sensitivity. In contrast, p53 function as determined by two independent methods, correlated well with radiation sensitivity, indicating p53 mutant ovarian cancer cells are typically radioresistant relative to p53 wild-type lines. These data suggest that the activity of regulatory molecules such as p53 may be better indicators of radiation sensitivity than DNA repair enzymes such as DNA-PK in ovarian cancer",

    "Title": "Transcriptome analysis reveals that p53 and {beta}-catenin alterations occur in a group of aggressive adrenocortical cancers",
    "Abstract": "Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare disease with an overall poor but heterogeneous prognosis. This heterogeneity could reflect different mechanisms of tumor development. Gene expression profiling by transcriptome analysis led to ACC being divided into two groups of tumors with very different outcomes. Somatic inactivating mutations of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 and activating mutations of the proto-oncogene beta-catenin (CTNNB1) are the most frequent mutations identified in ACC. This study investigates the correlation between p53 and beta-catenin alterations and the molecular classification of ACC by transcriptome analysis of 51 adult sporadic ACCs. All TP53 and CTNNB1 mutations seemed to be mutually exclusive and were observed only in the poor-outcome ACC group. Most of the abnormal p53 and beta-catenin immunostaining was also found in this group. Fifty-two percent of the poor-outcome ACC group had TP53 or CTNNB1 mutations and 60% had abnormal p53 or beta-catenin immunostaining. Unsupervised clustering transcriptome analysis of this poor-outcome group revealed three different subgroups, two of them being associated with p53 or beta-catenin alterations, respectively. Analysis of p53 and beta-catenin target gene expressions in each cluster confirmed a profound and anticipated effect on tumor biology, with distinct profiles logically associated with the respective pathway alterations. The third group had no p53 or beta-catenin alteration, suggesting other unidentified molecular defects. This study shows the important respective roles of p53 and beta-catenin in ACC development, delineating subgroups of ACC with different tumorigenesis and outcomes",

    "Title": "Prevalence of human papillomavirus 16/18/33 infection and p53 mutation in lung adenocarcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a causative event for the development of uterine cervical carcinoma. Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16, 18, and 33 DNA has been also detected frequently in lung adenocarcinomas (AdCs) in East Asian countries; however, its prevalence in Japan remains unclear. We therefore screened for HPV 16/18/33 DNA in 297 lung AdCs in a Japanese population by multiplex PCR with type-specific primers. As reported previously, HPV 16 DNA was detected in two cervical cancer cell lines, CaSki and SiHa, while HPV 18 DNA was detected in HeLa cells, and 0.1-1.0 copies of HPV-DNA per cell were detectable by this method. However, with this method, none of the 297 lung AdCs showed positive signals for HPV 16/18/33 DNA, indicating that HPV-DNA is not or is very rarely integrated in lung AdC genomes in the Japanese. Furthermore, none of the lung AdCs showed positive signals by nested PCR with HPV 16/18 type-specific primers. Therefore, we further attempted to detect HPV 16/18/33 DNA in 91 lung cancer cell lines, including 40 AdC cell lines. Among them, 30 have been established in Japan and the remaining 61 in the USA. No HPV signals were obtained in any of the 91 cell lines by either multiplex or nested PCR, while the p53 gene was mutated in 81 of them including 35 of the 40 AdC cell lines. These results indicate that HPV 16/18/33 infection does not play a major role in the development of lung AdC in Japan nor in the USA",

    "Title": "Coexpression and nuclear colocalization of metastasis-promoting protein S100A4 and p53 without mutual regulation in colorectal carcinoma",
    "Abstract": "Nuclear localization of the metastasis-associated protein S100A4 has been shown to correlate with advanced disease stage in primary colorectal carcinomas (CRC), but nuclear function and its relevance for the metastatic capacity of tumor cells is still unclear. Among several nuclear interacting protein partners suggested for S100A4, the tumor suppressor protein p53 has attracted particular interest, and previous studies suggest direct and indirect modes of interaction between the two proteins. The present study was undertaken to assess coexpression and potential interaction in CRC. TP53 mutational status and S100A4 expression were investigated in a selected series of primary CRC specimens (n = 40) and cell lines (n = 17) using DNA sequencing, western blot, and double immunostaining. Additionally, S100A4 and p53 were experimentally up- and down-regulated in vitro to assess reciprocal effects. For the first time, S100A4 and p53 coexpression was demonstrated in individual CRC cells, with nuclear colocalization as a particularly interesting feature. In contrast to previous studies, no correlation was observed between TP53 mutational status and S100A4 expression, and no evidence was obtained to support reciprocal regulation between the two molecules in the HCT116 isogenic cell line model. In conclusion, S100A4 and p53 were shown to be colocalized in individual nuclei of CRC cells, and it might be speculated whether the proteins interact in this subcellular compartment",

    "Abstract": "Renal-cell carcinomas (RCC) are frequent in central and eastern Europe and the reasons remain unclear. Molecular mechanisms, except for VHL, have not been much investigated. We analysed 361 RCCs (334 clear-cell carcinomas) from a multi-centre case-control study for mutations in TP53 (exons 5-9 in the whole series and exons 4 and 10 in a pilot subset of 60 tumours) and a pilot 50 tumours for mutations in EGFR (exons 18-21) or KRAS (codon 12) in relation to VHL status. TP53 mutations were detected in 4% of clear-cell cases, independently of VHL mutations. In non-clear-cell carcinomas, they were detected in 11% of VHL-wild-type tumours and in 0% of tumours with VHL functional mutations. No mutations were found in EGFR or KRAS. We conclude that mutations in TP53, KRAS, or EGFR are not major contributors to the RCC development even in the absence of VHL inactivation. The prevalence of TP53 mutations in relation to VHL status may differ between clear-cell and other renal carcinomas",

    "Title": "Stemness markers characterize IGR-CaP1, a new cell line derived from primary epithelial prostate cancer",
    "Abstract": "Deciphering molecular pathways involved in the early steps of prostate oncogenesis requires both in vitro and in vivo models derived from human primary tumors. However the few recognized models of human prostate epithelial cancer originate from metastases. To date, very few models are proposed from primary tumors and immortalizing normal human prostate cells does not recapitulate the natural history of the disease. By culturing human prostate primary tumor cells onto human epithelial extra-cellular matrix, we successfully selected a new prostate cancer cell line, IGR-CaP1, and clonally-derived subclones. IGR-CaP1 cells, that harbor a tetraploid karyotype, high telomerase activity and mutated TP53, rapidly induced subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. Furthermore, IGR-CaP1 cell lines, all exhibiting negativity for the androgen receptor and PSA, express the specific prostate markers alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase and a low level of the prostate-specific membrane antigen PSMA, along with the prostate basal epithelial markers CK5 and CK14. More importantly, these clones express high CD44, CD133, and CXCR4 levels associated with high expression of alpha2beta1-integrin and Oct4 which are reported to be prostate cancer stemness markers. RT-PCR data also revealed high activation of the Sonic Hedgehog signalling pathway in these cells. Additionally, the IGR-CaP1 cells possess a 3D sphere-forming ability and a renewal capacity by maintaining their CSC potential after xenografting in mice. As a result, the hormone-independent IGR-CaP1 cellular clones exhibit the original features of both basal prostate tissue and cancer stemness. Tumorigenic IGR-CaP1 clones constitute invaluable human models for studying prostate cancer progression and drug assessment in vitro as well as in animals specifically for developing new therapeutic approaches targeting prostate cancer stem cells",

    "Abstract": "The WHO 2004 classification defines new histological and molecular variants of urothelial carcinoma. However, there are limited data available on the clinicopathological characteristics or prognosis of these variants. We present histopathological, molecular and clinical data of 32 plasmacytoid carcinomas of the bladder (PUC) showing that PUC is a high-grade tumor with molecular features of aggressive urothelial carcinoma, usually diagnosed in advanced pathological stage (64% pT3, 23% pT4) showing metastases in 60% of the patients. Average survival of our cohort of PUC treated with radical cystectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy was lower than what is typically seen for comparable conventional urothelial carcinomas. Eighty-seven percent of the PUCs showed a negative or strongly reduced membranous staining of E-cadherin. beta-Catenin staining was negative in 22.5%, and 16.7% of the remaining tumors showed nuclear accumulation. Aberrant CK20 expression (negative or >10% of cells stained) and negative CK7 staining was found in 100% and 22.6%, respectively. Ninety-seven percent revealed positive staining for PAN-CK. CD138 was positive in 78%, whereas MUM-1 expression was negative in all cases. Multitarget fluorescence in situ hybridization showed all PUCs to be highly aneuploid and polysomic. Deletions on chromosome 9p21 seem to play an important role in this variant. FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutation analyses yielded no mutations in any of the PUCs analyzed. TP53 mutation analysis showed mutations in 29%. In summary, PUC is an aggressive variant of bladder cancer with molecular features of advanced bladder cancer and evidence of WNT pathway activation in some of the cases",

    "Abstract": "Hypermethylation of the MGMT gene promoter and mutation of the TP53 tumor-suppressor gene are frequently present in diffuse astrocytomas. However, there is only anecdotal information about MGMT methylation status and TP53 mutations during progression of low-grade diffuse astrocytoma (AII) to anaplastic astrocytoma (AIII) and secondary glioblastoma (sGB). In this study biopsy specimens from 51 patients with astrocytic tumors with radiologically proved progression from low to high-grade malignancy were investigated for the presence and consistency of MGMT promoter hypermethylation and TP53 mutations. For 27 patients biopsy samples both of primary tumors and their recurrences were available. For the other 24 patients histology of either the low-grade lesion or the high-grade recurrence was available. It was found that MGMT promoter hypermethylation and TP53 mutations are both frequent and early events in the progression of astrocytomas and that their status is consistent over time. No correlation was found between MGMT methylation status and the presence of TP53 mutations. In addition, no correlation was found between MGMT promoter hypermethylation and the type of TP53 mutations. These results argue against the putative TP53 G:C>A:T transition mutations suggested to occur preferentially in MGMT hypermethylated tumors",

    "Abstract": "Thirteen human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines were established from 10 primary tumors and 3 metastatic tumors obtained from 13 Korean patients. Characteristics of the cell lines including morphology in vivo and in vitro; mutations of the K-ras, p53, APC and MMR genes and microsatellite instability (MSI) status in vitro were determined. Expression of drug-sensitivity genes including MDR1, MXR, MRP1 and COX2 was also analyzed. The cell lines were unique as judged by DNA fingerprinting using 16 short tandem repeats. Eleven of the cell lines grew as adherent populations and the remaining two as floating aggregates. None of the cell lines were contaminated with Mycoplasma or bacteria. All cell lines showed high viability with relatively long doubling times. Six cell lines contained mutations at K-ras. Seven cell lines displayed p53 gene missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations. MSI was found in three cell lines and two cell lines with an MSI-high phenotype-possessed hMLH1 mutations. Nine cell lines had an APC mutation. MRP1 was highly expressed in all cell lines, and high expression of MDR1, MXR and COX2 evident in eight, six and six cell lines, respectively. Embryonal stem cell markers (MELK, SOX4 and OCT4) were expressed in most of cell lines. The cancer stem cell biomarkers CD133, CD44 and Lgr5 were expressed in 12, 13 and 13 cell lines, respectively. The presently well-characterized CRC cell lines should be useful in investigations of the biological characteristics of CRC, particularly for investigations related to gene alterations associated with CRC and biology of cancer stem cells",

    "Abstract": "Cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract [(UADT): oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and oesophagus] have high incidence rates in some parts of South America. Alterations in the TP53 gene are common in these cancers. In our study, we have estimated the prevalence and patterns of TP53 mutations (exons 4-10) in 236 UADT tumours from South America in relation to lifestyle risk factors, such as tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking. Moreover, we have conducted a pilot study of EGFR mutations (exons 18-21) in 45 tumours from the same population. TP53 mutation prevalence was high: 59% of tumours were found to carry mutant TP53. We found an association between TP53 mutations and tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking. The mutation rate increased from 38% in never-smokers to 66% in current smokers (P-value for trend = 0.09). G:C>T:A transversions were found only in smokers (15%). Alcohol drinkers carried more G:C>A:T transitions (P = 0.08). Non-exposed individuals were more probable to carry G:C>A:T transitions at CpG sites (P = 0.01 for never-smokers and P < 0.001 for never-drinkers). EGFR mutations were found in 4% of cases. Inactivation of TP53 by mutations is a crucial molecular event in the UADT carcinogenesis and it is closely related to exposure to lifestyle risk factors. EGFR mutations do not appear to be a common event in UADT carcinogenesis in this population",

    "Title": "Sensitivity of cancer cells to Plk1 inhibitor GSK461364A is associated with loss of p53 function and chromosome instability",
    "Abstract": "Polo-like kinases are a family of serine threonine kinases that are critical regulators of cell cycle progression and DNA damage response. Predictive biomarkers for the Plk1-selective inhibitor GSK461364A were identified by comparing the genomics and genetics of a panel of human cancer cell lines with their response to a drug washout followed by an outgrowth assay. In this assay, cell lines that have lost p53 expression or carry mutations in the TP53 gene tended to be more sensitive to GSK461364A. These more sensitive cell lines also had increased levels of chromosome instability, a characteristic associated with loss of p53 function. Further mechanistic studies showed that p53 wild-type (WT) and not mutant cells can activate a postmitotic tetraploidy checkpoint and arrest at pseudo-G(1) state after GSK461364A treatment. RNA silencing of WT p53 increased the antiproliferative activity of GSK461364A. Furthermore, silencing of p53 or p21/CDKN1A weakened the tetraploidy checkpoint in cells that survived mitotic arrest and mitotic slippage. As many cancer therapies tend to be more effective in p53 WT patients, the higher sensitivity of p53-deficient tumors toward GSK461364A could potentially offer an opportunity to treat tumors that are refractory to other chemotherapies as well as early line therapy for these genotypes",

METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tumor tissue and the corresponding HGG-02 cell line derived from this tumor were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), G-banding, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast (FASAY), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunocytochemistry (ICC). RESULTS: Mutation of the p53 gene and hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene were detected by FASAY and MLPA, respectively. Cytogenetic analysis showed a polyploid karyotype with extensive heterogeneity in chromosome number. Using FISH, we identified a very unusual genetic change - a loss of EGFR gene copy in both the tumor tissue and the HGG-02 cell line. In accordance with the cytogenetic findings, IHC and ICC did not demonstrate overexpression of EGFR in the tumor tissue or HGG-02 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Despite his very poor prognosis, the patient experienced 34 months of event-free survival after surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The detected loss of the EGFR gene copy may contribute to the unusual biological features of this tumor, but the forthcoming detailed expression analysis of cancer regulatory pathways is necessary to better understand this tumor phenotype",

    "Title": "Fetal colon cell line FHC exhibits tumorigenic phenotype, complex karyotype, and TP53 gene mutation",
    "Abstract": "Stable cell lines obtained by spontaneous immortalization might represent early stages of malignant transformation and be useful experimental models for studies of mechanisms of cancer development. The FHC (fetal human cells) cell line has been established from normal fetal colonic mucosa. Detailed characterization of this cell line and mechanism of spontaneously acquired immortality have not been described yet. Therefore, we characterized the FHC cell line in terms of its tumorigenicity, cytogenetics, and TP53 gene mutation analysis. FHC cells displayed capability for anchorage-independent growth in semisolid media in vitro and formed solid tumors after transplantation into SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice. This tumorigenic phenotype was associated with hypotriploidy and chromosome number ranging from 66 to 69. Results of comparative genetic hybridization arrays showed that most chromosomes included regions of copy number gains or losses. Region 8q23 approximately 8q24.3 (containing, e.g., MYC proto-oncogene) was present in more than 20 copies per nucleus. Moreover, we identified mutation of TP53 gene in codon 273; triplet CGT coding Arg was changed to CAG coding His. Expression of Pro codon 72 polymorphic variant of p53 was also detected. Mutation of TP53 gene was associated with abolished induction of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and MDM-2 proteins and resistance to apoptosis after genotoxic treatment. Because of their origin from normal fetal colon and their relative resistance to the induction of apoptosis, FHC cells can be considered a valuable experimental model for various studies",

    "Title": "Distinct gene mutation profiles among luminal-type and basal-type breast cancer cell lines",
    "Abstract": "Breast cancer has for long been recognized as a highly diverse tumor group, but the underlying genetic basis has been elusive. Here, we report an extensive molecular characterization of a collection of 41 human breast cancer cell lines. Protein and gene expression analyses indicated that the collection of breast cancer cell lines has retained most, if not all, molecular characteristics that are typical for clinical breast cancers. Gene mutation analyses identified 146 oncogenic mutations among 27 well-known cancer genes, amounting to an average of 3.6 mutations per cell line. Mutations in genes from the p53, RB and PI3K tumor suppressor pathways were widespread among all breast cancer cell lines. Most important, we have identified two gene mutation profiles that are specifically associated with luminal-type and basal-type breast cancer cell lines. The luminal mutation profile involved E-cadherin and MAP2K4 gene mutations and amplifications of Cyclin D1, ERBB2 and HDM2, whereas the basal mutation profile involved BRCA1, RB1, RAS and BRAF gene mutations and deletions of p16 and p14ARF. These subtype-specific gene mutation profiles constitute a genetic basis for the heterogeneity observed among human breast cancers, providing clues for their underlying biology and providing guidance for targeted pharmacogenetic intervention in breast cancer patients",

    "Title": "Molecular characterization of commonly used cell lines for bone tumor research: a trans-European EuroBoNet effort",
    "Abstract": "Usage of cancer cell lines has repeatedly generated conflicting results provoked by differences among subclones or contamination with mycoplasm or other immortal mammalian cells. To overcome these limitations, we decided within the EuroBoNeT consortium to characterize a common set of cell lines including osteosarcomas (OS), Ewing sarcomas (ES), and chondrosarcomas (CS). DNA fingerprinting was used to guarantee the identity of all of the cell lines and to distinguish subclones of osteosarcoma cell line HOS. Screening for homozygous loss of 38 tumor suppressor genes by MLPA revealed deletion of CDKN2A as the most common event (15/36), strictly associated with absence of the CDKN2A (p16) protein. Ten cell lines showed missense mutations of the TP53 gene while another set of nine cell lines showed mutations resulting in truncation of the TP53 protein. Cells harboring missense mutations expressed high levels of nuclear TP53, while cell lines with nonsense mutations showed weak/absent staining for TP53. TP53(wt) cell lines usually expressed the protein in 2-10% of the cells. However, seven TP53(wt) osteosarcomas were negative for both mRNA and protein expression. Our analyses shed light on the correlation between immunohistochemical and genetic data for CDKN2A and TP53, and confirm the importance of these signaling pathways. The characterization of a substantial number of cell lines represents an important step to supply research groups with proven models for further advanced studies on tumor biology and may help to make results from different laboratories more comparable",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in TP53 underlie the development of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) in animal models, but there is controversy regarding the extent of TP53 mutations in human MPNSTs. We assessed the TP53 mutation frequency in 145 consecutive cases from our department over 36 years; 88 cases were histologically confirmed as MPNSTs, and corresponding clinical data were reviewed. Mutation analysis of TP53 Exons 4 to 9 on DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens was performed by bidirectional DNA sequencing. Tumors were localized in the extremities (n = 34), trunk (n = 34), or head and neck (n = 20). A minority of patients (n = 26, 30%) had neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1); in these patients, the diagnosis of MPNST was made at younger ages (33 [SD, 3.6] years vs 49 [SD, 2.9] years in NF1 vs non-NF1; p = 0.003). High p53 protein expression was detected in 18 (21%) of 86 cases by immunohistochemistry. TP53 mutations were detected in 17 (24%) of 72 evaluable tumors, of which 36% were from NF1 patients. TP53 mutation and strong p53 immunostaining were positively correlated (p = 0.002); high proliferation indices correlated with cellular epithelioid and storiform growth patterns. These results indicate that TP53 mutations are relatively rare in human MPNST and that they are not positively correlated with the presence of NF1",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are a rare but clinically important form of pancreatic neoplasia. To explore the genetic basis of PanNETs, we determined the exomic sequences of 10 nonfamilial PanNETs and then screened the most commonly mutated genes in 58 additional PanNETs. The most frequently mutated genes specify proteins implicated in chromatin remodeling: 44% of the tumors had somatic inactivating mutations in MEN1, which encodes menin, a component of a histone methyltransferase complex, and 43% had mutations in genes encoding either of the two subunits of a transcription/chromatin remodeling complex consisting of DAXX (death-domain-associated protein) and ATRX (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked). Clinically, mutations in the MEN1 and DAXX/ATRX genes were associated with better prognosis. We also found mutations in genes in the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway in 14% of the tumors, a finding that could potentially be used to stratify patients for treatment with mTOR inhibitors",

    "Abstract": "Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor of children. To identify the genetic alterations in this tumor type, we searched for copy number alterations using high-density microarrays and sequenced all known protein-coding genes and microRNA genes using Sanger sequencing in a set of 22 MBs. We found that, on average, each tumor had 11 gene alterations, fewer by a factor of 5 to 10 than in the adult solid tumors that have been sequenced to date. In addition to alterations in the Hedgehog and Wnt pathways, our analysis led to the discovery of genes not previously known to be altered in MBs. Most notably, inactivating mutations of the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase genes MLL2 or MLL3 were identified in 16% of MB patients. These results demonstrate key differences between the genetic landscapes of adult and childhood cancers, highlight dysregulation of developmental pathways as an important mechanism underlying MBs, and identify a role for a specific type of histone methylation in human tumorigenesis",

To uncover its mutational spectrum, we analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 74 tumor-normal pairs. The majority exhibited a mutational profile consistent with tobacco exposure; human papillomavirus was detectable by sequencing DNA from infected tumors. In addition to identifying previously known HNSCC genes (TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, PIK3CA, and HRAS), our analysis revealed many genes not previously implicated in this malignancy. At least 30% of cases harbored mutations in genes that regulate squamous differentiation (for example, NOTCH1, IRF6, and TP63), implicating its dysregulation as a major driver of HNSCC carcinogenesis. More generally, the results indicate the ability of large-scale sequencing to reveal fundamental tumorigenic mechanisms",

To explore the genetic origins of this cancer, we used whole-exome sequencing and gene copy number analyses to study 32 primary tumors. Tumors from patients with a history of tobacco use had more mutations than did tumors from patients who did not use tobacco, and tumors that were negative for human papillomavirus (HPV) had more mutations than did HPV-positive tumors. Six of the genes that were mutated in multiple tumors were assessed in up to 88 additional HNSCCs. In addition to previously described mutations in TP53, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, and HRAS, we identified mutations in FBXW7 and NOTCH1. Nearly 40% of the 28 mutations identified in NOTCH1 were predicted to truncate the gene product, suggesting that NOTCH1 may function as a tumor suppressor gene rather than an oncogene in this tumor type",

    "Title": "A systematic study of gene mutations in urothelial carcinoma; inactivating mutations in TSC2 and PIK3R1",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is characterized by frequent gene mutations of which activating mutations in FGFR3 are the most frequent. Several downstream targets of FGFR3 are also mutated in UC, e.g., PIK3CA, AKT1, and RAS. Most mutation studies of UCs have been focused on single or a few genes at the time or been performed on small sample series. This has limited the possibility to investigate co-occurrence of mutations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed mutation analyses of 16 genes, FGFR3, PIK3CA, PIK3R1 PTEN, AKT1, KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, BRAF, ARAF, RAF1, TSC1, TSC2, APC, CTNNB1, and TP53, in 145 cases of UC. We show that FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutations are positively associated. In addition, we identified PIK3R1 as a target for mutations. We demonstrate a negative association at borderline significance between FGFR3 and RAS mutations, and show that these mutations are not strictly mutually exclusive. We show that mutations in BRAF, ARAF, RAF1 rarely occurs in UC. Our data emphasize the possible importance of APC signaling as 6% of the investigated tumors either showed inactivating APC or activating CTNNB1 mutations. TSC1, as well as TSC2, that constitute the mTOR regulatory tuberous sclerosis complex were found to be mutated at a combined frequency of 15%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data demonstrate a significant association between FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutations in UC. Moreover, the identification of mutations in PIK3R1 further emphasizes the importance of the PI3-kinase pathway in UC. The presence of TSC2 mutations, in addition to TSC1 mutations, underlines the involvement of mTOR signaling in UC",

    "Abstract": "Advanced prostate cancer can progress to systemic metastatic tumors, which are generally androgen insensitive and ultimately lethal. Here, we report a comprehensive genomic survey for somatic events in systemic metastatic prostate tumors using both high-resolution copy number analysis and targeted mutational survey of 3508 exons from 577 cancer-related genes using next generation sequencing. Focal homozygous deletions were detected at 8p22, 10q23.31, 13q13.1, 13q14.11, and 13q14.12. Key genes mapping within these deleted regions include PTEN, BRCA2, C13ORF15, and SIAH3. Focal high-level amplifications were detected at 5p13.2-p12, 14q21.1, 7q22.1, and Xq12. Key amplified genes mapping within these regions include SKP2, FOXA1, and AR. Furthermore, targeted mutational analysis of normal-tumor pairs has identified somatic mutations in genes known to be associated with prostate cancer including AR and TP53, but has also revealed novel somatic point mutations in genes including MTOR, BRCA2, ARHGEF12, and CHD5. Finally, in one patient where multiple independent metastatic tumors were available, we show common and divergent somatic alterations that occur at both the copy number and point mutation level, supporting a model for a common clonal progenitor with metastatic tumor-specific divergence. Our study represents a deep genomic analysis of advanced metastatic prostate tumors and has revealed candidate somatic alterations, possibly contributing to lethal prostate cancer",

    "Title": "TP53 Mutational signature for aristolochic acid: an environmental carcinogen",
    "Abstract": "This study was designed to establish the TP53 mutational spectrum of aristolochic acid (AA), examined in the context of endemic (Balkan) nephropathy, an environmental disease associated with transitional cell (urothelial) carcinomas of the upper urinary tract (UUC). Tumor tissue was obtained from residents of regions in Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia where endemic nephropathy has been prevalent for over 50 years. Fifty-nine TP53 mutations were detected in 42 of the 97 tumors analyzed. Mutational spectra were dominated by A:T to T:A transversions with the mutated adenines located almost exclusively on the nontranscribed strand. This marked strand bias is attributed to selective processing of aristolactam-dA adducts by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Hotspots for A:T to T:A mutations include codons 131 and 179 and the 5'-AG acceptor splice site of intron 6. The unique TP53 mutational signature for AA identified in this study can be used to explore the hypothesis that botanical products containing this human carcinogen and nephrotoxin are responsible, in part, for the high prevalence of UUC and chronic renal disease in countries where Aristolochia herbal remedies traditionally have been used for medicinal purposes",

    "Abstract": "The bladder cancer genome harbors numerous oncogenic mutations and aberrantly methylated gene promoters. The aim of our study was to generate a profile of these alterations and investigate their use as biomarkers in urine sediments for noninvasive detection of bladder cancer. We systematically screened FGFR3, PIK3CA, TP53, HRAS, NRAS and KRAS for mutations and quantitatively assessed the methylation status of APC, ARF, DBC1, INK4A, RARB, RASSF1A, SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4, SFRP5 and WIF1 in a prospective series of tumor biopsies (N = 105) and urine samples (N = 113) from 118 bladder tumor patients. We also analyzed urine samples from 33 patients with noncancerous urinary lesions. A total of 95 oncogenic mutations and 189 hypermethylation events were detected in the 105 tumor biopsies. The total panel of markers provided a sensitivity of 93%, whereas mutation and methylation markers alone provided sensitivities of 72% and 70%, respectively. In urine samples, the sensitivity was 70% for all markers, 50% for mutation markers and 52% for methylation markers. FGFR3 mutations occurred more frequently in tumors with no methylation events than in tumors with one or more methylation events (78% vs. 33%; p < 0.0001). FGFR3 mutation in combination with three methylation markers (APC, RASSF1A and SFRP2) provided a sensitivity of 90% in tumors and 62% in urine with 100% specificity. These results suggest an inverse correlation between FGFR3 mutations and hypermethylation events, which may be used to improve noninvasive, DNA-based detection of bladder cancer",

    "Title": "TP53 mutations, human papilloma virus DNA and inflammation markers in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma from the Rift Valley, a high-incidence area in Kenya",
    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Esophagus is one of the most common malignancies in both men and women in eastern and south-eastern Africa. In Kenya, clinical observations suggest that this cancer is frequent in the Rift Valley area. However, so far, there has been no report on the molecular characteristics of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in this area. RESULTS: We have analyzed TP53 mutations, the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA and expression of inflammation markers Cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) and Nitrotyrosine (NTyR) in 28 cases (13 males and 15 females) of archived ESCC tissues collected at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, Kenya. Eleven mutations were detected in TP53 exons 5 to 8 (39%). All ESCC samples were negative for HPV 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 70, 73 and 82. Immunohistochemical analysis of Cox-2 and NTyR showed a low proportion of positive cases (17.4% and 39.1%, respectively). No association between the above markers and suspected risk factors (alcohol or tobacco use, hot tea drinking, use of charcoal for cooking) was found. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that mechanisms of esophageal carcinogenesis in eastern Africa might be different from other parts of the world. Low prevalence of TP53 mutation compared with other intermediate or high incidence areas of the world highlights this hypothesis. Our data did not support a possible ole of HPV in this series of cases. Further studies are needed to assess and compare the molecular patterns of ESCC from Kenya with those of high-incidence areas such as China or Central Asia",

    "Title": "A high-risk signature for patients with multiple myeloma established from the molecular classification of human myeloma cell lines",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is a plasma-cell tumor with heterogeneity in molecular abnormalities and treatment response. DESIGN AND METHODS: We have assessed whether human myeloma cell lines have kept patients' heterogeneity using Affymetrix gene expression profiling of 40 human myeloma cell lines obtained with or without IL6 addition and could provide a signature for stratification of patient risk. RESULTS: Human myeloma cell lines, especially those derived in the presence of IL6, displayed a heterogeneity that overlaps that of the patients with multiple myeloma. Human myeloma cell lines segregated into 6 groups marked by overexpression of MAF, MMSET, CCND1, FRZB with or without overexpression of cancer testis antigens (CTA). Cell lines of CTA/MAF and MAF groups have a translocation involving C-MAF or MAFB, cell lines of groups CCND1-1 and CCND1-2like have a t(11;14) and cell lines of group MMSET have a t(4;14). The CTA/FRZB group comprises cell lines that had no or no recurrent 14q32 translocation. Expression of 248 genes accounted for human myeloma cell line molecular heterogeneity. Human myeloma cell line heterogeneity genes comprise genes with prognostic value for survival of patients making it possible to build a powerful prognostic score involving a total of 13 genes. CONCLUSIONS: Human myeloma cell lines derived in the presence of IL6 recapitulate the molecular diversity of multiple myeloma that made it possible to design, using human myeloma cell line heterogeneity genes, a high-risk signature for patients at diagnosis. We propose this classification to be used when addressing the physiopathology of multiple myeloma with human myeloma cell lines",

    "Title": "The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity",
    "Abstract": "The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of 'personalized' therapeutic regimens",

    "Title": "Prognostic and predictive value of TP53 mutations in node-positive breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline- or anthracycline/taxane-based adjuvant therapy: results from the BIG 02-98 phase III trial",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pre-clinical data suggest p53-dependent anthracycline-induced apoptosis and p53-independent taxane activity. However, dedicated clinical research has not defined a predictive role for TP53 gene mutations. The aim of the current study was to retrospectively explore the prognosis and predictive values of TP53 somatic mutations in the BIG 02-98 randomized phase III trial in which women with node-positive breast cancer were treated with adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy with or without docetaxel. METHODS: The prognostic and predictive values of TP53 were analyzed in tumor samples by gene sequencing within exons 5 to 8. Patients were classified according to p53 protein status predicted from TP53 gene sequence, as wild-type (no TP53 variation or TP53 variations which are predicted not to modify p53 protein sequence) or mutant (p53 nonsynonymous mutations). Mutations were subcategorized according to missense or truncating mutations. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Cox-regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of outcome. RESULTS: TP53 gene status was determined for 18% (520 of 2887) of the women enrolled in BIG 02-98. TP53 gene variations were found in 17% (90 of 520). Nonsynonymous p53 mutations, found in 16.3% (85 of 520), were associated with older age, ductal morphology, higher grade and hormone-receptor negativity. Of the nonsynonymous mutations, 12.3% (64 of 520) were missense and 3.6% were truncating (19 of 520). Only truncating mutations showed significant independent prognostic value, with an increased recurrence risk compared to patients with non-modified p53 protein (hazard ratio = 3.21, 95% confidence interval = 1.740 to 5.935, P = 0.0002). p53 status had no significant predictive value for response to docetaxel. CONCLUSIONS: p53 truncating mutations were uncommon but associated with poor prognosis. No significant predictive role for p53 status was detected.

    "Title": "Clinical impact of TP53 alterations in adrenocortical carcinomas",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: To evaluate the role of somatic TP53 mutations and to correlate somatic and germline mutations with results of immunostaining, a large cohort of ACC patients was analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with ACC who underwent potential curative surgery at the authors' department were screened for TP53 somatic and germline mutations in exons 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 by DHPLC analysis. Aberrant samples were further analyzed by direct sequencing. Immunostaining was performed on corresponding paraffin sections in all patients. Complete clinical and follow-up data were correlated with the status of TP53. RESULTS: Thirty ACC patients were included. Four of 30 patients showed aberrant DHPLC configuration and direct sequencing confirmed 2 (7%) germline mutations (R337H, R248W), 1 (3%) somatic mutation (R213X), and 1 (3%) noncoding polymorphism (g.17708 A>T). The only patient with a positive family history harbored a TP53 mutation. Tumors of the three patients with mutations showed aberrant p53 expression in more than 10% of cells by immunostaining, compared to only 3 of 27 patients without mutations (p = 0.009). Aberrant p53 expression (>5%) was detected in 12/30 (40%) ACCs. The latter was associated with an increased Ki67 and van Slooten index (p </= 0.001; p = 0.020). Disease-free survival decreased significantly in patients with aberrant p53 IHC of more than 5% of cells (65.7 +/- 12.4 vs. 26.6 +/- 8.7 months; p = 0.043 log rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ACC revealed aberrant expression of p53 in 40%, and mutations were identified in 25% of these patients. Therefore aberrant p53 expression should be considered an indicator for genetic testing. A subgroup of apparently sporadic ACC is caused by TP53 germline mutations, and family history is a strong indicator for p53 germline mutations",

    "Title": "Aristolochic acid-associated urothelial cancer in Taiwan",
    "Abstract": "Aristolochic acid, a potent human carcinogen produced by Aristolochia plants, is associated with urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract (UUC). Following metabolic activation, aristolochic acid reacts with DNA to form aristolactam (AL)-DNA adducts. These lesions concentrate in the renal cortex, where they serve as a sensitive and specific biomarker of exposure, and are found also in the urothelium, where they give rise to a unique mutational signature in the TP53 tumor-suppressor gene. Using AL-DNA adducts and TP53 mutation spectra as biomarkers, we conducted a molecular epidemiologic study of UUC in Taiwan, where the incidence of UUC is the highest reported anywhere in the world and where Aristolochia herbal remedies have been used extensively for many years. Our study involves 151 UUC patients, with 25 patients with renal cell carcinomas serving as a control group. The TP53 mutational signature in patients with UUC, dominated by otherwise rare A:T to T:A transversions, is identical to that observed in UUC associated with Balkan endemic nephropathy, an environmental disease. Prominent TP53 mutational hotspots include the adenine bases of (5')AG (acceptor) splice sites located almost exclusively on the nontranscribed strand. A:T to T:A mutations also were detected at activating positions in the FGFR3 and HRAS oncogenes. AL-DNA adducts were present in the renal cortex of 83% of patients with A:T to T:A mutations in TP53, FGFR3, or HRAS. We conclude that exposure to aristolochic acid contributes significantly to the incidence of UUC in Taiwan, a finding with significant implications for global public health",

    "Title": "The somatic genomic landscape of glioblastoma",
    "Abstract": "We describe the landscape of somatic genomic alterations based on multidimensional and comprehensive characterization of more than 500 glioblastoma tumors (GBMs). We identify several novel mutated genes as well as complex rearrangements of signature receptors, including EGFR and PDGFRA. TERT promoter mutations are shown to correlate with elevated mRNA expression, supporting a role in telomerase reactivation. Correlative analyses confirm that the survival advantage of the proneural subtype is conferred by the G-CIMP phenotype, and MGMT DNA methylation may be a predictive biomarker for treatment response only in classical subtype GBM. Integrative analysis of genomic and proteomic profiles challenges the notion of therapeutic inhibition of a pathway as an alternative to inhibition of the target itself. These data will facilitate the discovery of therapeutic and diagnostic target candidates, the validation of research and clinical observations and the generation of unanticipated hypotheses that can advance our molecular understanding of this lethal cancer",

    "Title": "Characterization of a Novel Tumorigenic Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Cell Line: OANC1",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has a very high case fatality rate and is one of the fastest rising cancers worldwide. At the same time, research into EAC has been hampered by a relative lack of pre-clinical models, including representative cell lines. AIM: The purpose of this study was to establish and characterize a new EAC cell line. METHODS: Tumor cells were isolated from EAC tissue by enzymatic digestion. Origin of the cell line was confirmed by microsatellite-based genotyping. A panel of cancer-related genes was screened for mutations by targeted deep sequencing, Sanger sequencing and high resolution melting. CDKN2A promoter methylation was assessed by methylation specific high resolution melting. HER2 amplification was assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess expression of markers in xenografts grown in SCID mice. RESULTS: A novel EAC cell line, OANC1, was derived from a Barrett's-associated EAC. Microsatellite-based genotyping of OANC1 and patient DNA confirmed the origin of the cell line. Sequencing of OANC1 DNA identified homozygous TP53 missense (c.856G>A, p.E286K) and SMAD4 nonsense (c.1333C>T, p.R445X) mutations. OANC1 are tumorigenic when injected sub-cutaneously into SCID mice and xenografts were positive for columnar, glandular and intestinal epithelial markers commonly expressed in EAC. Xenografts exhibited strong p53 expression, consistent with a TP53 mutation. Some proteins, including p16, EGFR and beta-catenin, had heterogeneous expression patterns across xenograft cross-sections, indicative of tumor heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: OANC1 represents a valuable addition to the limited range of pre-clinical models for EAC. This new cell line will be a useful model system for researchers studying both basic and translational aspects of this disease",
