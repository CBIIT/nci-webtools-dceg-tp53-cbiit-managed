  "Title": "Germ line p53 mutations in a familial syndrome of breast cancer, sarcomas, and other neoplasms",
  "Abstract": "Familial cancer syndromes have helped to define the role of tumor suppressor genes in the development of cancer. The dominantly inherited Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is of particular interest because of the diversity of childhood and adult tumors that occur in affected individuals. The rarity and high mortality of LFS precluded formal linkage analysis. The alternative approach was to select the most plausible candidate gene. The tumor suppressor gene, p53, was studied because of previous indications that this gene is inactivated in the sporadic (nonfamilial) forms of most cancers that are associated with LFS. Germ line p53 mutations have been detected in all five LFS families analyzed. These mutations do not produce amounts of mutant p53 protein expected to exert a trans-dominant loss of function effect on wild-type p53 protein. The frequency of germ line p53 mutations can now be examined in additional families with LFS, and in other cancer patients and families with clinical features that might be attributed to the mutation",

  "Title": "Germ-line transmission of a mutated p53 gene in a cancer-prone family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Tumour suppressor genes, whose usual function seems to be controlling normal cell proliferation, have been implicated in many inherited and sporadic forms of malignancies Much evidence supports the concept of tumour formation by loss-of-function mutations in suppressor genes, as predicted by the two-hit model of Knudson and DeMars. The suppressor gene, p53, is affected in such a manner by numerous mutations, which occur in a variety of human tumours. These mutations usually represent the loss of one allele and the substitution of a single base in the other. We have now analysed the p53 gene in a family affected by Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by the occurrence of diverse mesenchymal and epithelial neoplasms at multiple sites. In some instances the neoplasms seem to be related to exposure to carcinogens, including ionizing radiation. The Li-Fraumeni family that we studied had noncancerous skin fibroblasts (NSF) with an unusual radiation-resistant phenotype. DNA derived from the NSF cells of four family members, spanning two generations, had the same point mutation in codon 245 (GGC----GAC) of the p53 gene. This mutation leads to substitution of aspartic acid for glycine in one of the regions identified as a frequent target of point mutations in p53. The NSF cell lines with the mutation also retained the normal p53 allele. This inherited p53 mutation may predispose the members of this family to increased susceptibility to cancer",

  "Title": "p53 germline mutations in Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Germline mutations within a defined region of the p53 gene have recently been found in families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). In the present study this region of p53 was sequenced in affected individuals from 8 families with LFS. In only 2 of them were such mutations detected. Our findings suggest that the p53 mutation could be the primary lesion in some but not all families with LFS, and confirm that there is a \u0027hot spot\u0027 for these mutations at the CpG dinucleotide moiety of codon 248. Assigning risks and counselling families on the basis of presence of p53 mutations should be approached with caution",

  "Title": "TP53 gene mutations and 17p deletions in human astrocytomas",
  "Abstract": "Astrocytomas, including the most malignant form, glioblastoma multiforme, are the most frequent and deadly primary tumors of the human nervous system. Recent molecular genetic analyses of astrocytomas have demonstrated frequent chromosome 17 deletions involving the telomeric region of the short arm (17p12-pter). This region contains a candidate tumor suppressor gene, TP53, which has recently been implicated in the etiology of a broad array of human cancers. To study the possible role of TP53 in astrocytoma development, 24 randomly chosen human astrocytic tumors were examined for genomic TP53 sequence aberrations using primer-directed DNA amplification in conjunction with direct sequencing. Five of the 11 grade III astrocytomas (glioblastoma multiforme), but only one of seven grade II astrocytomas (anaplastic astrocytoma) and none of either the grade I astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas demonstrated distinct point mutations involving the TP53 gene. These data suggest that TP53 mutations may play a role in astrocytoma development and are predominantly associated with higher grade tumors",

  "Title": "A germ line mutation in exon 5 of the p53 gene in an extended cancer family",
  "Abstract": "Germ line p53 point mutations have been reported for some families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a syndrome characterized by a dominantly inherited increased susceptibility for the development of early age of onset neoplasms of diverse origin in multiple family members. All of the initially reported p53 germ line mutations have been found exclusively within a single conserved, nonpolymorphic region of the gene between condons 245 and 258. The restricted distribution of these inherited mutations has led to speculation that germ line p53 mutations have unique properties [B. Vogelstein, Nature (Lond.), 348: 681-682, 1990]. We report here on the identification of a p53 germ line mutation at codon 133 (ATG----ACG) in nine members of an extended Li-Fraumeni syndrome family. This mutation leads to an amino acid substitution in the protein and is shown to completely cosegregate with Li-Fraumeni syndrome associated cancer in this family. Its location extends the region of the p53 gene where inherited mutations predisposing to cancer are observed and suggests that their distribution may be diverse",

  "Title": "Identification of a germ-line mutation in the p53 gene in a patient with an intracranial ependymoma",
  "Abstract": "We detected a germ-line mutation of the p53 gene in a patient with a malignant ependymoma of the posterior fossa. This mutation, which was found at codon 242, resulted in an amino acid substitution in a highly conserved site of exon 7 of the p53 gene; the same mutation was found in both the germ-line and the tumor tissue. This is the most common region of previously described somatic p53 mutations in tumor specimens and of the germ-line p53 mutations in patients with the Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome. Evaluation of the patient\u0027s family revealed several direct maternal and paternal relatives who had died at a young age from different types of cancer. The association of a germ-line p53 mutation with an intracranial malignancy and a strong family history of cancer suggests that p53 gene mutations predispose a person to malignancy and, like retinoblastoma mutations, may be inherited",

  "Title": "Germ-line splicing mutation of the p53 gene in a cancer-prone family",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant susceptibility to a variety of cancers including carcinomas of the breast and the adrenal cortex, tumors of brain and muscle tissue, and leukemias. Affected individuals develop cancer at a young age and often at multiple primary sites. A study has been conducted into the genetic basis of cancer in a particular Li-Fraumeni syndrome family. Examination of p53 as a candidate susceptibility gene revealed that, in two affected individuals, there was an aberrant larger transcript of 3.6 kilobases present in both tumor and constitutional material in addition to the normal-sized 2.8-kilobase transcript. The additional transcript was not found in three unaffected family members. S1 nuclease mapping localized the insertion toward the 5\u0027 end of the p53 transcript near exons 4 and 5, and sequencing revealed a point mutation in the splice donor site of intron 4 in the germ-line of the two affected individuals, which accounted for the presence of the larger transcript. The same splicing mutation was also detected in two obligate carriers and was not found in two unaffected individuals. As no mutations were detected in exons 5- 8 in either tumor examined, the second p53 allele was most likely lost during tumorigenesis in both tumors. The demonstration of a germ-line splicing mutation in affected individuals from a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family provides for a novel mechanism of p53 inactivation not seen previously in other affected families, in whom the mutations have all been missense.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

  "Title": "p53 mosaicism with an exon 8 germline mutation in the founder of a cancer-prone pedigree",
  "Abstract": "Changes in the tumor-suppressor gene p53 are frequently acquired during the course of malignant development of human tumors. Recently, constitutional heterozygous mutations in p53 exon 7 have been identified as the primary cause of cancer predisposition in cases of the familial Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome. These findings underline the need for extensive mutation screening in families with high cancer incidence. This report describes the detection and follow-up by two-dimensional single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (2DSSCP) of a new germline mutation of p53 exon 8 in a case of suspected Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Although a high cancer incidence had been reported in the family history of the father of siblings suffering from brain tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma, a constitutional heterozygous p53 mutation was identified only in the affected children. Retrospective analysis of archival tissue of a half-sister who died several years ago from a tumor of previously uncertain diagnosis revealed the same mutation. The mutation had therefore occurred in the germ cells of the mother, who thus appears to be a mosaic. The cancer predisposition of the paternal ancestors must have been due to other factors",

  "Abstract": "We have identified and analyzed 41 mutations in p53 in sporadic breast tumors from 136 unselected breast cancer patients and estimate that approximately 40% of such tumors contain p53 mutations. The frequency of G-T transversions and the incidence of guanosine mutations in the nontranscribed strand of the p53 gene were found to be higher than expected, and we suggest, therefore, that exogenous carcinogens have an etiological role in sporadic breast cancers. Mutations were recorded in 44 codons of the p53 gene, with no obvious mutational hot-spots, although mutations at codons 175, 194, 273, and 280 accounted for 25% of the changes. One germ-line mutation was found in 136 patients and so we conclude that constitutional mutation of p53 may be an uncommon etiological factor in breast cancer",

  "Title": "Inherited p53 gene mutations in breast cancer",
  "Abstract": "Recent evidence has implicated germ-line mutations of the p53 gene as the cause of cancer susceptibility in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, associated with the development of breast cancer and other neoplasms. Furthermore, somatic mutations of the p53 gene have been detected in a high percentage of non-familial breast cancers. We therefore sought to identify potential carriers of p53 gene mutations in a cohort of patients with early onset breast cancer. We examined 126 consecutive patients who developed breast cancer at or before the age of 40 for mutations of p53 within conserved regions of the gene. One patient with an inherited germ-line mutation of the p53 gene was identified but the functional significance of this mutation was not clear. It thus appears that only a small percentage of patients with breast cancer under the age of 40 carry germ-line mutations of the p53 gene, an observation which has implications for potential screening and risk assessment in such patients",

  "Title": "Germline mutations of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene in children and young adults with second malignant neoplasms",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. Acquired mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene have been detected in several human cancers, including colon, breast, and lung cancer. Inherited mutations (transmitted through the germline) of this gene can underlie the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare familial association of breast cancer in young women, childhood sarcomas, and other malignant neoplasms. We investigated the possibility that p53 mutations in the germline are associated with second primary cancers that arise in children and young adults who would not be considered as belonging to Li-Fraumeni families. METHODS. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood leukocytes of 59 children and young adults with a second primary cancer. The polymerase chain reaction, in combination with denaturant-gel electrophoresis and sequencing, was used to identify p53 gene mutations. RESULTS. Mutations of p53 that changed the predicted amino acid sequence were identified in leukocyte DNA from 4 of the 59 patients (6.8 percent). In three cases, the mutations were identical to ones previously found in the p53 gene. The fourth mutation was the first germline mutation to be identified in exon 9, at codon 325. Analysis of leukocyte DNA from close relatives of three of the patients indicated that the mutations were inherited, but cancer had developed in only one parent at the start of the study. CONCLUSIONS. These findings identify an important subgroup of young patients with cancer who carry germline mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene but whose family histories are not indicative of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The early detection of such mutations would be useful not only in treating these patients, but also in identifying family members who may be at high risk for the development of tumors",

  "Title": "Prevalence and spectrum of germline mutations of the p53 gene among patients with sarcoma",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND. Recent studies have identified germline mutations of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene in families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare inherited disorder characterized by a high risk of sarcomas of bone and soft tissue, breast cancer, and other tumors. In this report, we address the possibility that some sporadic sarcomas may be associated with new germline mutations of the p53 gene, which would not be manifested as familial cancer unless the patient survived to reproduce. METHODS. We studied DNA from peripheral leukocytes of 196 patients with sarcoma and from 200 controls. Of the 196 patients with sarcoma, 15 were selected because they had had multiple primary cancers or had a family history of cancer. The entire coding sequence and splice junctions of the p53 gene were analyzed for mutations. RESULTS. Eight germline mutations were found, three in patients with no known family history of cancer and five in patients with an unusual personal or family history of cancer. Four mutations caused amino acid substitutions, and four caused stop codons. These mutations were not present in any of the 200 controls. CONCLUSIONS. New germline mutations of the p53 gene are rare among patients with \u0027sporadic\u0027 sarcoma but may be common in patients with sarcoma whose background includes either multiple primary cancers or a family history of cancer. Diverse mutations of this gene were associated with an increased likelihood of cancer; hence, the entire gene should be considered a target for heritable mutation. It appears that the group of patients with cancer who carry germline mutations of the p53 gene is more diverse than is suggested by the clinical definition of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The identification of carriers could be of substantial clinical importance",

  "Abstract": "We studied the pedigrees of 17 index patients with osteosarcoma, recording malignant disease and cause of death for first- and second- degree relatives. There were seven cancers and five cancer deaths per 2151.5 person-years in first-degree relatives of osteosarcoma patients under the age of 50 years, a significantly greater incidence than in an age- and sex-matched population group (p \u003c 0.001). This excess of malignancy was largely due to two families which fulfilled the criteria for the Li-Fraumeni cancer family syndrome. Both of these families were shown to have the genetic alterations in the p53 gene which have been implicated in this syndrome. Our study suggests that orthopaedic surgeons seeing new cases of osteosarcoma should arrange screening for familial malignancy",

  "Title": "Detection of novel germ-line p53 mutations in diverse-cancer-prone families identified by selecting patients with childhood adrenocortical carcinoma",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Germ-line p53 mutations appear to be inherited among the members of families diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). The mutations detected in those families to date have been clustered in exon 7 of the p53 gene and, typically, have been single-base substitutions resulting in amino acid changes. PURPOSE: Our aim was to define the spectrum of p53 mutations associated with LFS. METHODS: From seven cancer-prone families identified by selecting members with childhood adrenocortical carcinoma as probands, we chose two families, each of which had two members from whom specimens could be obtained for genetic analysis. To detect germ-line p53 gene mutations in these individuals, we performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis with Taq polymerase and oligonucleotide primers specific for p53 gene sequences. Genomic DNA extracted from fresh tissue samples and paraffin-embedded tumor samples was amplified, denatured, and electrophoresed on neutral polyacrylamide gels. PCR amplification was also carried out using total RNA from adrenocortical carcinoma samples of the proband in family 1. PCR products were purified, subcloned, and sequenced. RESULTS: We detected novel germ-line p53 mutations in affected members of both cancer-prone families. In the proband of family 1, a single-base deletion was detected at the first nucleotide of codon 307 in exon 8 of the p53 gene, resulting in a premature stop codon in exon 10. In family 2, we detected an A to C transversion at the second nucleotide of codon 286 in exon 8, both in DNA isolated from the adrenocortical tumor of the proband and in DNA isolated from the astrocytoma of the proband\u0027s father. This single-base substitution resulted in an amino acid substitution of alanine for glutamic acid. Both of these mutations are located outside the highly conserved region of the p53 gene where mutations in patients with LFS have been reported previously. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that a wide range of germ-line p53 mutations is inherited in members of diverse-cancer-prone families",

While all four mutations were identified by single strand conformation polymorphism, the comparative sensitivity of RNase protection was 50% (2 of 4). Heterozygosity was retained at mutated codons in 3 of 4 cases. One pedigree was consistent with the Li- Fraumeni syndrome, and bone marrow from both diagnosis and remission indicated a germline G to T transversion at codon 272 (valine to leucine). Although members of another family were affected with leukemia, a 2-bp deletion in exon 6 was nonhereditary. The other two nonhereditary p53 mutations included a T to G transversion at codon 270 (phenylalanine to cysteine) and a G to C transversion at codon 248 (arginine to proline).

Genomic DNA from the second tumor showed the same mutation and loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus. The mutant mRNA and protein were present in the tumor tissue. In contrast, in the normal tissues bearing the germline mutation in the heterozygous state, predominantly normal mRNA was expressed and the mutant p53 protein was not detectable. The functional silence and relative lack of mutant p53 mRNA expression in the normal tissues of this patient may be caused by decreased stability or decreased production.

  "Abstract": "We report a constitutional mutation of codon 273 in exon 8 of the p53 gene. The affected individual has developed multiple independent benign and malignant tumours (tricholemmoma of the scalp, multiple trichoepitheliomata of the face, osteosarcoma of the ovary, bilateral breast cancer, malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the thigh and endometrial adenocarcinoma) and belongs to a family with some, but not all, features of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The mutation, found in both blood lymphocyte and tumour specimens, is a cytosine to thymine transition at codon 273, resulting in an amino acid change from arginine to cysteine. The mother and sister of the index case both died of tumours at an early age. We have demonstrated that formalin- preserved material from these tumours contains the same C--\u003eT mutation at codon 273, indicating that this mutation has probably been transmitted through the germline. All tumours from the index case, both benign and malignant, showed immunohistochemical positivity with four antibodies to the p53 protein. Positive staining was also seen in scattered nuclei of morphologically normal epidermal keratinocytes and pilosebaceous cells, but not in lymphocytes or other morphologically normal cells from the index case. However, a similar staining pattern in apparently normal tissue was also observed in 13/48 sections from other individuals with various skin conditions (melanocytic naevi, psoriasis and normal skin adjacent to malignant melanoma and fibrous histiocytomas), suggesting that this pattern of p53 staining may not be unique to individuals with constitutional p53 mutations",

Two of 20 patients whose normal tissue could be studied carried germ-line mutations of p53. Immunohistochemical analysis of the p53 protein was carried out using monoclonal antibody PAb1801. Ninety-six percent of the missense mutations were associated with abnormal accumulation of p53 protein, but nonsense mutations, a splicing mutation, and most deletions did not result in p53 protein accumulation. A statistically significant association between p53 protein accumulation in poorly differentiated stage III serous carcinomas and small primary tumor size at diagnosis was found, perhaps suggesting that p53 protein accumulation accelerates the metastatic spread from a primary tumor. Overall, our findings indicate that alterations of p53 play a major role in ovarian cancer, including predisposition to the disease in some patients, and suggest a possible mechanism for somatic mutations leading to this cancer",

  "Title": "Hereditary p53 mutation in a patient with multiple tumors: significance for genetic counseling",
  "Abstract": "We describe molecular genetic findings in a patient who initially presented with an intermediate teratoma of the testis and who many years later presented with an oligodendro-astrocytoma. In addition he developed a malignant histiocytoma over the scapula, an adenocarcinoma of the stomach and a late stage adenoma of the sigmoid colon. Due to the development of several neoplasms the possibility of either ataxia telangiectasia or Li-Fraumeni syndrome was considered in differential diagnosis. A molecular genetic investigation revealed that both he and his brother carried a germline p53 tumor suppressor gene mutation at codon 248. From this result we conclude that this family belongs to the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Once characterized as belonging to the Li- Fraumeni syndrome, the remaining members of the family were typed to determine if they too carried the same mutation. The two children of the index patient were shown not to carry the mutation and are therefore at no increased risk of developing any of the Li-Fraumeni spectrum of malignancies. A molecular genetic investigation into similar families could help to prevent the development of additional malignancies as seen in the index patient, as radiotherapy may interfere with the normal function of the p53 protein and this may in turn help to orchestrate DNA repair after radiation",

  "Title": "Prevalence and diversity of constitutional mutations in the p53 gene among 21 Li-Fraumeni families",
  "Abstract": "The entire coding sequence of the p53 gene was analysed for the presence of mutations in 12 families conforming to a restricted definition of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (classic LFS) and nine families with features of LFS conforming to a broader definition. Mutations were detected in seven families. Six were point mutations with one each affecting codons 175, 180, and 220 and three affecting codon 248. The seventh was a deletion/insertion mutation in exon 4. Germline mutations in p53 were a feature of families which included children with rhabdomyosarcoma and/or adrenal cortical carcinoma. Germline p53 mutations were detected in six of the nine families with such tumors. An analysis of these 7 mutations, together with 34 published examples, showed that more than one-half were transitions at CpG dinucleotides, suggesting that the majority of germline p53 mutations may arise as a result of spontaneous events. The most common cancers occurring in the 41 families with germline p53 mutations, in common with classic LFS, were bone and soft tissue sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, and adrenocortical carcinoma, although less than one-half of the probands with germline p53 mutations came from classic LFS families. More than one-half of the cancers overall and nearly one- third of the breast cancers were diagnosed before 30 years of age. These observations have important implications for asymptomatic carriers of germline p53 mutations, and there is a need for international collaboration in the development of protocols for the management of such families",

Inactivation of the tumour suppressor gene, WT1, is associated with tumour aetiology in approximately 10-15% of WTs. Chromosome 17p changes have been noted in cytogenetic studies of WTs, prompting us to screen 140 WTs for p53 mutations. When histopathology reports were available, p53 mutations were present in eight of eleven anaplastic WTs, a tumour subtype associated with poor prognosis. Amplification of MDM2, a gene whose product binds and sequesters p53, was excluded. Our results indicate that p53 alterations provide a molecular marker for anaplastic WTs",

  "Abstract": "Codon 257 of the p53 gene is an extremely rare target for somatic mutations (accounting for only two of 1600 published mutations). We report here two constitutional mutations both affecting the second nucleotide of codon 257. A thymine to adenine transversion resulting in an amino acid change from leucine to glutamine was found in one proband who developed multiple independent malignant tumors (osteosarcoma, phyllodes tumor, soft-tissue sarcoma). Her mother died of early-onset breast cancer. In the other case, a deletion resulting in a frameshift in the C-terminal coding region of p53 was found in a woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 34. This woman belongs to a family with features of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. In both cases, the p53 mutations identified in the proband was found in other members of the family. Codon 257, even if rarely mutated in somatic cells, may thus be an important target for germ-line mutations",

  "Title": "A germline 2.35 kb deletion of p53 genomic DNA creating a specific loss of the oligomerization domain inherited in a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family",
  "Abstract": "The primary genetic cancer predisposing event in many Li-Fraumeni syndrome families is a germline mutation in the p53 gene. We describe an extended Li-Fraumeni family with a germline mutation in the p53 gene involving a deletion of exon 10. The mutation is a 2.35 kilobase intragenic deletion encompassing exon 10, which results in the specific loss of the entire p53 oligomerization domain. This mutation segregates with the cancer phenotype. A lymphoblastoid cell line developed from a mutation carrier shows accumulation of mutant p53 protein by immunoblotting. However, tumor tissues from two affected carriers are negative by immunohistochemical staining. A major structural alteration specifically involving the oligomerization domain of a germline p53 gene has not been previously described and occurs in a region rarely mutated in sporadic tumors. The oligomerization domain is dispensable for many wild-type p53 functions, including transactivation, sequence- specific DNA binding, and suppression of oncogenic transformation. However, the domain appears to be required for transcriptional repression, and DNA strand reassociation. The identification of this mutation in an LFS family may yield insights into the importance of the oligomerization domain for suppressor function of the p53 tumor suppressor gene",

  "Title": "Germ-line exclusion of a single p53 allele by premature termination of translation in a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family",
  "Abstract": "Germline p53 mutations have been detected in approximately half of the families affected by the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), in which they are believed to represent the genetic status predisposing to multiple cancers. Failure to detect mutations in the other half of LFS families suggests that sequence analysis, which has been limited to the p53 gene coding region, have overlooked other genetic events lying outside of this region or/and that alterations in other gene(s) than p53 may also lead to the syndrome. In this report, we present the evidence that a single base pair deletion in the p53 coding sequence, leading to premature signal termination of translation, generates a null allele by preventing transport of mutant allele mRNAs into the cytoplasm. This allelic exclusion which confers a status of unizygote vis-a-vis the wild-type p53 gene to individuals who carry the mutant allele, leads to predisposition to multiple cancers in a Li-Fraumeni family. Thus, the loss of the wild-type p53 allele appears as the rate limiting step in tumor induction",

  "Abstract": "Germline mutations of p53 have been implicated as a cause of cancer susceptibility in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Since inactivation of p53 has been suggested to play an important causative role in lung cancer, the present study of the prevalence of germline mutations in 148 patients with this neoplasm was performed. None of 138 randomly chosen patients were found to carry such mutations, while a single patient had a nonsense mutation at codon 213 among 10 patients selected for early onset and/or occurrence of multiple primary cancers. In contrast to the previous report of biallelic expression of p53 in a case with a germline missense mutation, preferential expression of the wild-type allele was observed in the heterozygous state in both normal lung and peripheral blood lymphocytes of our case, whereas expression of mutant mRNA was readily detectable in her lung cancer in the absence of the remaining wild-type allele. Interestingly, the family history of the proband showed a mild aggregation of adulthood cancers and a high prevalence of stomach cancer, a rare component in American families affected by the syndrome. These observations suggest the presence of heterogeneity with regard to molecular and clinical features of germline p53 mutations",

  "Title": "Splice-site mutation of the p53 gene in a family with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer",
  "Abstract": "Germline mutations within evolutionary conserved exons of the p53 gene predispose to tumor development in several familial cancer syndromes. We now report identification of a novel p53 mutation affecting the splice acceptor site of exon 6 in the germline DNA of a family with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer. This splice-site mutation, which results in omission of exon 6 and creates a frame-shift and premature stop codon in transcripts from the mutant allele, was found in seven family members--four of whom have developed breast, ovarian or choroid plexus tumors before age 35. Our finding suggests the need to examine the entire p53 gene for splice-site, frame-shift, and nonsense (as well as missense) mutations in families with early-onset hereditary breast and breast-ovarian cancers not linked to the BRCA1 gene on chromosome 17q. We propose that the term \u0027p53 familial cancer syndrome\u0027 be applied to clusters of tumors in families with documented germline p53 mutations, regardless of the histopathologic findings or pattern of tumor development",

  "Title": "Germline mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in children with osteosarcoma",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: We investigated the possibility that a significant proportion of children with osteosarcoma harbor germline mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and, therefore, this subgroup of pediatric cancer patients should be considered for large-scale predictive testing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral-blood leukocytes from 235 unselected children with osteosarcoma from 33 institutions were screened for the presence of germline p53 mutations using constant denaturant gel electrophoresis (CDGE). Exons 5 through 8 were evaluated in all patients and exon 2 and exon 9 were analyzed in 59 and 95 patients, respectively. Those samples that showed aberrant migration on CDGE were sequenced or analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products to confirm the nature of the gene alteration. RESULTS: In 18 samples, CDGE showed fragments of the p53 gene with altered electrophoretic mobilities compared with wild-type p53. DNA sequencing showed that 11 samples had an identical, previously described polymorphism. The other seven contained heterozygous p53 mutations located in exon 5 (n \u003d 3), exon 6 (n \u003d 1), exon 7 (n \u003d 1), and exon 8 (n \u003d 2). Six alterations were missense mutations and one was a nonsense mutation. Three of these patients had first-degree relatives with cancer. One of these three kindreds had a family history consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). CONCLUSION: We identified germline p53 mutations in seven of 235 (3.0%) children with osteosarcoma. Four of these mutations were found in patients who did not have first-degree relatives with cancer. Although genetic transmission of the altered p53 gene could not be tested in this survey because of how it was designed, it is possible that predictive testing for p53 mutations could identify unaffected relatives of gene carriers who also have a high risk for the development of cancer. This study provides evidence for the importance of considering children with osteosarcoma for predictive testing for germline p53 mutations",

  "Title": "Novel germline mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in a child with incidentally discovered adrenal cortical carcinoma",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: We report a case of adrenal cortical carcinoma in an infant, which was incidentally discovered by renal sonography after a urinary tract infection. The previous death of a sibling after rhabdomyosarcoma in infancy prompted a search for a heritable p53 tumor suppressor gene mutation in this family. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Starting with frozen adrenal carcinoma tissue, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by direct sequencing of exons 4-8 of p53 was used to search for a mutation. When a mutation was identified in exon 6 of the tumor p53 sequence, PCR amplification and direct sequencing of exon 6 alone was then performed on DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of all immediate family members to determine whether a germline mutation was present. A different set of primers was used by a second laboratory at our institution to independently confirm the presence of the mutation in the adrenal carcinoma and in paraffin-embedded rhabdomyosarcoma tissue of the deceased sibling. RESULTS: A C-to-T transition was identified at a CpG site in codon 196 resulting in a change from arginine to a stop codon (CGA to TGA). The identical mutation, present as the sole p53 allele in the tumor DNA samples and in the heterozygous state with wild type p53 allele in DNA from PBLs (germline), was found in the adrenal carcinoma, the rhabdomyosarcoma, and the PBLs of the tumor-bearing child and her healthy father and 5-year-old brother. This nonsense mutation of p53 has never before been reported in the germline. The extended pedigree showed only one known additional cancer. CONCLUSIONS: A novel germline p53 mutation was identified by investigation of a sibling pair with cancers associated with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome in a family with an otherwise negative history for cancer. The implications of this case for identification of carriers of p53 germline mutations and their clinical management are discussed",

  "Title": "Germline p53 gene mutations in subsets of glioma patients",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heritable germline mutations of the p53 gene have been described in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, occasionally in nonfamilial malignancies such as multifocal osteosarcoma, in a small subgroup of young patients with two or more primary malignancies, and in patients with sporadic breast carcinoma. We recently reported that multifocal gliomas are frequently associated with other primary malignancies, and we hypothesized that genetic alterations may account for this phenomenon. PURPOSE: We examined the frequency of germline p53 gene mutations in patients with glioma and either multifocality of lesions, history of an additional primary (different) malignancy, or a family history of cancer. METHODS: Lymphocytes from 51 glioma patients were analyzed for germline p53 gene mutations using RNA-polymerase chain reaction analysis, single-strand conformation polymorphism, and gene sequencing techniques. RESULTS: Germline p53 gene mutations were detected in six of 19 patients with multifocal glioma, including two with family history of cancer, one with another primary malignancy, and two with all three risk factors; one of four patients with unifocal glioma, another primary malignancy, and a family history of cancer; and two of 15 patients with unifocal glioma and a family history of cancer but no second malignancies. No mutations were detected in the patient with unifocal glioma and another malignancy or in the 12 control patients with unifocal glioma and no second malignancies or family history of cancer. Patients having mutations were younger than other patients in the same group. CONCLUSIONS: Germline p53 mutations are frequent in patients with multifocal glioma, glioma and another primary malignancy, and glioma associated with a family history of cancer, particularly if these factors are combined. IMPLICATIONS: Relatives at high risk can be identified for genetic counseling, early cancer detection, and possible enrollment in chemoprevention trials",

  "Title": "High frequency of germline p53 mutations in childhood adrenocortical cancer",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ADCC) is a rare childhood cancer, affecting three of 1 million children younger than 16 years old in the United States. ADCC may be found in association with the Li-Fraumeni and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes. Children with ADCC are also at substantially increased risk of second primary cancers. Because of these associations, it is believed that the genetic basis for ADCC is stronger than for most childhood malignancies. Germline mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene are associated with cancer predisposition in families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome as well as in individuals with sporadically occurring component tumors of the syndrome. PURPOSE: We investigated the possibility that germline TP53 gene alterations existed in children with ADCC. METHODS: Sixteen children with ADCC under the age of 18 were identified from searches of medial oncology records at three Canadian hospitals. Eleven of these 16 patients identified were alive. The mean age at diagnosis was 4.8 years (range, 1-17 years). Family histories were obtained for 11 unselected children with ADCC (six girls and five boys). Pathologic confirmation of tumor diagnosis was obtained from the medical records. Using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis followed by single-strand DNA sequencing, genomic DNA extracted from whole blood was analyzed for the presence of TP53 mutations for six living ADCC patients. RESULTS: Three of six (50%) children were found to carry germline TP53 mutations in exons 5, 6, and 7, respectively. Both wild-type and mutant alleles were identified in all three TP53 sequences, indicating that the patients were heterozygous for germline TP53 mutations. None of these children was from a family with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The mutation in one child was shown to be inherited from the mother, who subsequently developed breast cancer. A striking excess of cancer was found in one family of a patient carrying wild-type TP53. CONCLUSIONS: Our observation of a high frequency of germline TP53 mutations in children with sporadic ADCC suggests that these children may represent probands with which to ascertain Li-Fraumeni syndrome families. It may be reasonable for children with adrenocortical carcinoma to be candidates for germline TP53 analysis. In light of the wealth of information in the Li-Fraumeni literature that associates germline TP53 mutations with a variety of malignancies, this testing may have important consequences for risk assessment for other close relatives, including early-onset breast cancer in the mothers",

  "Abstract": "A family with an aggregation of adrenocortical carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and early onset breast cancer was referred to our laboratory. Because this aggregation was reminiscent of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, germ-line mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene was sought in the DNA of two affected members. The highly conserved regions spanning exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were screened by a previously validated denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis method. A single base pair deletion at codon 215 was detected in constitutional DNA of the two patients, and in the DNA extracted from an adrenocortical carcinoma tumor specimen of the propositus. This deletion is predicted to lead to the formation of a truncated p53 protein, a relatively rare event in Li-Fraumeni families. The spectrum of tumors observed in this family does not differ markedly from the spectrum observed in families with missense p53 mutations",

  "Abstract": "We investigated the possibility that a proportion of children with sporadic rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) carry constitutional mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. 33 patients with sporadic RMS at two large outpatient pediatric oncology clinics submitted blood samples. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and PCR was used to amplify exons 2-11 of the p53 gene. Amplified genomic DNA was screened for the presence of germline p53 mutations using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. The DNA sequence of those samples that showed aberrant migration of bands on SSCP analysis was determined to identify the precise nature of the gene mutations. Patient records were reviewed to assess clinical correlates of the mutant p53 carrier state. Heterozygous constitutional mutations were detected in 3/33 patient samples screened. Two of these missense mutations are located in exon 7 and one in exon 8 of the p53 gene. The presence of mutations was not correlated with tumor histology, stage, or site. However, an association between young age at diagnosis and presence of a constitutional p53 mutation was noted: 3/13 children under the age of 3 yr at diagnosis carried mutations, whereas none of 20 children over 3 yr of age at diagnosis harbored a detectable constitutional mutation. These results in children with RMS corroborates previous findings in other clinical settings suggesting that the mutant p53 carrier state may predispose individuals to malignancy at an early age. Although this study did not assess whether the mutations were preexisting or new germline alterations, assessment of close relatives of RMS patients for cancer risk and predictive genetic testing may be indicated",

  "Abstract": "This report describes clinical, neuropathological and molecular genetic findings in a Swiss family with four brain tumours in only two generations. The neoplasms observed covered a wide range of biologic behaviour, from a slowly growing lesion already apparent at birth, to anaplastic astrocytoma in a young adult and glioblastomas at the age of less than 10 years. The only non-neural neoplasms in this family were a case of leukemia and an adrenocortical carcinoma. A germline deletion of codon 236 of the p53 tumour suppressor gene was identified as an underlying cause and detected in all affected family members. This mutation has not previously been reported as germline transmission or in sporadic tumours. The unusual accumulation of CNS tumours may be due to a certain organ-specific effect of this particular p53 mutation or it may reflect the specific genetic back-ground of this family",

  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome(LFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes individuals to multiple forms of cancer including breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, brain tumor, osteosarcoma, leukemia, and adrenocortical carcinoma. Recently, germ-line mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene has been implicated in this familial disorder. We report a case of a 25-year old woman who presented with bilateral breast cancer and uterine leiomyoma. Her mother had died of early-onset bilateral breast cancer. And her younger sister had breast carcinoma as well, which was identified at the age of 22, indicating her strong familial history. To test for the presence of the p53 germ-line mutation, we analyzed the genomic DNA from the peripheral blood of the proband and her sister by PCR-SSCP analysis of exon 5 through exon 8 of the p53 gene. As a result, a p53 mutation in exon 7 was detected in an allele, and it was shared with her sister as the same pattern. Sequencing analysis determined the altered nucleotide at codon 248(CGG \u003e TGG) which is one of the most frequent mutation sites related to LFS. Therefore, this patient has the most consistent characteristic features of LFS phenotype and it is believed that this case is the first report of a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome carrying the p53 germ-line mutation in Korea",

  "Abstract": "Individuals with germ line mutations in the p53 gene, such as Li- Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), have an increased occurrence of many types of cancer, including an unusually high incidence of breast cancer. This report documents that normal breast epithelial cells obtained from a patient with LFS (with a mutation at codon 133 of the p53 gene) spontaneously immortalized in cell culture while the breast stromal fibroblasts from this same patient did not. Spontaneous immortalization of human cells in vitro is an extremely rare event. This is the first documented case of the spontaneous immortalization of breast epithelial cells from a patient with LFS in culture. LFS patient breast stromal fibroblasts infected with a retroviral vector containing human papillomavirus type 16 E7 alone were able to immortalize, whereas stromal cells obtained from patients with wild-type p53, similarly infected with human papillomavirus type 16 E7, did not. The present results indicate a protective role of normal pRb-like functions in breast stromal fibroblasts but not in breast epithelial cells and reinforces an important role of wild-type p53 in the regulation of the normal growth and development of breast epithelial tissue",

  "Abstract": "We investigated the frequency of p53 mutations in 47 pediatric brain tumors of various histologic subtypes that were collected over a period of 5 years. The specimens included 15 primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), 17 low grade astrocytomas, one anaplastic astrocytoma, three glioblastomas (GBMs), one mixed glial tumor, eight ependymomas, one choroid plexus carcinoma, and one gangliocytoma/ganglioneuroma. Mutations were identified by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 4-8 and verified by sequencing. Mutations were present in 2 of 3 cases of GBM, but not in 17 low grade astrocytomas (P \u003d 0.02, Fisher\u0027s exact test). One GBM demonstrated a germline GGC to AGC transition (gly to ser) at codon 245 with loss of the wild-type allele. A second GBM contained a CGG to TGG transition (arg to trp) at codon 248, also with loss of the wild-type allele, but normal tissue was not available for comparison. In addition, one of 15 PNETs retained heterozygosity but demonstrated a somatic CGT to TGT transition (arg to cys) at codon 273. p53 mutations were absent in other histologic subtypes and in two cases with multiple primary cancers. These data are consistent with earlier findings that p53 mutations are rare in PNETs, which are primarily pediatric tumors. In contrast to adult gliomas, p53 mutations in pediatric gliomas appear restricted to the GBMs. The lack of p53 mutations in pediatric low grade astrocytomas suggests not only histological differences, but also a different molecular pathogenesis in adult and pediatric patients",

  "Title": "Heterogeneity in Li-Fraumeni families: p53 mutation analysis and immunohistochemical staining",
  "Abstract": "We have screened two families for constitutional TP53 mutations, one family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and the other with features of this syndrome. We report a germline mutation in exon 7 of the TP53 gene in the family with \u0027Li-Fraumeni-like\u0027 syndrome. The mutation occurred at codon 245 and causes a Gly-Ser amino acid change. It was inherited by both affected and unaffected subjects. Malignant tumours from all members of this family showed strong positive nuclear immunohistochemical staining with antibodies CM-1 and DO1, directed against TP53. In contrast, no constitutional TP53 mutations were found in a \u0027classic\u0027 Li-Fraumeni family. In this family positive staining was seen in both malignant and normal tissues. These results support previous findings that variants of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome exist since not all LFS families carry TP53 germline mutations. Secondly, immunohistochemical positivity is not synonymous with an underlying mutation and is therefore inadequate as an exclusive diagnostic marker",

  "Abstract": "We demonstrated a germline p53 replication error in two generations of a Li-Fraumeni family affected with liposarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and osteosarcoma. The trinucleotide repeat mutation changed 5\u0027-AGT GTG GTG GTG-3\u0027 at codons 215-218 to 5\u0027-AGT TGG TTG GTG GTG-3\u0027. The predicted protein would be elongated by one amino acid (val216-- \u003etrp leu) without a change in charge. Detection of p53 in the adrenal tumor by immunostaining suggested that the mutant protein was expressed.

  "Title": "Germ-Line p53 mutations in 15 families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Germ-line mutations of the tumor-suppressor gene p53 have been observed in some families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a familial cancer syndrome in which affected relatives develop a diverse set of early-onset malignancies including breast carcinoma, sarcomas, and brain tumors.  The analysis of the p53 gene in LFS families has been limited, in most studies to date, to the region between exon 5 and exon 9.  In order to determine the frequency and distribution of germ-line p53 mutations in LFS, we sequenced the 10 coding exons of the p53 gene in lymphocytes and fibroblast cell lines derived from 15 families with the syndrome.  Germ-line mutations were observed in eight families.  Six mutations were missense mutations located between exons 5 and 8.  One mutation was a nonsense mutation in exon 6, and one mutation was a splicing mutation in intron 4, generating aberrant shorter p53 RNA(s).  In three families, a mutation of the p53 gene was observed in the fibroblast cell line derived from the proband.  However, the mutation was not found in affected relatives in two families and in the blood from the one individual, indicating that the mutation probably occurred during cell culture in vitro.  In four families, no mutation was observed.  This study indicates that germ-line p53 mutations in LFS are mostly located between exons 5 and 8 and that approximately 50% of patients with LFS have no germ-line mutations in the coding region of the p53 gene (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED at 25 words)",

  "Title": "Incidence of germ-line p53 mutations in patients with gliomas",
  "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies on intracranial tumors have suggested that the observed familial aggregation of a proportion of gliomas may be due to inherited predisposition to their development. In the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) associated with germ-line mutations of the p53 gene, nervous-system tumors are observed with increased frequency. However, the contribution of germ-line p53 mutation to the incidence of brain tumors has not been investigated. In order to address this point, we have performed 2 independent investigations. First, we have examined an unselected series of brain tumors. Whenever the presence of a p53 mutation in the tumor was observed, the possible germ-line origin of the mutation was investigated. Germ-line p53 mutations were also analyzed in constitutional DNA of patients with gliomas that had been selected for an unusual personal or familial history of cancer. Germ- line p53 mutations were detected in 1 out of 80 unselected cases and in 3 out of 15 selected cases (20%). We conclude that germ-line p53 mutation may contribute to a small fraction of gliomas that develop in the general population. The presence of a personal or familial history of cancer in a patient with glioma should prompt the search for a germ- line p53 mutation. However, the low frequency of p53 germ-line mutation suggests that alterations of this gene may not account for most familial cases of gliomas",

  "Title": "Constitutional p53 mutations associated with brain tumors in young adults",
  "Abstract": "Identification of patients at risk for developing brain tumors is important for the development of preventative strategies. Because individuals with germline p53 mutations may be at increased risk, we examined DNA from brain tumor-derived cell lines and malignant and normal nervous system tissue for p53 gene mutations using the single strand conformation polymorphism assay and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA. We found mutations in the p53 gene in eight of 22 adult glioma tissue specimens and germline mutations in two of these eight patients. In contrast, mutation of the p53 gene was not detectable in either 16 glial tumors occurring in children, glial tumor tissue from three unrelated glioblastoma multiforme patients with a familial history of cancer, or in benign meningiomas. One constitutional p53 mutation was a G to T transversion at codon 154, and the second was a C to T transition at codon 256. Both patients with germline mutations developed glioblastoma multiforme before the age of 31, although the median age for glioma patients is above 50. These findings suggest that p53 germline mutations may identify a subset of young adults predisposed to the development of high-grade astrocytic tumors",

  "Title": "A simple p53 functional assay for screening cell lines, blood, and tumors",
  "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 gene are implicated in the pathogenesis of half of all human tumors.  We have developed a simple functional assay for p53 mutation in which human p53 expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae activates transcription of the ADE2 gene.  Consequently, yeast colonies containing wild-type p53 are white and colonies containing mutant p53 are red.  Since this assay tests the critical biological function of p53, it can distinguish inactivating mutations from functionally silent mutation.  By combining this approach with gap repair techniques in which unpurified p53 reverse transcription-PCR products are cloned by homologous recombination in vivo it is possible to screen large numbers of samples and multiple clones per sample for biologically important mutations.  This means that mutations can be detected in tumor specimens contaminated with large amounts of normal tissue.  In addition, the assay detects temperature-sensitive mutants, which give pink colonies.  We show here that this form of p53 functional assay can be used rapidly to detect germline mutations in blood samples, somatic mutations in tumors, and mutations in cell lines.",

  "Title": "Methodical detection of germinal mutations in the tumour suppressing gene p53",
  "Abstract": "Background: The tumour suppressor gene p53 is exhibits somatic mutations in a high proportion of human tumours.  In addition, there are cancer families suffering from the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, the members of which carry germ line mutations in this gene.  The carriers of the p53 germ line mutations have a high risk of developing tumours.  The genetic diagnosis of carriership of the mutation in the tumour family members is important for preventive measures and for eventual tumour therapy modification.  Methods and Results:  We have developed a method for the detection of germ line mutations in the p53 gene based on non-radioactive SSCP and direct sequencing of PCR products. We have proved the efficiency of the method by finding known mutations in eight tumour cell lines.  In our collection of tumour families we have detected polymoprhisms in exons 4 and 6 of the p53 gene.  In one family which conformed to the criteria of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, we have found an ovel germ line mutation in exon 5.  Conclusions:  The method developed by us is very simple and sensitive. The germ line mutations in the p53 gene are very rare.",

  "Title": "A new germline TP53 gene mutation in a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "This report describes an unusual clinical presentation of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Family history revealed a mild aggregation of adult cancers in one generation, and an unusual clustering of brain tumours of early childhood in the following generation. In order to evaluate the genetic basis for cancer predisposition in this family, molecular genetic analysis for the occurrence of germline TP53 tumour suppressor gene mutations was performed on 12 siblings of two generations. Indirect mutation analysis was performed by the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique. Alterations were characterised by automated direct fluorescence sequencing analysis. Tumour material was also examined for p53 protein accumulation by immunohistochemistry. Initially, a TP53 gene germline missense mutation was detected in an 11- year-old kindred with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) following intensive treatment of a brain tumour. In peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of this proband, a reduction to hemizygosity occurred. During AML treatment, detection of LOH of 17p was used as a marker for clonality and treatment control. The mutation was found to be inherited from the proband\u0027s mother, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 48 years. Further, three siblings were carriers, and two are apparently healthy at the age of 21 and 23 years. Knowledge of germline mutations may allow accurate DNA-based carrier diagnosis which is of important clinical significance for treatment strategy and control. Furthermore, the occurrence of unaffected carriers in this family raises questions about appropriate methods of cancer surveillance and counselling for these people",

We describe a patient who presented with developed adrenocortical carcinoma at age 19 months and a cerebral primitive neuroectodermal tumor at age 5 years. The patient did not have a family history of cancer. We used the enzyme mismatch cleavage (EMC) method to screen for mutations in the p53 gene and found a germline mutation in exon 7 (codon 248). Loss of heterozygosity analysis in one tumor revealed loss of the wild-type p53 allele. In our report we demonstrate the EMC method to be a rapid and sensitive method for mutation detection",

Codon 344 is a key residue within the tetramerisation domain, and the amino acid substitution of a proline for a leucine is predicted to have profound implications for tetramerisation and potentially DNA binding. This is the first report of a mutation at this residue in either sporadic tumours or in the germline and the first report of a germline mutation within the tetramerisation domain. The family does not appear to be remarkable in the spectrum of tumours, and there is loss of the wild-type allele in a leiomyosarcoma from the proband.

  "Title": "A novel p53 germline alteration identified in a late onset breast cancer kindred",
  "Abstract": "Germline mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are associated with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, characterized by childhood sarcoma, leukemia and early onset breast cancer and has occasionally been found also in familial breast-ovarian cancer. Most mutations found are of missense type and located in the central region of the gene (exons 5 to 8). In the present study, a germline p53 alteration was identified in a late onset breast cancer family (kindred Lund 5; mean age 58 years) using single stranded conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. The mutation (a CCG to CTG transition) at codon 82 in exon 4, resulting in a proline to leucine substitution, has not previously been reported and was not present in a control set of 60 healthy individuals. Three of five woman with breast cancer (45, 57 and 65 years) were carriers of the alteration. Loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus was not seen in the primary tumors of these women, but appeared as a partial loss of the wildtype allele in subsequent recurrent lesions of two gene carriers. The family manifested no linkage to the p53 gene (a two-point LOD-score of -0.41), and has previously also been excluded for linkage to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 loci, as well as being carrier of a BRCA1 germline mutation. Although it seems unlikely that the p53 germline mutation is the major cause of disease predisposition in Lund 5, the data suggest that some p53 alteration may confer a subtle influence on breast cancer development and progression",

  "Abstract": "We report a constitutional point mutation of codon 278 in exon 8 of the TP53 gene that has not yet been described as a germ-line mutation. A 52-year-old female developed multiple primary malignancies (liposarcoma, breast cancer, malignant histiocytoma, occult adenocarcinoma). The mutation found in her tumour and peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA is a cytosine to thymine transition at the second position of codon 278 resulting in an amino acid exchange from proline to leucine in the DNA-binding domain. Evaluation of the patient\u0027s family revealed that both of her sons were affected by the same mutation. Although the patient\u0027s mother had died already, we were able to demonstrate by polymorphic microsatellite analysis that the defective allele originated from the maternal side. As four brothers and one sister had inherited the same allele, which however was wild type, we were able to show that the mutation must have occurred in the germ cells of the patient\u0027s mother and that it may therefore be called de novo. This explains the lack of a high cancer incidence in the family history. All tumours tested showed positive immunohistochemical staining for p53. Loss of heterozygosity was found in five of seven tumours, one showing chromosome 17 monosomy",

  "Title": "The p53 gene in pediatric therapy-related leukemia and myelodysplasia",
  "Abstract": "We investigated the frequency of p53 mutations in 19 pediatric cases of therapy-related leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Eleven children presented with acute myeloid leukemia, one with mixed-lineage leukemia, two with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and five with myelodysplasia at times ranging from 11 months to 9 years after a primary cancer diagnosis. The primary cancers, which included 11 solid tumors and eight leukemias, were treated with various combinations of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, alkylating agents, or irradiation. Leukemic or myelodysplastic marrows were screened for possible mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of p53 exons 4 to 8. The only observed mutation was an inherited 2- basepair deletion at codon 209 in exon 6 that would shift the open reading frame, create a premature termination codon, and foreshorten the resultant protein. Prior therapy in this patient included DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, alkylating agents, and irradiation. The secondary leukemia presented as myelodysplasia with monosomies of chromosomes 5 and 7 and abnormalities of chromosome 17. Although the primary cancer was an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and there was a family history of cancer, the case did not fulfill the clinical criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. This study suggests that germline p53 mutations may predispose some children to therapy-related leukemia and myelodysplasia, but that p53 mutations otherwise are infrequent in this setting",

A missense mutation at codon 265 of TP53 was found in three patients of a family that complied with the definition of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. A nonsense mutation in codon 306 was found in a woman who had had a rhabdomyosarcoma at age 4 and a subsequent breast cancer at age 22. She was part of a Li-Fraumeni-like family, but the parental origin of the mutation could not be traced. Finally, while screening for somatic alterations in TP53 in a series of 141 sporadic breast tumors, we detected a constitutional missense mutation in codon 235 in a woman diagnosed with breast cancer at age 26 and a recurrence 4 years later. The recurrence, but not the primary tumor, showed an additional missense mutation at codon 245 as well as loss of the wild-type allele. This suggests that the 245 mutation was particularly important for tumor progression and that there might exist heterogeneity in terms of cancer predisposition potential among the various germline TP53 mutations",

  "Abstract": "Previous investigations of a Li - Fraumeni like family (Barnes et al., 1992) demonstrated that both the proband and her mother had elevated p53 protein levels in both tumour tissue and normal tissue at sites distant from the tumour, although no mutation was found in the p53 gene. In the present study two recently described functional assays for p53, an apoptotic assay and the functional assay for the separation of alleles in yeast (FASAY), have been employed to study the functional activity of p53 from this patient. The results of the apoptotic assay demonstrated that this patient had a p53 functional defect and the FASAY result suggested that this defect was in fact a germline mutation of the p53 gene. A point mutation of codon 337, which results in an amino acid substitution of a cysteine for an arginine, was demonstrated initially in cDNA and was confirmed by sequencing of genomic DNA. This is an unusual mutation as it is in the oligomerisation domain of p53, in contrast to the majority of p53 mutations which are in the core DNA binding domain. This mutation results in a protein which still retains partial transactivational activity in the FASAY. The mutation of codon 337 is only the second reported case of a germline missense mutation occurring in the oligomerisation domain of p53",

  "Abstract": "Screening for p53 mutations in exons 5 to 8 in 124 pediatric malignancies identified 18 abnormal shifts using single strand conformation polymorphism: 12 were missense mutations and in 6, no mutation was detected in the exon or in the splice donor acceptor sequences. Sequencing was then performed in the adjacent introns, revealing a G to A base substitution at 39 base pairs upstream to exon 7. This mutation was identified in the germ line of five of the patients, and also in the father of one, whose parents were available. For comparison, of the 184 normal controls similarly screened, only one had this mutation (P\u003d0.036). Positive staining of p53 protein was observed in three of the paraffin embedded tissues that were available: brain tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and lymphocytes from a normal lymph node from the rhabdomyosarcoma patient. All tumors with the identified intron mutation were Li-Fraumeni syndrome tumors. Sequencing of all exons including splice sites was performed and revealed no mutation. We suggest that this mutation in intron 6 of the p53 gene stabilizes the wild type p53 protein, resulting in its abnormal accumulation. Mutations in the noncoding region of p53 should be further studied",

Sampling was done through microdissection of frozen immunohistochemically stained 16 microm slices of tumors. From 11 BCC tumors 78 samples were analysed. Direct DNA sequencing of exons 5-8 was performed, haplotypes were determined after cloning of p53 exons and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) ascertained by microsatellite analysis. All tumors had p53 mutations and in a majority both p53 alleles were affected, commonly through missense mutations. Microdissection of small parts (50-100 cells) of individual tumors showed BCC to be composed of a dominant cell clone and prone to genetic progression with appearance of subclones with a second and even third p53 mutation. Samples from normal immunohistochemically negative epidermis always showed wild type sequence, except for a case of previously unknown germline p53 mutation. Our analysis also included p53 immunoreactive patches i.e. morphologically normal epidermis with a compact pattern of p53 immunoreactivity. Mutations within those were never the same as in the adjacent BCC. This detailed study of only one gene thus uncovered a remarkable heterogeneity within a tumor category famous for its benign clinical behavior",

On the other hand, the control of S-phase-G2 as determined by cyclin A/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity was defective in all these LCLs. The mitotic checkpoint was also defective in the two LCLs analyzed as either competent or incompetent for G1 arrest. When radiation-induced apoptosis, which requires wild-type p53 function under optimal conditions, was studied, all of these LCLs showed significant failure compared to normal LCLs. These findings indicate that although p53-dependent transactivation and G1-S-phase cell cycle control are variably dysregulated, the induction of apoptosis and control of the cell cycle at S-phase-G2 and the mitotic checkpoint in response to DNA-damaging agents are consistently dysregulated in heterozygous mutant LCLs. This suggests that these dysfunctions underlie, at least in part, the susceptibility of Li-Fraumeni syndrome families to cancer. Furthermore, the approach presented is a potentially useful method for studying individual carriers of different germ-line p53 mutations and different biological features",

  "Title": "Germ-line mutations of TP53 in Li-Fraumeni families: an extended study of 39 families",
  "Abstract": "We have previously reported on the analysis of TP53 coding mutations in 12 classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) families plus 9 families that were Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) families (J. M. Birch et al., Cancer Res., 54: 1298-1304, 1994). Mutations were found in 6 of 12 LFS families and in 1 of 9 LFL families. We have now extended these studies to include an additional nine LFS and nine LFL families, and TP53 mutations have been detected in eight of nine LFS families and in three of nine LFL families. Six of the new mutations described here are the same as those previously identified in other Li-Fraumeni families and are missense mutations at codons 245, 248, and 273 (in two families); a nonsense mutation at codon 209; and a mutation at the splice donor site in exon 4. The other five mutations are novel germ-line mutations and include missense mutations at codons 136 and 344, a 2-bp deletion within codon 191, a splice acceptor mutation in intron 3, and a 167-bp deletion of part of exon 1 and intron 1. In addition, we have detected a codon 175 mutation in a family previously reported as TP53 negative. To summarize all of the data from the families we have studied in this and our previous report (J. M. Birch et al., Cancer Res., 54: 1298-1304, 1994), mutations have been detected in 15 of 21 LFS families (71%) and in 4 of 18 LFL families (22%). These figures are somewhat higher than those previously reported by us and others for the frequency of TP53 mutations in LFS and LFL families. This could reflect our analysis of all 11 exons of TP53, including noncoding regions, as well as the use of direct sequencing rather than other less-sensitive mutation detection methods",

  "Title": "Germline p53 mutation at codon 133 in a cancer-prone family",
  "Abstract": "We identified four families in which we suspected the presence of genetic factors predisposing them to cancer. We examined one family with features suggesting Li-Fraumeni syndrome for the presence of a germline p53 mutation in 13 of its members. To detect germline p53 mutations we performed polymerase chain reaction/nonradioisotopic single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing analysis on exons 4-9 of the p53 gene. Mutated polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was also performed on exon 5 to confirm the mutation identified by the sequencing analysis. A novel germline p53 mutation was identified at codon 133 (ATG--\u003eAGG) in exon 5, resulting in the substitution of arginine for methionine, in all four cancer-affected individuals and in three apparently healthy individuals. We also analyzed tumor specimens for additional p53 mutations in the wild-type alleles using the same methods. However, heterozygosity was retained, and no other additional mutations in the wild-type allele were identified in any of the tumor tissues. It is possible that additional mutations in the wild-type allele are not always necessary for the loss of tumor suppressor functions. This study presents serious clinical and ethical problems about the predictive value of identifying germline p53 mutations in presymptomatic carriers. However, accurate predictive testing will be very useful in identifying unaffected individuals who are at increased risk of developing cancer and in detecting cancer at an early stage",

  "Title": "A novel TP53 germ-line mutation identified in a girl with a primitive neuroectodermal tumor and her father",
  "Abstract": "A search of TP53 mutations was undertaken in a series of 51 pediatric brain tumors. The only germ-line mutation was detected in a 9-year-old girl with a PNET. Her family history was unremarkable for neoplastic disease, except for the paternal grandfather, who died of a gallbladder carcinoma at an advanced age. The mutation was a thymine deletion at the first base of codon 241, leading to termination codon at position 246 that has not previously been reported. This mutation was found to be inherited from the proband\u0027s father, who was healthy at age 40. In the tumoral sample, loss of heterozygosity in several 17p markers was found, the only TP53 allele preserved in the tumor was the mutated one. The presence of two short tandem repeats and two different palindromic sequences spanning the deletion lead us to propose the predisposition of this region to forming a complex secondary structure during replication. Consequently, it could have facilitated the present deletion. Furthermore, six other short deletions affecting--partially or totally--the region implicated in the folding model that we propose have been described in the literature. These findings confirm that this sequence represents a hotspot of deletion in the TP53 gene",

  "Title": "Exclusion of a p53 germline mutation in a classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome family",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is characterized by a high risk of sarcomas, early onset of breast cancer, and a diversity of other cancers occurring as multiple primary tumors in multiple family members. In many families with LFS, germline mutations within the tumor-suppressor gene p53 have been identified. However, mutations in p53 have not been detected in approximately 30% of LFS families. To address the possibility either that p53 mutations were being missed or that another predisposing gene is altered in LFS, we used a variety of methods to accurately determine the p53 status in a large LFS kindred. A transcriptional activation assay on exons 4-10 of p53 excluded a mutation within the DNA-binding domain of p53. Single-stranded conformational-polymorphism analysis, using intronic primers and sequencing of all the coding exons and intron/exon junctions, also yielded no mutations. Finally, linkage analysis excluded potential mutations in the noncoding regions of p53. Our findings exclude the presence of a p53 germline mutation in a classic LFS family",

  "Title": "Molecular assessment of clonality leads to the identification of a new germ line TP53 mutation associated with malignant cystosarcoma phyllodes and soft tissue sarcoma",
  "Abstract": "Cystosarcoma phyllodes (CSP) is a rare breast neoplasm composed of stromal and epithelial elements. It usually runs a benign course but it may metastasize. In a 31-year-old patient with recurring CSP, a mesenchymal tumor in the leg developed. The question arose whether the latter tumor could be a metastasis from the CSP, which would have major treatment consequences. The problem was addressed using molecular methods, i.e., comparison of the pattern of polymorphic repeat markers on chromosome 17p as well as single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing of exons 5 to 8 of the TP53 gene in both tumor and normal tissue. An identical pattern of loss of heterozygosity in both breast tumors was demonstrated, but a different pattern was shown in the tumor in the leg. This led to the conclusion that the latter tumor had to be a new primary tumor. A mutation in codon 162 of the TP53 gene was found in the tumor tissue as well as in the normal tissue of this patient. This germ line mutation leads to the replacement of isoleucine by asparagine and most likely has functional consequences. In all four examined tumors of this patient, the normal TP53 allele was lost. This is strong evidence that this germ line TP53 mutation causes the genesis of these two rare primary mesenchymal tumors in this young patient. The current study exemplifies the power of molecular diagnostic methods in investigating the specific clinical problem of clonal relation between two separate tumors. The germ line mutation found in codon 162 of the TP53 gene and the association with cystosarcoma phyllodes have not been described previously",

  "Title": "Genetic and functional studies of a germline TP53 splicing mutation in a Li-Fraumeni-like family",
  "Abstract": "We report an extensive Li-Fraumeni-like family in which there is an unusual spectrum of tumours at relatively late onset. A germline TP53 splice donor mutation in exon 4 is present in all affected family members available for testing. The mutation abolishes correct splicing of intron 4 and techniques of RT-PCR have identified three different aberrant transcripts from the mutant TP53 allele. Using the yeast functional assay to analyse transcripts in cells from a number of family members with the mutant allele, TP53 appears wild-type. Functional studies have been carried out on cells from patients with and without cancer who carry the germline mutation, and on cells from unaffected individuals from the same family who do not carry the mutation. Using a number of functional endpoints known to distinguish between cells carrying mutant or wild-type TP53 alleles, we were unable to discriminate normal (wt/wt) from heterozygous (wt/mut) cells by lymphocyte apoptosis and fibroblast survival following low dose rate ionising radiation exposure. However germline mutation carriers show increased sensitivity to radiation-induced chromosome damage in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and decreased transient and permanent G1 arrest. These studies demonstrate the importance of fully characterising the effects of TP53 germline mutations, and may explain some of the phenotypic features of this family",

  "Abstract": "We report a case with a germline mutation of the p53 gene develpoing both a non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma and an astrocytoma. The astrocytoma could be cured by two operations and combined chemotherapy but 33 months after the onset of the disease, he suffered from a diffuse, large cell centroblastic malignant lymphoma of B-cell lineage. In spite of clear rearranged fragments observed with IgH and c-MYC gene probes, we could not diagnose a Burkitt\u0027s lymphoma morphologically. The malignant lymphoma was chemoresistant and the patient died of multi-organ failure. He was confirmed to have a germline mutation of the p53 gene by analysis of c-DNA from peripheral lymphocytes and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of p53 was evident in the lymphoma. The results were suggestive of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a rare autosomal dominantly inherited syndrome with a germline mutation of p53 gene and diverse malignancies, but this could not be confirmed in the present case. Alternatively, a de novo mutation could have been involved",

  "Abstract": "AWe report on two siblings (brother and sister) who developed cerebral PNETs at the age of 5 years and 6 months, respectively. Both children were treated by operation followed by polychemotherapy. The brother also received cranio-spinal irradiation. Nevertheless, the children died about 12 months and 24 months post-operatively due to extensive cerebral tumor recurrences. Shortly after having lost both of her children, the mother developed an intra-abdominal tumor, which was resected and histologically diagnosed as ovarian carcinoma. Because of this unusual familial clustering of tumors and a positive history of brain tumors and other cancers in several maternal relatives, we analyzed DNA isolated from both PNETs and the ovarian carcinoma as well as constitutional (leukocyte) DNA from the whole family for mutation of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. This analysis revealed that all tumors were homozygous for a missense mutation at codon 213 (CGA \u003d\u003e TGG) resulting in an amino acid exchange from arginine to tryptophane. The same mutation was present in one TP53 allele in the constitutional DNA of the mother and the children, indicating that the mother had transmitted a TP53 germline mutation to both of her children. Analysis of loss of heterozygosity at microsatellite markers from 17p confirmed deletion of the paternal (wild-type) allele in both PNETs. Further investigation of the PNETs by comparative genomic hybridization revealed multiple chromosomal abnormalities. Interestingly, some genomic changes were common to both PNETs, while many others were not, a finding suggesting substantial genomic instability, probably as a consequence of p53 inactivation",

Cerebral neoplasms are usually of astrocytic lineage and occur in 40% of affected families.

The youngest patient in each family developed a malignant choroid plexus tumor while several young adults of both kindred succumbed to low-grade astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma. The only non-neural neoplasm was an adrenocortical carcinoma in a boy aged 4 years who developed an anaplastic choroid plexus papilloma 2 years later. Of 2 previously reported inherited choroid plexus tumors, 1 occurred in a family which also carried a germline mutation in codon 248. It remains to be shown whether this unusual pattern of CNS tumors is due to an organ-specific effect of this particular p53 mutation or whether it reflects the genetic background of the affected families",

  "Title": "Two Li-Fraumeni syndrome families with novel germline p53 mutations: loss of the wild-type p53 allele in only 50% of tumours",
  "Abstract": "We describe two Li-Fraumeni syndrome families. Family A was remarkable for two early childhood cases of adrenocortical tumours, family B for a high incidence of many characteristic cancers, including a childhood case of choroid plexus tumour. Using direct sequencing, we analysed exons 5-9 of the p53 gene in constitutional DNA of individuals from both families and found two novel germline mutations in exon 5. In family A, we detected a point substitution in codon 138 (GCC to CCC), which resulted in the replacement of the alanine by a proline residue. Family B harboured a single-base pair deletion in codon 178 (CAC to -AC), resulting in a frameshift and premature chain termination. Three out of six tumours examined from both families, a renal cell carcinoma, a rhabdomyosarcoma and a breast cancer, showed loss of heterozygosity and contained only the mutant p53 allele. The remaining three neoplasms, both adrenocortical tumours and the choroid plexus tumour retained heterozygosity. Immunohistochemistry with anti-p53 antibody confirmed accumulation of p53 protein in tumours with loss of heterozygosity, while the remaining tumours were p53 negative. These results support the view that complete loss of activity of the wild-type p53 need not be the initial event in the formation of all tumours in Li-Fraumeni individuals",

  "Abstract": "Segmental jumping translocations are chromosomal abnormalities in treatment-related leukemias characterized by multiple copies of the ABL and/or MLL oncogenes dispersed throughout the genome and extrachromosomally. Because gene amplification potential accompanies loss of wild-type p53, we examined the p53 gene in a case of treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) with MLL segmental jumping translocation. The child was diagnosed with ganglioneuroma and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) at 2 years of age. Therapy for ERMS included alkylating agents, DNA topoisomerase I and DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, and local radiation. t-AML was diagnosed at 4 years of age. The complex karyotype of the t-AML showed structural and numerical abnormalities. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed multiple copies of the MLL gene, consistent with segmental jumping translocation. A genomic region including CD3, MLL, and a segment of band 11q24 was unrearranged and amplified by Southern blot analysis. There was no family history of a cancer predisposing syndrome, but single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis detected identical band shifts in the leukemia, ganglioneuroma, ERMS, and normal tissues, consistent with a germline p53 mutation, and there was loss of heterozygosity in the ERMS and the t-AML. Sequencing showed a CGA--\u003eTGA nonsense mutation at codon 306 in exon 8. The results of this analysis indicate that loss of wild-type p53 may be associated with genomic instability after DNA-damaging chemotherapy and radiation, manifest as a complex karyotype and gene amplification in some cases of t-AML",

  "Abstract": "We identified a novel germ-line p53 mutation in the noncoding, nonsplicing regions of a Li-Fraumeni family. Patients belonging to this family included pediatric medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma patients and a breast carcinoma patient. Three positions in the p53 gene were analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH). One of the three loci retained heterozygosity, whereas the other two exhibited LOH. Sequence analysis of the third locus identified a change of 5\u0027-CCGGGTGA-3\u0027 to 5\u0027- CCAGGTTGGA-3\u0027, 63 bp downstream of exon 6. The mutation was identified in the germ line of the two pediatric patients and in each of the related parents. We excluded any additional mutation in the entire coding region of the p53 gene, including splice-site intronic sequences. Strong positive nuclear staining of the p53 protein was detected in both normal and tumor paraffin-embedded tissues. Eighty- five normal persons were negative for this alteration, which thus supports it as a mutation. These results may indicate that genetic changes within the noncoding region of the p53 gene may serve as an alternative mechanism of activating this gene. Mutations in the noncoding region of this gene should be further studied",

Here, it is shown that heterozygous germ line mutations in hCHK2 occur in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a highly penetrant familial cancer phenotype usually associated with inherited mutations in the TP53 gene. These observations suggest that hCHK2 is a tumor suppressor gene conferring predisposition to sarcoma, breast cancer, and brain tumors, and they also provide a link between the central role of p53 inactivation in human cancer and the well-defined G2 checkpoint in yeast",

  "Abstract": "Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for a large portion of the inherited predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. It was recently discovered that mutations in these two genes are less common in the Finnish population than expected. Because the genetic background of breast cancer, in particular, is largely obscure, it became necessary to search for mutations in other susceptibility genes. Because seven of our BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative families fulfilled the criteria of either Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL), we decided to screen them for germ-line TP53 mutations in exons 5-8 using a dual-temperature single-strand conformation polymorphism assay (SSCP). Two missense mutations (Asn235Ser and Tyr220Cys) were identified. The clinical significance of these findings was evaluated by comparison to previously reported germ-line TP53 mutation data, and by using the tumor loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis. In addition, an immunohistochemical analysis of tumor specimens from mutation- positive individuals was performed. Our results suggest that the observed missense mutations confer susceptibility to cancer, and that germ-line TP53 mutations would therefore explain an additional fraction of hereditary breast cancer in Finland",

  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by various types of cancer in childhood and adult cases. Although hereditary TP53 mutation is very rare in different human cancers, it has been frequently reported in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. On the other hand, hereditary mutations of TP57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A, which affect the cell cycle similar to TP53, were observed in some types of cancer. In a Turkish family with the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, we analyzed the mutation pattern of TP53, P57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A in the peripheral blood, and loss of heterozygosity (homo/hemizygous deletion) pattern of TP53 and P15INK4B/P16INK4A in two tumor tissues. The propositus had a seminoma, his daughter a medulloblastoma, and one of his healthy cousins, a TP53 codon 292 missense point mutation (AAA--\u0026gt;ATA; Lys--\u0026gt;Ile) in the peripheral blood cells. Tumor tissue obtained from the propositus with the seminoma revealed loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene. In the analyses of tumor tissues from the propositus and his daughter, a P16INK4A codon 94 missense point mutation (GCG--\u0026gt;GAG; Ala--\u0026gt;Glu) was observed with the hereditary TP53 mutation. P16INK4A codon 94 mutation observed in our family is a novel mutation in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. No other gene alteration in TP53, P57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A was observed. Existence of the P16INK4A mutation and the hereditary TP53 mutation with or without loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene (seminoma/medulloblastoma) may be evidence for a common mechanism involved in tumorogenesis. The gene alterations in TP53 and P16INK4A genes may be used as tumor markers in our family",

  "Title": "TP53 mutation and haplotype analysis of two large African American families",
  "Abstract": "Two large apparently unrelated African American families with a high incidence of breast cancer and other tumors characteristic of Li- Fraumeni breast sarcoma cancer family syndrome were studied. Mutation screening revealed that in both families the affected members carried a germline mutation of the TP53 gene at codon 133 (ATG--\u003e ACG, M133T). In order to determine whether an ancestral haplotype was shared by these two families, polymorphic markers within and flanking the TP53 gene were studied. Haplotype analysis using five markers revealed an identical haplotype shared by the two families. Loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 locus in the probands\u0027 tumor tissues from each family was observed; in each case, the retained allele carried the common haplotype. The frequency of this haplotype in the general African American population is \u003c0.003. This unique haplotype, combined with the rare TP53 mutation, suggests that these African American families share a common ancestry. This finding suggests that other African Americans may be carriers of this mutation and thus may be at risk of early-onset breast cancer or other cancers characteristic of the Li-Fraumeni breast sarcoma cancer family syndrome. The finding of recurring mutations in African Americans may facilitate carrier screening and identification in this population. Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc",

  "Title": "Cells with TP53 mutations in low grade astrocytic tumors evolve clonally to malignancy and are an unfavorable prognostic factor",
  "Abstract": "It is important to understand how low grade tumors recur and progress to malignant lesions since this dramatically shortens patient survival. Here, we evaluated the concept that malignant progression and poor prognosis of low grade astrocytic tumors are TP53 dependent through clonal expansion of mutated cells. TP53 status was established in primary and recurrent tumors from 36 patients with WHO grade II astrocytic tumors and two tumor types were found. Tumors from 14 patients (39%; type 1) had TP53 mutated cells, and 92% of these recurred with 57% progressing to malignancy. The evolution of TP53 mutated cells before and after progression was examined using a clonal analysis procedure in yeast. Malignant progression was accompanied by an increased percentage of mutant TP53 (red) yeast colonies resulting from monoclonal expansion of cells with mutated TP53. The presence of TP53 mutations in WHO grade II astrocytic tumors was associated with malignant progression (P\u003d0. 034, chi2 test) and shorter progression- free survival (PFS; 47.6+/-9. 6 months for TP53-mutated tumors vs 67.8+/-8.2 months for TP53-wild type tumors, P\u003c0.05, log-rank test). Tumors from 22 patients (61%; type 2) were without TP53 mutations, and 64% of these recurred without a change in TP53 status, although 41% progressed to malignancy. This suggests that TP53 mutation is not an initiating or progression event in the majority of low grade astrocytic tumors. Our study also indicates that irradiation for WHO grade II astrocytic tumors might be associated with poor outcome (P\u003c0.0001) and this was independent of TP53 status. These findings have important implications in the clinical management of patients with low grade astocytoma and provide new support to the clonal evolution model for tumor progression",

  "Title": "p53 compound heterozygosity in a severely affected child with Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "The Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare, dominantly inherited syndrome that features high risk of cancers in childhood and early adulthood. Affected families tend to develop bone and soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancers, brain tumors, leukemias, and adrenocortical carcinomas. In some kindreds, the genetic abnormality associated with this cancer phenotype is a heterozygous germline mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Recently, we identified one patient who presented in early childhood with multiple primary cancers and who harbored three germline p53 alterations (R156H and R267Q on the maternal allele and R290H on the paternal allele). To classify the biologic effects of these alterations, functional properties of each of the p53 mutants were examined using in vitro assays of cellular growth suppression and transcriptional activation. Each amino acid substitution conferred partial or complete loss of wild-type p53 function, but the child completed normal embryonic development. This observation has not been previously reported in a human, but is consistent with observations of normal embryogenesis in p53-deficient mice",

  "Abstract": "We report on two patients in whom osteosarcoma occurred as second malignancy of childhood cancer. One patient had a malignant teratoma and the other adrenocortical carcinoma as the primary cancer. The emergence of cancer in cured cases and long-term survival cases of childhood cancer may result in an increase in the number of osteosarcomas seen in adolescence occurring as second malignancy. Anti-cancer drugs in large does were used for the treatment of a malignant teratoma in the former. These anti-cancer drugs may be involved in the occurrence of the second malignancy. In the latter, the patient has the germ-line mutation of p53 tumor suppressor gene, so genetic factors are presumably related to the occurrence of the second malignancy",

  "Title": "Variations of p53 in cultured fibroblasts of patients with lung cancer who have a presumed genetic predisposition",
  "Abstract": "The authors studied cultured skin fibroblasts of 64 patients with lung cancer for constitutive mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene by using polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism covering the entire coding region. The patients were considered to be genetically predisposed because lung cancer had developed in 25 of them before age 46 and because 42 of them had at least one first-degree relative with lung cancer. One mutation was detected at position 235 coding for serine instead of asparagine in the conserved DNA binding domain. The Pro/Pro genotype at codon 72 of p53, considered to harbor an increased risk for lung cancer, could not be detected with increased frequency in this study\u0027s patients. From these data, the authors conclude that constitutive variations of the p53 gene do not represent a major genetic determinant for lung cancer",

  "Title": "Are There Low-Penetrance TP53 Alleles? Evidence from Childhood Adrenocortical Tumors",
  "Abstract": "We have analyzed a panel of 14 cases of childhood adrenocortical tumors unselected for family history and have identified germline TP53 mutations in \u003e80%, making this the highest known incidence of a germline mutation in a tumor-suppressor gene in any cancer. The spectrum of germline TP53 mutations detected is remarkably limited. Analysis of tumor tissue for loss of constitutional heterozygosity, with respect to the germline mutant allele and the occurrence of other somatic TP53 mutations, indicates complex sequences of genetic events in a number of tumors. None of the families had cancer histories that conformed to the criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome, but, in some families, we were able to demonstrate that the mutation had been inherited. In these families there were gene carriers unaffected in their 40s and 50s, and there were others with relatively late-onset cancers. These data provide evidence that certain TP53 alleles confer relatively low penetrance for predisposition to the development of cancer, and they imply that deleterious TP53 mutations may be more frequent in the population than has been estimated previously. Our findings have considerable implications for the clinical management of children with andrenocortical tumors and their parents, in terms of both genetic testing and the early detection and treatment of tumors",

  "Title": "Multiple primary tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract: is there a role for constitutional mutations in the p53 gene?",
  "Abstract": "Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) patients have a high risk of developing second primary tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract, the main cause of death. Although the roles of tobacco and diet in multiple head-and- neck carcinogenesis have been thoroughly investigated, little is known about individual genetic susceptibility factors involved in this process. Genomic instability, reflecting the propensity and the susceptibility of the genome to acquire multiple alterations, could be considered a driving force behind multiple carcinogenesis. Mutation of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene has been proposed to play an important role in this process. Therefore, we evaluated the incidence of inherited p53 germ-line alteration(s) in a population of 24 consecutive HNC patients and their first-degree relatives affected by multiple malignancies as well as the occurrence of p53 somatic acquired mutation(s) in 16 cancers, including first and second primaries from 5 HNCs of the same group. Mutations in exons 4-11 of the p53 gene were investigated using SSCP-PCR analysis and DNA sequencing. Analysis was extended to the peripheral blood and cancer biopsies available from first-degree relatives of cancer-prone families with p53 germ-line mutations. p53 germ-line mutations were identified in the peripheral blood and corresponding cancers of 3 HNC patients who had multiple malignancies. The only missense mutation detected was mapped in exon 6; it is a GTG to GAG substitution with an amino acid change from Val to Glu at codon 197. The remaining 2 p53 germ-line mutations were single- nucleotide substitutions without amino acid change in exon 6 (codon 213, CGA to CGG) and in exon 8 (codon 295, CCT to CCC), respectively. These mutations were found in HNC patients with a family history of cancer. Abnormal expression of wild-type p53 protein in normal and pathological tissues from patients with the same sense single- nucleotide substitutions was detected by immuno-histochemistry",

  "Title": "Pediatric adrenocortical tumors: molecular events leading to insulin- like growth factor II gene overexpression",
  "Abstract": "It has been previously shown that adrenocortical tumors (ACT) in adults exhibit structural abnormalities in tumor DNA in approximately 30% of cases. These abnormalities involve chromosome 11p15 and include loss of heterozygosity, paternal isodisomy, and overexpression of the gene for insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2), correlating with DNA demethylation at this locus. It has been hypothesized that these events occur late in the tumorigenic process in adults and seem to correlate with a worse prognosis. We present 4 pediatric cases of ACT diagnosed at 2.5 yr, 10 months, 12 yr, and 2.2 yr. All 4 patients presented with virilization, and 1 patient also showed signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid excess. The youngest patient\u0027s maternal aunt had surgical excision of a more than 15-cm ACT 18 yr previously, but the aunt is doing well at age 23 yr. They all had surgical removal of their tumors. The 2.5-yr-old child also received chemotherapy and radiotherapy because of capsular rupture and, after 3 local recurrences, died 3.3 yr after initial presentation. We investigated all 4 tumors for chromosome 11 structural abnormalities (11p15.5 to 11q23), IGF2 and H19 expression by competitive RT-PCR analysis, and IGF2 methylation patterns by Southern analysis. All 4 tumors (100%) showed a combination of structural abnormalities at the 11p15 locus with mosaic loss of heterozygosity involving 11p. All tumors also had significantly increased IGF2 messenger ribonucleic acid levels relative to normal adrenal (up to 36-fold) and significant IGF2 demethylation (mean, 87%). H19 messenger ribonucleic acid levels were undetectable in 3 of 4 tumors, explained in part by mosaic loss of the actively expressed maternal allele for this imprinted gene. By immunohistochemistry we were able to confirm increased IGF-II peptide levels within the tumor tissue in 10 pediatric patients, including the 4 patients described above. Concomitantly, we also observed nuclear accumulation of p53, suggesting somatic mutations. For the 10-month-old patient, sequencing revealed a p53 germline mutation. We therefore conclude that in pediatric ACT, structural abnormalities of tumor DNA and IGF2 overexpression as well as p53 mutations are very common and are therefore less useful for prognosis than in adults. Our findings support the theory that pediatric ACT, whose IGF2 expression and steroidogenesis evoke the phenotype of the fetal adrenal cortex, may arise because of defective apoptosis",

  "Title": "High frequency of recurrent mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in Polish families with breast and ovarian cancer",
  "Abstract": "Germ-line mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes result in a significantly increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Other genes involved in an increased predisposition to breast cancer include the TP53 gene, mutated in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. To estimate the frequency of germ-line mutations in these three genes in Upper Silesia, we have analyzed 47 breast/ovarian cancer families from that region. We found five different disease predisposing mutations in 17 (36%) families. Twelve families (25.5%) carried known BRCA1 mutations (5382insC and C61G), four families (8.5%) carried novel BRCA2 mutations (9631delC and 6886delGAAAA), and one family (2%) harbored novel mutation 1095del8 in the TP53 gene, which is the largest germline deletion in coding sequence of this gene identified thus far. The 5382insC mutation in BRCA1 was found in 11 families and the 9631delC mutation in BRCA2 occurred in three families. These two mutations taken together contribute to 82% of all mutations found in this study, and 30% of the families investigated harbor one of these mutations. The very high frequency of common mutations observed in these families can only be compared to that reported for Ashkenazi Jewish, Icelandic, and Russian high-risk families. This frequency, however, may not be representative for the entire Polish population. The observed distribution of mutations will favor routine pre-screening of predisposed families using a simple and cost-effective test",

  "Abstract": "Germline mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene predispose to a variety of cancers in families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Most germline p53 mutations observed to date cause amino acid substitutions in the protein\u0027s central sequence-specific DNA binding domain. Outside this conserved core region, however, we found novel alterations in sequences that regulate precursor mRNA splicing in three Li-Fraumeni syndrome families. Two splice site mutations affected the consensus sequence at the splice donor sites of introns 1 and 9, and produced unstable variant transcripts in normal cells. A third mutation at the splice acceptor site of intron 9 generated splicing at a cryptic acceptor site in intron 9. These splice site alterations emphasize the need to examine both noncoding and untranslated regions of the p53 gene for germline mutations in Li-Fraumeni syndrome families.

  "Title": "A double germline mutations in the APC and p53 genes",
  "Abstract": "Germline mutation in the APC gene is required for the initiation of the development of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). According to Fearon and Vogelstein model, further somatic mutations in the K-ras oncogene, DCC gene and p53 tumor suppressor gene are prerequisite for development of colon carcinoma. We have found that the germline mutations in the DNA isolated from lymphocytes of an 18 years old girl with extraordinary expressive phenotype in codons 1060-1061 of the APC gene result in truncation of the APC protein. The mutation in codons 12 and 13 of the K-ras oncogene was not detected, but another germline mutation was found in codon 210 of the p53 gene. Furthermore, no one of these germline mutations was detected in the DNA of peripheral blood lymphocytes of the patient\u0027s 21 years old healthy sister. Until now, there has been no evidence about the expressive phenotype due to mutation in codons 1060-1061 of the APC gene; the role of germline missense mutation in codon 210 of the p53 gene in the FAP malignant process remains to be elucidated too. The effect of the combination of germline mutation in two different tumor suppressor genes in the progress of disease is discussed",

  "Title": "Elevated frequency and functional activity of a specific germ-line p53 intron mutation in familial breast cancer",
  "Abstract": "Previous studies have determined that the frequency of germ-line p53 mutations in familial breast cancer patients is 1% or less, but these reports have not investigated the importance of polymorphic intron base changes in the p53 gene. Therefore, we investigated the frequency of both exon and intron germ-line p53 base changes in 42 breast cancer patients with a strong family history of breast cancer. The mean age of presentation of these patients was 44.0 years (range, 29-69), and 12 of 42 (29%) were of known Ashkenazi ancestry. Purified DNA obtained from the 42 index cases was screened for germ-line p53 mutations in exons 2- 11 and surrounding introns using a combination of intron based primers for PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, direct sequencing, and microarray sequencing using the Affymetrix p53 gene chip methodology. Morphological analysis of apoptosis and cell survival determination were performed on EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines from two patients with the p53 intron 6 mutation. A germ-line mutation in the p53 gene at nucleotide 13964 with a G to C base change (13964GC) was identified in 3 of 42 (7.1%) hereditary breast cancer patients. Two patients were heterozygous for this mutation, and one patient had a homozygous mutation. In comparison, 0 of 171 (0%) of sporadic breast cancer patients had the p53 13964GC mutation (P \u003d 0.0003). We found that 0 of 42 (0%) of these hereditary breast cancer patients had other germ-line p53 mutation in exons 2-11. However, pedigree analysis demonstrated that all three patients had strong family histories of multiple types of cancers consistent with Li- Fraumeni syndrome but with late age of onset. Comprehensive BRCA1 and BRCA2 nucleotide analysis from patients with the p53 13964GC mutation revealed no concomitant deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, although they were found in the other hereditary breast cancer patients. Functional analysis of two immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from patients with the p53 13964GC mutation demonstrated prolonged in vitro survival in response to cisplatinum treatment and showed decreased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Immunohistochemical analysis of breast tumors from these patients revealed high levels of mutant p53 protein, suggesting a functional mutation in the p53 gene. In summary, we have identified a single p53 intron mutation in familial breast cancer patients that is present at elevated frequency and has functional activity",

  "Abstract": "The family history of cancer in children treated for a solid malignant tumour in the Paediatric Oncology Department at Institute Gustave- Roussy, has been investigated. In order to determine the role of germline p53 mutations in genetic predisposition to childhood cancer, germline p53 mutations were sought in individuals with at least one relative (first- or second-degree relative or first cousin) affected by any cancer before 46 years of age, or affected by multiple cancers. Screening for germline p53 mutation was possible in 268 index cases among individuals fulfilling selection criteria. Seventeen (6.3%) mutations were identified, of which 13 were inherited and four were de novo. Using maximum likelihood methods that incorporate retrospective family data and correct for ascertainment bias, the lifetime risk of cancer for mutation carriers was estimated to be 73% for males and nearly 100% for females with a high risk of breast cancer accounting for the difference. The risk of cancer associated with such mutations is very high and no evidence of low penetrance mutation was found. These mutations are frequently inherited but de novo mutations are not rare",

  "Title": "Investigation of germline PTEN, p53, p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF), and CDK4 alterations in familial glioma",
  "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest that some familial aggregations of glioma may be due to inherited predisposition. Many genes involved in familial cancers are frequently altered in the corresponding sporadic forms. We have investigated several genes known to be altered in sporadic gliomas for their potential contribution to familial glioma. Fifteen glioma patients with a family history of brain tumors were identified through the Mayo Clinic Department of Neurology (nine diffuse astrocytomas, two oligodendrogliomas, two mixed oligoastrocytomas, one pilocytic astrocytoma, and one pineal glioma). Eleven of the propositi had one or more first degree relative with a glioma. Lymphocyte DNA was derived from each of the patients and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing of the PTEN, p53, p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF), and CDK4 genes. In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on EBV- transformed lymphocytes from each affected individual to detect germline copy number of the p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF) tumor suppressor region. A p53 germline point mutation was identified in one family with some findings of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and a hemizygous germline deletion of the p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF) tumor suppressor region was demonstrated by FISH in a family with history of both astrocytoma and melanoma. Thus, whereas germ-line mutations of PTEN, p53, p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF), and CDK4 are not common events in familial glioma, outside of familial cancer syndromes, point mutations of p53 and hemizygous deletions and other rearrangements of the p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF) tumor suppressor region may account for a subset of familial glioma cases. Collectively, these data lend genetic support to the heritable nature of some cases of glioma. Copyright 2000 Wiley- Liss, Inc",

  "Title": "Identification of a novel PTEN intronic deletion in Li-Fraumeni syndrome and its effect on RNA processing",
  "Abstract": "Germline mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene account for the predisposition to cancer observed in many Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) families. A causative genetic factor in the remaining families that harbor no TP53 mutations remains to be elucidated. The PTEN phosphatase tumor suppressor gene is mutated in human cancers observed in LFS. There also exists some phenotypic overlap in the occurrence of cancers in LFS and Cowden\u0027s disease (CD), for which germline PTEN mutations are believed to be responsible. We hypothesized that PTEN may be altered in some TP53-wild-type LFS families. We examined LFS primary patient lymphocytes for PTEN alterations using SSCP and sequence analysis. A novel intronic deletion was found in two unrelated individuals, adjacent to the splice acceptor site of PTEN exon 4. Based on an in vitro mRNA processing assay this alteration is predicted to be a polymorphism. The in vivo effects of this proximal splice site deletion are unknown and a genetic cause for the cancers in these families remains to be elucidated. Germline mutations of PTEN were not detected in other families, suggesting that alterations of this tumor suppressor gene do not account for the cancers observed in the subset of LFS individuals with wild-type germline TP53",

These data indicate that a significant proportion of TP53 germline mutations are currently unrecognized.

  "Title": "Tissue-specific expression of SV40 in tumors associated with the Li- Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Inactivation of wild-type p53 tumor suppressor function is the primary mechanism of tumor initiation in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) individuals with germline p53 mutations. Tumors derived from LFS patients frequently retain the normal p53 allele, suggesting that alternative mechanisms in addition to gene deletion must be involved in inactivating wild-type p53 protein. DNA tumor viruses, such as SV40, target p53 for inactivation through the action of viral oncoproteins. We studied the probands from two unrelated LFS families, each of whom presented with multiple malignant neoplasms. Patient 1 developed an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and a choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC), while patient 2 developed a CPC and subsequently presented with both an osteosarcoma (OS) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We utilized DNA sequence analysis and immunohistochemistry to determine p53 gene status in the germline and tumors, as well as evidence for SV40 T-antigen oncoprotein expression. Each patient harbored a heterozygous germline p53 mutation at codons 175 and 273, respectively. In patient 1, the normal p53 gene was lost while the mutant p53 allele was reduced to homozygosity in the RMS. Both normal and mutant genes were maintained in the CPC. In patient 2, normal and mutant p53 alleles were retained in both the CPC and RCC. Both specific PCR and immunostaining detected SV40 T-antigen in both CPCs and the RCC. In addition to chromosomal alterations, epigenetic mechanisms may disrupt p53 function during tumorigenesis. In two LFS patients, we found SV40 DNA sequences and viral T-antigen expression that could account for inactivation of the normal p53 protein. Inactivation of p53 or other tumor suppressors by viral proteins may contribute to tumor formation in specific tissues of genetically susceptible individuals",

  "Abstract": "We report a case of multiple primary cancers having a germline missense mutation of the p53 gene. The patient was a Japanese female and had a history of five different types of cancers.

This is the first case of germline p53 mutation at codon 106, and could contribute to establishing correlations between the types and locations of germline p53 mutations and their phenotypical consequences",

  "Abstract": "Germ-line mutations in the p53 gene predispose individuals to Li- Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). The cell cycle checkpoint kinases CHK1 and CHK2 act upstream of p53 in DNA damage responses, and recently rare germ-line mutations in CHK2 were reported in LFS families. We have analyzed CHK1, CHK2, and p53 genes for mutations in 44 Finnish families with LFS, Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome, or families phenotypically suggestive of LFS with conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis. Five different disease-causing mutations were observed in 7 families (7 of 44 families; 15.9%): 4 in the p53 gene (5 of 44 families; 11.4%) and 1 in the CHK2 gene (2 of 44 families; 4.5%). Interestingly, the other CHK2-mutation carrier also has a mutation in the MSH6 gene. The cancer phenotype in the CHK2-families was not characteristic of LFS, and may indicate variable phenotypic expression in the rare families with CHK2 mutations. No mutations in the CHK1 gene were identified. Additional work is necessary to completely unravel the molecular background of LFS",

  "Title": "Destabilization of CHK2 by a missense mutation associated with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Li Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a multicancer phenotype, most commonly associated with germ-line mutations in TP53. In a kindred with LFS without an inherited TP53 mutation, we have previously reported a truncating mutation (1100delC) in CHK2, encoding a kinase that phosphorylates p53 on Ser(20). Here, we describe a CHK2 missense mutation (R145W) in another LFS family. This mutation destabilizes the encoded protein, reducing its half-life from \u003e120 min to 30 min. This effect is abrogated by treatment of cells with a proteosome inhibitor, suggesting that CHK2(R145W) is targeted through this degradation pathway. Both 1100delC and R145W germ-line mutations in CHK2 are associated with loss of the wild-type allele in the corresponding tumor specimens, and neither tumor harbors a somatic TP53 mutation. Our observations support the functional significance of CHK2 mutations in rare cases of LFS and suggest that such mutations may substitute for inactivation of TP53",

  "Title": "An inherited mutation outside the highly conserved DNA-binding domain of the p53 tumor suppressor protein in children and adults with sporadic adrenocortical tumors",
  "Abstract": "Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the single most common genetic alterations in human cancers. Recently, a distinct nucleotide substitution was identified in exon 10 of the p53 gene, leading to an Arg337His mutation in 97% of children with adrenocortical tumors from Southern Brazil. In the present study, we investigated the presence of this mutation in a larger series of 55 patients (37 adults and 18 children) with benign and malignant sporadic adrenocortical tumors. None of the patients had family cancer histories that conformed to the criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Twenty-one asymptomatic close relatives of patients with p53 mutations and 60 normal unrelated individuals were also studied. The missense Arg337His mutation was identified in 19 patients (14 children and 5 adults), and 8 of 11 cases studied had LOH. Among the 19 patients with the Arg337His mutation, only one boy and three adults showed fatal evolution or recurrent metastases. This mutation was also identified in heterozygous state in asymptomatic first-degree relatives of the patients, indicating that Arg337His mutation was inherited in most cases. In contrast, this mutation was not found in 120 alleles of normal unrelated controls. In conclusion, the germ line Arg337His mutation of p53 protein is present at a high frequency (77.7%) in children with benign or malignant sporadic adrenocortical tumors, but it is not restricted to the pediatric group, since 13.5% of adults with adrenocortical tumors also had this mutation. The presence of this mutation was related to unfavorable prognosis in most of the adults, but not in the children with adrenocortical tumors",

  "Title": "Comparative analysis of the NF2, TP53, PTEN, KRAS, NRAS and HRAS genes in sporadic and radiation-induced human meningiomas",
  "Abstract": "Irradiation to the head is associated with a significantly increased incidence of meningiomas. Radiation-induced meningiomas morphologically resemble their sporadically arising counterparts; however, they frequently exhibit a more malignant phenotype. Several genes have been shown to carry mutations in meningiomas, with the NF2 gene being most frequently affected. To examine whether the NF2 gene also plays a role in the development of radiation-induced meningiomas, we compiled a series of meningiomas from 25 patients with a history of previous cranial radiation. This series was compared with 21 atypical WHO grade II meningiomas and 15 anaplastic WHO grade III meningiomas, all from patients without a history of prior irradiation. NF2 mutations occurred significantly more often in sporadic atypical and anaplastic than in radiation-induced meningiomas (p \u003c 0.02). In addition, all meningiomas were examined for mutations in the PTEN, TP53, HRAS, KRAS and NRAS genes. Two mutations in the TP53 gene in a sporadic and a radiation- induced tumor were detected. PTEN mutations were observed in 1 anaplastic and 1 radiation-induced meningioma. No structural alterations were seen in the RAS genes. Our data suggest that, while there is a certain overlap in the mutational spectrum, NF2 mutations may not play such a prominent role in the pathogenesis of radiation- induced compared to sporadic meningiomas",

  "Title": "An inherited p53 mutation that contributes in a tissue-specific manner to pediatric adrenal cortical carcinoma",
  "Abstract": "The incidence of pediatric adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) in southern Brazil is 10-15 times higher than that of pediatric ACC worldwide. Because childhood ACC is associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, we examined the cancer history and p53 status of 36 Brazilian patients and their families. Remarkably, 35 of 36 patients had an identical germ-line point mutation of p53 encoding an R337H amino acid substitution. Differences within intragenic polymorphic markers demonstrated that at least some mutant alleles arose independently, thus eliminating a founder effect. In tumor cells, the wild-type allele was deleted, and mutant p53 protein accumulated within the nuclei. Although these features are consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome-associated adrenal tumors, there was no history of increased cancer incidence among family members. Therefore, this inherited R337H p53 mutation represents a low-penetrance p53 allele that contributes in a tissue-specific manner to the development of pediatric ACC",

  "Abstract": "We undertook the genetic analysis of a classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) family with clustering of primary tumours including two maxillary sarcomas, a rare LFS site of tumour occurrence. Our aim was to investigate the presence of a specific type of TP53 mutation that could be associated with this unusual predilection of site for cancer occurrence. Mutational screening of the coding region of TP53 revealed an A\u003eT transversion in codon 144 of exon 5 (CAG\u003eCTG, Gln\u003eLeu) in the germline of one of the three affected members, with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumour tissue. All other affected members were negative for germline or somatic TP53 mutations. TP53 immunohistochemistry was uninformative. The mutation we report is a de novo constitutional TP53 mutation that has not been previously described in the literature. It could explain the more burdened phenotype of the affected patient (died at 21 months). Alternative mechanisms to explain the overall family phenotype are discussed",

  "Title": "Analysis of TP53 germline mutations in pediatric tumor patients using DNA microarray-based sequencing technology",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whereas in sporadic human malignancies mutations of the TP53 tumor-suppressor gene occur in cancers of almost every organ and histologic subtype, patients with an inborn TP53 defect are at high risk to develop, in particular, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors, leukaemias, adrenocortical tumors, and breast cancer. To demonstrate the usefulness of microarray technology applied to TP53 sequencing in pediatric tumors, we investigated young patients suffering from tumors typical of the Li-Fraumeni context who were, therefore, candidates for harboring inborn defects in tumor-suppressor genes. PROCEDURE: Six individuals were studied, including typical Li-Fraumeni patients as well as patients without any family history of cancer. DNA samples were independently analyzed for TP53 mutations by GeneChip and standard automated laser fluorescence (ALF) sequencing technology. RESULTS: The tumor and corresponding constitutional DNA samples clearly showed identical mutations which were confirmed by ALF sequencing. All coding exons (exons 2-11) of TP53 were analyzed simultaneously. The entire sequencing procedure and data analysis was carried out within 24 hr. CONCLUSIONS: The GeneChip TP53-sequencing assay may be feasible for routine molecular genetic diagnostics in determining the TP53 status of childhood-tumor patients and in enabling a disease management based on the genetic background of the individual",

  "Title": "Investigations on a clinically and functionally unusual and novel germline p53 mutation",
  "Abstract": "This report describes an individual with a rare choroid plexus papilloma in adulthood (age 29) after earlier having an osteosarcoma (age 22). The results from this study, and others, suggest that it may be advisable to consider the possibility of a germline p53 mutation in adults presenting with choroid plexus tumours. In the current study automated DNA sequencing of genomic DNA detected a novel germline 7 base pair insertion in exon 5 of the p53 gene in this patient. The alteration in frame would produce amino acid substitutions beginning with alanine to glycine at position 161 and a stop codon at position 182 in the mutated protein. Surprisingly two assays of p53 function gave apparently wild-type results on peripheral blood lymphocytes from this individual. These results led us to carry out more detailed functional tests on the mutant protein. The mutant allele was expressed either at very low levels or not at all in phytohaemagglutinin stimulated lymphocytes. Further, the mutant protein was completely non- functional in terms of its ability to transactivate a series of p53- responsive genes (p21(WAF1), bax, PIG3), to transrepress a target gene and to inhibit colony growth in transfected Saos-2 cells. However, surprisingly, data from irradiated peripheral blood lymphocytes and transfected Saos-2 cells, suggested that this truncated, mutant protein retains significant ability to induce apoptosis",

Germline mutations in gene TP53 are identified in a percentage of affected families. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Eight families with aggregation of childhood sarcomas, brain tumors, breast cancers in pre-menopausal women, and renal tumors were screened for TP53 germ-line mutations. SSCP and posterior direct sequencing were performed for genetic analysis. We also report a previously undescribed family with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome carrying a germline mutation. RESULTS: Seven families fulfilled so-called Li-Fraumeni like criteria and one fulfilled classical criteria. A new germ-line mutation in codon 238 at exon 7 of the gene TP53 was identified in the family fulfilling classical criteria. This mutation has not been previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical heterogeneity as well as the molecular complexity and consequences of mutation analysis and genetic counseling make it necessary to develop protocols in this area. A multidisciplinary approach is needed; this approach should be coordinated by a Familial Cancer Genetic Counseling Unit",

  "Title": "p53 Germline mutation in a patient with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome and three metachronous malignancies",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE. Germline mutations of the p53 coding region are present in approximately 50-70% of patients with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), a rare hereditary disorder of familial and intraindividual clustering of different malignancies such as sarcoma (index tumor), breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemias, and adrenocortical carcinomas, the latter usually in young children. Both onset and spectrum of malignancies in individuals with LFS are thus heterogenous and may, less frequently, also include other epithelial and mesenchymal tumors. A 32-year-old female presented for genetic counseling with a history of leiomyosarcoma at age 22, malignant melanoma (a rare component of LFS) at age 26, and breast cancer at age 30. All three tumors had been treated surgically. Astrocytoma and breast cancer, respectively, had been diagnosed in her brother and mother before age 30. Other malignancies diagnosed early in life in relatives of the mother were: prostate cancer, stomach cancer, and carcinoma of the larynx. METHODS. Upon written informed consent, DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the proband, and p53 exons 4-8 analyzed for mutations by SSCP and DNA sequencing. RESULTS. A G:C to A:T mutation at codon 175 of p53 resulting in an arginine --\u003e histidine substitution was detected, confirming the clinical diagnosis of LFS. CONCLUSIONS. The patient and her family are being followed further, but testing of her children for the presence of this mutation is currently being withheld. The difficulties in the management and treatment of patients with this clinically heterogenous disorder are discussed",

  "Title": "A Li-Fraumeni syndrome family with retained heterozygosity for a germline TP53 mutation in two tumors",
  "Abstract": "We identified a missense germline mutation (Gly245Ser) in one of the mutation hot spots of the TP53 gene in two affected members of a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family. We also analyzed their tumors, a liposarcoma and a colorectal carcinoma. Both tumors exhibited p53 protein accumulation but none of them showed loss of the wild-type allele of the TP53 gene. We reviewed all published cases of tumors in germline TP53 mutation carriers where loss of heterozygosity data were available and identified 84 tumors with loss of the wild-type allele, 57 tumors with retention of heterozygosity, and 9 tumors with loss of the allele harboring the germline mutation. Among the tumors showing p53 accumulation, we observed a significant difference in the fraction of tumors showing p53 protein accumulation between the tumors with loss of the wild-type allele and those with retention of TP53 heterozygosity. This supports the idea that the pathogenesis of tumors in germline TP53 mutation carriers does not have to be associated with loss of the wild-type TP53 allele. The product of the normal allele can potentially be inactivated by a variety of other mechanisms or, as suggested by the analysis, many of these tumors may even preserve the activity of the wild-type p53 protein",

  "Abstract": "To characterize cancer risk in heterozygous p53 mutation carriers, we analyzed cancer incidence in 56 germline p53 mutation carriers and 3,201 noncarriers from 107 kindreds ascertained through patients with childhood soft-tissue sarcoma who were treated at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. We systematically followed members in these kindreds for cancer incidence for \u003e20 years and evaluated their p53 gene status. We found seven kindreds with germline p53 mutations that include both missense and truncation mutation types. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed similar cancer risks between 21 missense and 35 truncation p53 mutation carriers (log-rank chi(2)\u003d0.04; P\u003d.84). We found a significantly higher cancer risk in female carriers than in male carriers (log-rank chi(2)\u003d12.1; P\u003c.001), a difference not explained by an excess of sex-specific cancer. The calculated standardized incidence ratio (SIR) showed that mutation carriers had a risk for all types of cancer that was much higher than that for the general population (SIR \u003d 41.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 29.9-55.0) whereas noncarriers had a risk for all types of cancer that was similar to that in the general population (SIR \u003d 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-1.0). The calculated SIRs showed a \u003e100-fold higher risk of sarcoma, female breast cancer, and hematologic malignancies for the p53 mutation carriers and agreed with the findings of an earlier segregation analysis based on the same cohort. These results quantitatively illustrated the spectrum of cancer risk in germline p53 mutation carriers and will provide valuable reference for the evaluation and treatment of patients with cancer",

  "Title": "Leukemic and non-leukemic lymphocytes from patients with Li Fraumeni syndrome demonstrate loss of p53 function, Bcl-2 family dysregulation and intrinsic resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs but not flavopiridol",
  "Abstract": "Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is characterised by a predisposition to the early onset of certain tumors and is associated with germline mutation of the anti-oncogene p53. In this study we analysed the in vitro responses of lymphocytes from two LFS patients to chemotherapeutic drugs in terms of apoptosis induction and the expression of key intracellular proteins that regulate this process. One of the LFS patients also suffered from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and hence presented with a light-chain restricted B-cell lymphocytosis while the other patient had entirely normal blood counts. The B-lymphocytes from both LFS patients showed a marked degree of resistance to chlorambucil and fludarabine when compared to age-matched controls but were remarkably sensitive to the novel flavone, flavopiridol. Loss of function of p53 was demonstrated by a failure to induce Bax and p21 protein expression. In addition, altered basal expression patterns of Bcl-2 and Bax, two key regulators of apoptosis, were found in the LFS lymphocytes when compared with controls. These results suggest that LFS lymphocytes carrying a p53 mutation show intrinsic resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and this is associated with dysregulation of Bcl-2 family proteins. Furthermore, The innate resistance profile was similar in leukemic and non-leukemic lymphocytes and was therefore independent of genetic changes acquired during malignant transformation. Novel agents that induce p53-independent cell killing may be useful not only in the treatment of LFS-associated tumors but also drug resistant tumors in general where p53 and/or Bcl-2 family dysregulation is a feature",

  "Title": "TP53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 Tumor Suppressor Genes Are Not Commonly Mutated in Survivors of Hodgkin\u0027s Disease With Second Primary Neoplasms",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite recognition that second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) contribute significantly to mortality after the successful treatment of Hodgkin\u0027s disease (HD), little is known about the molecular events leading to secondary tumors. Factors contributing to second cancer risk include the carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation and chemotherapy, in combination with possible host susceptibility. To clarify whether host genetic factors contribute to secondary tumorigenesis, we performed mutational analyses of the TP53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes in a cohort of 44 HD patients developing one or more SMN. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Family cancer histories and constitutional DNA samples were obtained from 44 HD patients with SMNs identified. Using DNA-based sequencing, we evaluated the TP53 gene in all 44 patients. Nineteen female patients developing one or more secondary breast cancer were also analyzed for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer-susceptibility genes. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (43%) had more than one SMN, and 12 patients (27%) had a positive family history of cancer. One of 44 patients tested for TP53 harbored a novel homozygous germline abnormality. One of 19 patients tested for BRCA2 carried a previously described heterozygous inactivating mutation. We identified no germline BRCA1 mutations. CONCLUSION: Despite features suggestive of genetic predisposition, the TP53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 genes were not frequently mutated in this cohort of HD patients developing SMNs. Larger studies of these genes or investigations of other genes involved in cellular DNA damage response pathways may identify host genetic factors that contribute to secondary tumorigenesis",

  "Title": "Screening for TP53 rearrangements in families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome reveals a complete deletion of the TP53 gene",
  "Abstract": "The absence of detectable germline TP53 mutations in a fraction of families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) has suggested the involvement of other genes, but this hypothesis remains controversial. The density of Alu repeats within the TP53 gene led us to search genomic rearrangements of TP53 in families without detectable TP53 mutation. To this aim, we adapted the quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF) method to the analysis of the 11 exons of TP53. We analysed 98 families, either fulfilling (six families) or partially meeting (92 families) the criteria for LFS, and in which classical methods had failed to reveal TP53 alterations. We identified, in a large family fulfilling the criteria for LFS, a complete heterozygous deletion of TP53. Additional QMPSF analyses indicated that this deletion, which partially removed the centromeric FLJ10385 locus, covered approximately 45 kb. This deletion was shown to result from a complex rearrangement involving two distinct Alu-mediated recombinations. We conclude that TP53 germline rearrangements occur as rare events, but must be considered in LFS families without detectable point TP53 mutation",

  "Title": "Genetic and epigenetic alterations of the cell cycle regulators and tumor suppressor genes in pediatric osteosarcomas",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To analyze the genetic and epigenetic alterations affecting the RB1, TP53, p16INK4, and p21WAF1 tumor suppressor genes, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 3q and 18q, and the clinical variables of a series of Spanish children with osteosarcoma. These genetic changes were tested for an association with prognosis. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples and clinical data were available from 76 patients with osteosarcoma. Paired tissue was available from 41 of them. The mutation and methylation status of p16INK4, p21WAF1, TP53, and RB1 was screened as well as LOH at 3q and 18q. RESULTS: Loss of heterozygosity affecting RB1 (37.2%), TP53 (42.3%), and 18q (30.8%) and TP53 mutation (39%) were frequently encountered. TP53 mutation was associated with diagnosis at a later age. RB1 alteration was associated with reduced survival and event-free survival. The clinical variables associated with poor prognosis were the presence of metastasis at diagnosis (P \u003d 0.035) or during treatment (P \u003d 0.016) and the chondroblastic histologic subtype (P \u003d 0.007); the response to induction chemotherapy (\u003c90% necrosis) also tended to be related to poor prognosis (P \u003d 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: RB1, TP53, and possibly other tumor suppressor genes located at 18q and other localizations are involved in pediatric osteosarcoma carcinogenesis, together with other genetic alterations not fully understood to date. Based on these results, the presence of an altered RB1 gene should be regarded as a poor prognostic factor for pediatric osteosarcoma",

  "Title": "A novel case with germline p53 gene mutation having concurrent multiple primary colon tumours",
  "Abstract": "During a search for causative genes in patients with concurrent multiple primary colon tumours, we found a novel case with a germline mutation of the p53 gene, from GCC (Ala) to GTC (Val) at codon 189. Of the six primary colon tumours that this patient had, one large advanced carcinoma exhibited a somatic p53 mutation and a somatic APC mutation, in addition to the germline p53 mutation. Two early carcinomas and three adenomas had somatic APC mutations but no somatic p53 mutation or loss of the p53 allele. K-ras-2 mutations were detected in an advanced carcinoma and an early carcinoma. The present results suggest that a patient with a certain type of germline p53 mutation is predisposed to concurrent multiple colon tumours. It is also suggested that in such a patient, a somatic APC mutation is involved in tumour formation and that an additional somatic p53 mutation contributes to tumour progression",

  "Title": "Familial sarcoma: challenging pedigrees",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Partially due to the rare occurrence of soft tissue and osteogenic sarcomas in the general population, scant attention has been given to their hereditary etiology. Their overall poor prognosis might be ameliorated through an understanding of their environmental and hereditary causal factors, and/or their interactions, thereby contributing to earlier diagnosis and even the development of molecularly based targeted therapy. METHODS: The authors selected 10 sarcoma-prone families from their extensive hereditary cancer-prone family resource and focused on their challenging diagnostic, surveillance, and management features. The family study protocol included the compilation of a detailed family history of malignant disease of all anatomic sites and the collection of all available primary medical and pathology documents for verification. Genetic counseling was provided before DNA collection and at disclosure of results. RESULTS: These families displayed marked phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity. In one of these families, 16 relatives had sarcomas, with 2 of the 16 each having 2 metachronous sarcomas; to our knowledge, this represents the greatest number of sarcomas reported in any family described to date. Two familial atypical multiple-mole melanoma syndrome kindreds with the CDKN2A mutation showed the association of sarcoma with malignant melanoma, whereas one family had several pancreatic carcinomas. Other families with sarcoma had hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma with MSH2 mutation, hereditary breast carcinoma with BRCA1 mutation, and p53 mutation in a Li-Fraumeni syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcoma-prone families reported in the current study were selected carefully to depict clinicopathology and compliance features, the understanding of which could elucidate the etiologic role of genetic factors in concert with the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity encountered in such families. The lack of a population-based data set for these families posed a limitation",

  "Title": "Identification of novel TP53 mutations in familial and sporadic cancer cases of German and Swiss origin",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare cancer syndrome caused by mutations in the TP53 gene. A number of tumor-associated germline mutations have been described in individuals from various ethnic origins although, thus far, none in affected individuals of German descent. Our work aimed to detect germline mutations in the TP53 gene in five index cases of German and Swiss origin with cancers typical of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. We analyzed all ten coding exons of the TP53 gene by direct sequencing of PCR products. We identified five mutations of which three were found in families with a strong history of LFS in several generations while two likely came about de novo. The five mutations include two missense mutations in exon 4 (Gly105Cys) and exon 7 (Arg248Gln), one deletion of 11 base pairs encompassing the splice acceptor sequence of exon 6 (IVS5-11_-1 del), one nonsense mutation in exon 6 (Arg196Stop), and one duplication of 4 base pairs in exon 8 (1020_1023dupCTGC). The functional consequence of the IVS5-11_-1del mutation on splicing of pre-mRNA was investigated by an in vitro assay. Our study reports the first germline mutations in patients of German and Swiss origin with LFS-related tumors. The frequent identification of de novo germline mutations emphasizes the importance of mutational analyses of the TP53 gene particularly in young patients with malignancies typical for LFS, but without a positive family history of this tumor syndrome",

  "Title": "Second malignant neoplasms in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the chest wall with germline p53 mutation as a second malignant neoplasm",
  "Abstract": "About 80% of children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) will be long-term survivors. Second malignant neoplasm (SMNs) are a devastating sequelae observed on these children, with an estimated cumulative risk of 2-3.3% fifteen years after diagnosis. Primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone (PNET) is rarely observed as a SMN following treatment of childhood ALL. The authors described the occurrence of a chest wall PNET of the bone at the site of a central line placement associated with both germ-line and tumor cell p53 mutation in a 8-year-old boy 1 year after completing therapy for standard risk ALL. A review of the literature of 25,051 children treated for ALL discovered 230 SMNs (0.99%), and only one case of PNET of the bone was noted among this group. The occurrence of a SMN in children treated for ALL is a rare event. Such an occurrence, in particular the development of an unusual SMN, should be evaluated for a germline p53 mutation",

  "Title": "Multifocal intrafollicular granulosa cell tumor of the ovary associated with an unusual germline p53 mutation",
  "Abstract": "A 23-year-old woman presented with a 7 cm right multicystic mass in the ovary, which corresponded microscopically to an unusual lesion consisting of a multifocal granulosa cell tumor with intrafollicular (\u0027in situ\u0027) growth involving two-thirds of mature follicles. Stromal invasion was found in only one area where neoplastic follicles coalesced. Granulosa cells had atypical, bizarre TP53 positive nuclei with hyperchromatism, abundant mitoses and numerous hyaline globules. The contralateral ovary was normal. From the age of 10 years, the patient had a complex medical history of multiple tumors, including telangiectatic osteosarcoma, typical and malignant phyllodes tumor, reticulohistiocytoma of skin, carcinomas of the breast and lipo- and leiomyosarcoma. The female genital tract also harbored myometrial leiomyomas and an early endometrial carcinoma. Retrospective histologic study of all mesenchymal neoplasms in this patient showed, the conspicuous presence of similar bizarre TP53 positive cells with hyaline globules in all the mesenchymal neoplasms. In the genetic study, a germline p53 gene mutation was detected in exon 10, codon 336, generating a stop codon in the oligomerization domain of the protein (E336X). A further p53 mutation was found in exon 7 in the granulosa cell tumor. Mutation occurred de novo since there was no history of tumors in any family members, all of whom had a wild-type p53. Although this patient shows a typical tumor phenotype of Li Fraumeni syndrome, the germline mutation corresponded to a highly unusual mutated domain, which is similar to the one found in childhood malignant adrenocortical tumor; also a rare neoplasm that originates in adrenocortical cells; which are closely related, both functionally and embryologically, to granulosa cells",

  "Title": "Prenatal diagnosis in Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The hallmark of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a familial cancer syndrome, is constitutional TP53 mutation. The authors addressed the complex question of predictive prenatal genetic testing for cancer risk associated with inheritance of TP53 mutation. METHODS: A classic LFS family including the proband (a 20-month-old boy with rhabdomyosarcoma), his 36-year-old father with osteosarcoma, and his 40-year-old paternal aunt with bilateral breast cancer were identified as carriers of a TP53 germline mutation, a novel 1 base pair deletion in exon 5. A few years later, the mother became pregnant twice, and the parents requested prenatal diagnosis on each occasion. Genetic counseling, psychological evaluation, and support were provided by a multidisciplinary team including a pediatric oncologist, a geneticist, a psychosocial worker, a prenatal care provider, and an ethical representative. After providing overall information on LFS, including the high risk of developing secondary multiple neoplasms in LFS survivors, the committee approved prenatal diagnosis at the request of the family. RESULTS: In the two pregnancies, the two fetuses were found to be carriers of the same mutation. Nine years from diagnosis of the first tumor, the proband, and a month later his father, developed second tumors, multifocal osteosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Children with primary tumors belonging to LFS should be considered for screening for germline mutations and genetic counseling by a multidisciplinary team. Whether family members are found to be positive or negative as carriers, such measures may provide, by reducing uncertainty, psychological benefit to high-risk families",

  "Title": "Multiple primary cancers in patients with osteosarcoma: influence of anticancer drugs and genetic factors",
  "Abstract": "One hundred thirty-five patients younger than 30 years with osteosarcoma were treated at the Chiba Cancer Center between 1976 and 1999. They included six patients with second cancer after cure of osteosarcoma (group A) and three patients with osteosarcoma as second cancer after cure of childhood cancers (group B). Third cancer occurred in one patient of group A. The clinical features of these nine patients were studied. The diagnoses of second cancer in group A consisted of two acute myelogenous leukemias, two breast carcinomas, one malignant phyllodes tumor of breast, and one ovarian carcinoma. The third cancer was uterine leiomyosarcoma. Second cancer occurred an average of 7.2 years after occurrence of osteosarcoma. The diagnoses of first cancer in group B consisted of one adrenocortical carcinoma, one malignant teratoma of sacrum, and one ovarian carcinoma (yolk sac tumor). Osteosarcoma occurred on average 12.7 years after occurrence of first cancer. Two patients had germ-line p53 gene mutation. Anticancer drugs and genetic factors are presumed to be concerned with occurrence of second cancer. The frequency of multiple primary cancers in patients with osteosarcoma is by no means low. Strict follow-up is thus needed over a long period",

  "Title": "E-Cadherin (CDH1) and p53 rather than SMAD4 and Caspase-10 germline mutations contribute to genetic predisposition in Portuguese gastric cancer patients",
  "Abstract": "Approximately 30% of all hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) families carry CDH1 germline mutations. The other two thirds remain genetically unexplained and are probably caused by alterations in other genes. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)/sequencing, we screened 32 Portuguese families with a history of gastric cancer and 23 patients with early onset gastric cancer for CDH1 germline mutations. In probands negative for CDH1 mutations, we screened genes involved in hereditary cancer syndromes in which gastric cancer may be one of the component tumours, namely p53 (Li-Fraumeni Syndrome) and hMLH1 and hMSH2 (HNPCC). We also screened in these patients for mutations in Caspase-10, a gene inactivated in sporadic gastric cancer, and SMAD4, a gene whose inactivation in mice is associated with signet-ring cell carcinoma of the stomach. One of the families fulfilling the HDGC criteria harboured a CDH1 germline mutation, and one of the families with incomplete criteria harboured a p53 germline mutation. No mutations were identified in hMLH1 and hMSH2, and only sequence variants were found in SMAD4 and Caspase-10. The present work reports for the first time CDH1 germline mutations in Portuguese gastric cancer families, and highlights the need for p53 mutation screening in families lacking CDH1 germline mutations, in a country with one of the highest incidences of gastric cancer in the world. No evidence was found for a role of germline mutations in SMAD4 and Caspase-10 in families lacking CDH1 mutations",

  "Title": "A TP53-truncating germline mutation (E287X) in a family with characteristics of both hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Mutations in CDH1, which encodes E-cadherin, have been associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) in Western populations but have not been shown to play a major role in Asians. Recently, a patient with familial gastric cancer (FGC) was shown to harbor a germline mutation in the TP53 gene, which encodes p53 and has been previously associated with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS). To determine whether mutations in TP53 are associated with FGC in Asians, we screened the entire coding region of TP53 in probands from 23 Korean FGC families. We identified a nonsense (E287X) TP53 germline mutation in a family whose history is compatible with both HDGC and LFS. Two members of this family (SNU-G2) were afflicted with brain tumors, seven with gastric cancers, two with sarcomas, and one with both gastric cancer and a sarcoma. The E287X TP53 mutation segregated with the cancer phenotype in the family members from whom DNA samples were available. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a large family with both HDGC and LFS. Our results suggest that TP53 mutational screening in FGC families should be interpreted with caution because additional TP53 mutation-carrying HDGC families may also show LFS-related phenotypes",

  "Abstract": "Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for more than 80% of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. p53 tumor suppressor gene that controls cellular growth and differentiation is also known to be mutated in more than 50% of human cancers including breast cancer. We have carried out a study on BRCA1 and BRCA2 along with p53 gene mutations in both sporadic as well as familial breast cancer patients from India where breast cancer is fast emerging as a major cancer among premenopausal urban women. We examined 124 untreated primary breast cancer patients comprising 100 sporadic and 24 familial cases including 56 age-matched healthy controls for the presence of BRCA1, BRCA2 and the p53 gene mutations using PCR-SSCP and direct nucleotide sequencing. Certain frequently mutated exons such as 2, 5, 11, 13 and 20 of BRCA1, exons 2, 9, 11 (for 6174delT), 18 and 20 of BRCA2 and 4-9 exons of p53 gene were analyzed in sporadic breast cancer while all 22 coding exons of BRCA1 including its flanking intronic regions along with above mentioned exons of BRCA2 and p53 gene were analyzed in familial breast cancer patients. We identified six patients (25%) with BRCA1 mutation of which three were found to be of novel type one in exon 16 (4956insG) and two in exon 7 (Lys110Thr) (Ser114Pro) out of 24 familial breast cancer patients studied from two different geographic regions/populations of India. Two sisters from a single family (12.5%) out of eight families from Goa with Portuguese colonial origin showed presence of founder Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1 mutation (185delAG) along with (IVS7 561-34T\u003eC; IVS18 5271 + 66G \u003e A). While from New Delhi, four (25%) of 16 breast cancer families showed BRCA1 mutations; a frame shift protein truncating (4956insG), a transition nonsense (Gln1395Stop) and two amino acid substitutions (Lys110Thr) and (Ser114Pro). Only one (4%) p53 mutation (Val97Ile) in its exon 4 along with BRCA1 mutation (4956insG) could be detected. No major sequence variation in BRCA2 gene was observed except for G203A at 5\u0027 UTR of exon 2, a common population polymorphism in two Goan patients who also showed silent nucleotide change for amino acid serine at codon 1436 of BRCA1 gene. None of the 100 sporadic breast cancer patients revealed any protein truncating or deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. Interestingly, three (3%) p53 mutations in its exon 5 were detected in sporadic breast cancer patients. Although three novel BRCA1 mutations including a founder Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1 mutation were recorded in Indian women with familial breast cancer, the overall prevalence of BRCA gene mutations in Indian women with a family history of breast cancer appears to be low",

  "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy which affects women. In 5-10% of all cases, breast cancer presents as a hereditary cancer syndrome. Since 1996, 68 families with suspicion of familial breast cancer have been referred to our department. In 5 of the 68 families (7.4%), the clinical diagnosis was hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome. In 17 families (25%), two or more breast cancer cases were present. Mutation screening of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in these families revealed a BRCA1 mutation (185delAG) in one family. Three families (4.4%) had a diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome and germline mutations in TP53 (Lys292Ile, Pro278Ser and Pro278Thr). Breast cancer occurred in a family with hereditary nonpolyposis colon carcinoma (HNPCC; Lynch syndrome) carrying an MLH1 mutation (IVS17-3G\u003eC). Most of our families (41 families; 60.2%) had only one case with breast cancer or cystic adenoma (or both) and did not need counseling and DNA testing. In summary, in 10 of the 68 families in our series (14.7%), a germline mutation in a breast cancer predisposing gene was detected. Our data show the importance of detailed examination of clinical data, pedigree analyses, and molecular germline diagnostics for the counseling of breast cancer cases",

  "Title": "Inheritance of R337H p53 gene mutation in children with sporadic adrenocortical tumor",
  "Abstract": "Adrenocortical tumors (ACTs) are frequent in Brazil. The mechanisms of adrenal tumorigenesis remain poorly established; the R337H germline mutation in the p53 gene has previously been associated with ACTs in Brazilian children. We investigated the frequency and inheritance of R337H p53 mutation as well as genotype and phenotype correlation in 21 children and 5 adult patients with ACTs. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells and/or tumor tissue for sequencing exon 10 of the p53 gene. Nine sets of parents of patients with p53 mutation were also submitted to mutational analysis. Virilization was the most common clinical sign in children with or without Cushing\u0027s syndrome. Two members of the adult group showed asymptomatic adrenal incidentalomas, two showed virilization, and one presented with Cushing\u0027s syndrome. Sixteen children with ACTs had peripheral blood available, and twelve of them (75%) showed the heterozygous R337H p53 gene mutation. The R337H mutation was found in fifteen samples of the nineteen tumor specimens available (78.9%). Among the nine sets of parents of the patients with R337H mutation, eight showed the same mutation with heterozygosity in one of the parents. None of the parents showed ACTs or any other neoplasia at the time of the study. Only one adult patient with an ACT revealed the same R337H p53 germline mutation. There was no association between the presence of germline or tissue R337H p53 mutation and malignancy at diagnosis. We confirmed the high frequency of R337H p53 mutation in Brazilian children with sporadic ACTs. The R337H p53 mutation was inherited from one of the parents of the patients, and there was no association between the presence of this mutation and tumor malignancy in children. The founder effect of R337H p53 mutation and the role of environmental mutagens contributing to the geographical clustering and high prevalence of ACTs in Brazilian children remain to be established",

  "Abstract": "We report a 3-year-old boy with a malignant triton tumor (MTT) involving the left masticator space with local invasion and regional lymph node metastasis. Family history and detection of a novel germline TP53 mutation confirmed his diagnosis of Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). MTT has not been previously described in association with LFS. This case along with a comprehensive review of the literature, illustrate the importance of both somatic and germline TP53 mutations in the pathogenesis MTT.

  "Title": "The TP53 mutational spectrum and frequency of CHEK2*1100delC in Li-Fraumeni-like kindreds",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a dominantly inherited cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by a wide spectrum of neoplasms occurring at young age. Germline mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene have been identified in approximately 71 of LFS patients and 22 of Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) patients. Mutations within the cell cycle checkpoint gene CHEK2 have also been reported in some patients with LFS, LFL, and phenotypically suggestive of LFS (PS-LFS) not carrying a TP53 mutation. In this study, we show that 7 of the 23 patients with LFS/LFL tested positive for deleterious mutations in p53. Fifteen of the remaining sixteen were not found to carry the CHEK2* 1100delCmutation. These results indicate that CHEK2*1100delC is not a common cause of LFS, LFL, or PS-LFS in North American kindreds not carrying a TP53 mutation. Of note, two patients were found to carry p53* R72P, which is of unknown clinical significance. Lack of segregation of this allele in one of these kindreds provides strong evidence that the R72P allele is not disease-causing. While mutations in p53 account for a proportion of patients with LFS/LFL, future studies are needed to determine if other genes are responsible for LFS/LFL families not carrying germline p53 mutations",

  "Title": "Evaluation of the molecular mechanisms involved in the gain of function of a Li-Fraumeni TP53 mutation",
  "Abstract": "The TP53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequent target for genetic alterations in human cancer. TP53 gene alterations may result in the gain of oncogenic functions such as neoangiogenesis and resistance to therapy. The TP53 germ line mutation c.659A\u003eC (p.Y220S) was identified in stored DNA from related patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) who died after developing clinically aggressive tumors. All of the patients were treated with protocols that included doxorubicin hydrochloride (DX) as a pivotal drug. To define the in vitro mutational phenotype of this germ line mutation, we used murine fibroblasts explanted from wild-type (wt) and p53 knockout (KO) mice from the same littermate. p53Y220S and p53R175H fibroblasts, obtained from p53KO fibroblasts transfected with expression vectors encoding the human Y220S and R175H p53 mutants, respectively, exhibited resistance to DX treatment. Moreover, p53Y220S fibroblasts exhibited angiogenetic properties, and after DX treatment, p53Y220S failed to translocate into the nucleus and showed an increase in its cytosolic levels. DX treatment does not influence p53 distribution within the nuclear and cytosolic compartments in p53R175H fibroblasts. Peroxiredoxin II (Prx II), a protein that is involved in eliminating reactive oxygen species (ROS), showed increased expression intensity in p53Y220S fibroblasts after DX treatment, as observed by two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis. Moreover, Thioredoxin (Trx), a protein that cooperates with Prx II, is overexpressed in p53Y220S mutants under basal conditions. These data suggest a relationship between the presence of the p53Y220S mutation and enhanced levels of Prx II and Trx in mutant fibroblasts. Since one of the mechanisms of the DX antitumor effect has been ascribed to production of ROS, future studies will evaluate the involvement of PrxII and Trx in the chemoresistance of p53Y220S fibroblasts to DX",

Here, a chronic myeloid leukemia-like syndrome case in a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family with del (12) (p12) cytogenetic abnormality was presented. A hereditary p53 mutation (pro309ser) supported the Li-Fraumeni syndrome diagnosis in this family. This syndrome was characterized by the clonal myeloproliferative accumulation in bone marrow and peripheral blood with negative bcr/abl gene rearrangement finding. The etiology of this rare syndrome is still unclear. This is the only chronic myeloid leukemia-like syndrome case reported in a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family. Del (12)(p12) was observed in leukemias except chronic myeloid leukemia-like syndrome. The deletion in chromosome 12p12 with hereditary p53 mutation should have a critical role in chronic myeloid leukemia-like syndrome etiology in our case",

  "Abstract": "We present five families of paediatric patients suffering from choroid plexus carcinoma in which we found germline TP53 mutations. Only one of the families conformed to the criteria of Li-Fraumeni syndrome and only three (including the Li-Fraumeni syndrome family) met the Chompret criteria for germline TP53 mutation testing. In the remaining two families no family history of cancer was identified and/or the parents of the patient were shown not to carry the mutation. Our results give further support to the notion that the occurrence of this rare paediatric tumour, especially in combination with a positive family history of cancer, but possibly also without any family history, may be an indicator of a germline TP53 mutation. The identification of this genetic defect has important consequences for cancer prevention and treatment in affected families",

  "Abstract": "Here we report a case of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with myelofibrosis associated with Bowen\u0027s disease. A female patient had undergone an operation and chemotherapy for ovarian cancer when she was 65 years old, and she developed MDS at the age of 70 years old. PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a Bowen\u0027s disease lesion, and normal skin showed an abnormal peak in TP53 exon5. Direct sequencing revealed that they all had missense mutation in codon 175 (G to A) of arginine switched to histidine, suggesting a germline mutation of TP53. It was speculated that p53 function was lost by TP53 germline mutation with the loss of a wild type allele induced by the chemotherapy against ovarian cancer, leading to the development of MDS. No therapeutic effects of low dose melphalan or cyclosporine A on MDS were observed, however one month of 30 mg/day prednisolone administration induced a hematological response",

  "Title": "Primary orbital liposarcoma in Li-Fraumeni cancer family syndrome: a case report",
  "Abstract": "AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe a case of primary orbital liposarcoma in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: In July 1998 a 20-year-old woman with a histological diagnosis of orbital myxoid liposarcoma underwent surgical treatment in our department. Since the patient\u0027s family pedigree met the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of LFS, molecular analysis was performed, which resulted in a molecular profile consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. RESULTS: The patient underwent orbital exenteration extended to the upper eyelid; surgical reconstructive steps were performed to permit placement of an orbital prosthesis. Two years after primary surgery the patient underwent a quadrantectomy with lymphadenectomy of the right axilla because of the presence of a nodule of 1.5 cm in diameter in the upper-lateral quadrant of the right breast. One year after the last surgery, the patient is disease free. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of an orbital malignancy in a young patient with a family history of cancer should suggest the presence of an underlying genetic disorder like LFS; with molecular analysis we can now determine the genetic disorder and the exact location of the mutation, and also obtain important prognostic data using specific cellular markers. More prognostic information increases the chances of adequate personalized treatment",

  "Title": "Spectrum of mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, and TP53 in families at high risk of breast cancer",
  "Abstract": "CONTEXT: Genetic testing for inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 has become integral to the care of women with a severe family history of breast or ovarian cancer, but an unknown number of patients receive negative (ie, wild-type) results when they actually carry a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Furthermore, other breast cancer genes generally are not evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and types of undetected cancer-predisposing mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, TP53, and PTEN among patients with breast cancer from high-risk families with negative (wild-type) genetic test results for BRCA1 and BRCA2. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between 2002-2005, probands from 300 US families with 4 or more cases of breast or ovarian cancer but with negative (wild-type) commercial genetic test results for BRCA1 and BRCA2 were screened by multiple DNA-based and RNA-based methods to detect genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and germline mutations of all classes in CHEK2, TP53, and PTEN. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Previously undetected germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, TP53, and PTEN that predispose to breast cancer; frequencies of these mutations among families with negative genetic test results. RESULTS: Of the 300 probands, 52 (17%) carried previously undetected mutations, including 35 (12%) with genomic rearrangements of BRCA1 or BRCA2, 14 (5%) with CHEK2 mutations, and 3 (1%) with TP53 mutations. At BRCA1 and BRCA2, 22 different genomic rearrangements were found, of sizes less than 1 kb to greater than 170 kb; of these, 14 were not previously described and all were individually rare. At CHEK2, a novel 5.6-kb genomic deletion was discovered in 2 families of Czechoslovakian ancestry. This deletion was found in 8 of 631 (1.3%) patients with breast cancer and in none of 367 healthy controls in the Czech and Slovak Republics. For all rearrangements, exact genomic breakpoints were determined and diagnostic primers validated. The 3 families with TP53 mutations included cases of childhood sarcoma or brain tumors in addition to multiple cases of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The mutational spectra of BRCA1 and BRCA2 include many high-penetrance, individually rare genomic rearrangements. Among patients with breast cancer and severe family histories of cancer who test negative (wild type) for BRCA1 and BRCA2, approximately 12% can be expected to carry a large genomic deletion or duplication in one of these genes, and approximately 5% can be expected to carry a mutation in CHEK2 or TP53. Effective methods for identifying these mutations should be made available to women at high risk",

  "Title": "Identification of a novel germ line variant hotspot mutant p53-R175L in pediatric adrenal cortical carcinoma",
  "Abstract": "Hotspot mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene result in the disruption of DNA contact points or alter the overall structure of the protein to prevent DNA binding. When inherited, hotspot mutants are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a familial cancer predisposition. One of the most common hotspot mutations occurs at codon 175, resulting in an arginine to histidine substitution. We have identified a novel germ line variant of the 175 mutant (Arg to Leu; R175L) in a pediatric patient who developed adrenal cortical carcinoma. Surprisingly, the family is not tumor prone or associated with LFS. In vitro, the R175L mutant displayed an attenuated tumor suppressor activity in the regulation of transcription, colony formation, and apoptosis when compared with wild-type p53 and the R175H mutant. These findings suggest that p53-R175L retains sufficient activity to suppress LFS, but not adrenal cortical carcinoma. Therefore, not all hotspot mutants are functionally equivalent and the biochemical nature of the mutant may significantly influence clinical outcome. The implications of these results for genetic counseling are discussed",

  "Title": "Prevalence of early onset colorectal cancer in 397 patients with classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND \u0026 AIMS: Hereditary colorectal cancer is associated most commonly with the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes. We investigated the prevalence of early onset colorectal cancer and the frequency of p53 germline mutations in 64 families from a Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) registry. METHODS: Patients with documented colorectal cancer and a diagnosis at or before age 50 were included. P53 analyses were performed through germline mutational analyses using standard molecular techniques. RESULTS: Among the 397 patients and 64 families in the classic LFS registry, a total of 11 patients (2.8%) from 10 different families (15.6%) met criteria for classic LFS and had documented colorectal cancer at less than 50 years of age. The mean age at diagnosis in this group was 33 years and of these patients 4 developed colorectal cancer before age 21 (ages, 9, 11, 15, and 20 y). All families that were tested for p53 mutations (8 of 10) had evidence of germline mutations by sequence analysis; therefore, 12.5% of the total number of families in the registry had colorectal cancer at age less than 50 years and a documented germline p53 mutation. Mutations primarily were missense or nonsense and were located between exons 4-10. CONCLUSIONS: LFS patients with germline p53 mutations may have an increased susceptibility to colorectal cancer and present up to several decades earlier than the general population. LFS should be considered when a young patient presents with colorectal cancer",

  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal-dominant condition characterized by early-onset sarcoma, breast cancer and other specific tumour types. In most LFS kindreds germline TP53 mutations have been identified. In general, TP53 germline mutations are not associated with late-onset common cancers. We encountered a large kindred in which a wide spectrum of tumour types occurred, including melanoma, breast, ovarian, colorectal, stomach and renal cell cancer, without clear-cut early ages at onset of disease. An Arg213Gln TP53 germline mutation was detected in 12 out of 15 affected family members whereas testing for other cancer susceptibility genes in selected patients was negative. In vitro testing indicated that the specific TP53 mutation inactivates the protein transcriptionally. Our findings suggest that this TP53 germline mutation is a causative factor in this family and that specific TP53 germline mutations can be associated with relatively late-onset common cancers",

  "Abstract": "Pathological mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. This study evaluated mutation frequency of these genes in early-onset breast cancer patients, and correlated this with family history and determined relative risks to family members. Patients with breast adenocarcinoma diagnosed 30 years were ascertained between 1980 and 1997. Family history was established and mutation screening of BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 genes was performed. Estimates of penetrance and relative risk were undertaken. DNA was obtained from 100/139 women. 17/36 familial cases had a BRCA1, BRCA2 or TP53 mutation. Of 64 non-familial cases, one BRCA2, two BRCA1 and two TP53 mutations were detected. Penetrance estimates (by age 70) for breast cancer were 84% for BRCA1 mutations and 91% for BRCA2 mutations and for ovarian cancer, 60% and 26%, respectively. Relative risks associated with mutations were consistent with previous studies. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in patients with breast cancer 30 years are predicted strongly by family history. The majority of families with ovarian cancer were due to mutations in BRCA1/2 whereas these mutations only accounted for 30-50% of the excess breast cancers",

  "Title": "Penetrance of adrenocortical tumours associated with the germline TP53 R337H mutation",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: An inherited germline P53 mutation has been identified in cases of childhood adrenocortical carcinoma (ACT), a neoplasm with a high incidence in southern Brazil. The penetrance of ACT in carriers of the point mutation, which encodes an arginine-to-histidine substitution at codon 337 of TP53 (R337H), has not been determined. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetrance of childhood ACT in carriers of the R337H TP53 mutation. METHODS: The family histories of 30 kindreds of 41 southern Brazilian children with ACT were obtained. A PCR based assay was used to detect this P53 mutation in a large number of relatives of children with ACT. In all, 927 individuals were tested for the mutation, 232 from the non-carrier and 695 (including the 40 probands) from the carrier parental lines. RESULTS: 40 children with ACT carried the TP53 R337H mutation; the remaining child with ACT was not tested. There was no evidence of Li-Fraumeni syndrome in any of the kindreds; however, seven met the criteria for Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome. The carrier parental line was identified in each kindred. Of the 695 individuals tested in the carrier parental line, 240 (34.5%) were positive for the mutation, while none of the 232 individuals in the other parental line carried the mutation. The penetrance of ACT was 9.9% (95% confidence interval, 8.7% to 11.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The TP53 R337H mutation dramatically increases predisposition to childhood ACT but not to other cancers, and explains the increased frequency of ACT observed in this geographic region",

  "Abstract": "The Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) is a significant clinical and scientific problem in need of novel effective therapies. Though many genetic and environmental factors have been investigated the basis, cause, and predisposition to BEN are still unclear. In this study, based on the hypothesis that the genetic pathways leading to BEN might be associated with p53 dysfunction, we screened for p53 gene mutations 90 Bulgarian BEN patients using optimized PCR-SSCP-sequencing analysis. Germline p53 single-base changes were found in blood samples in 10% of BEN cases. Three of them caused amino acid substitutions (p.Arg283Cys, p.Gln317His, and p.Lys321Glu); the other six were either synonymous amino acid substitutions (p.Arg213Arg) or intron polymorphisms (T14766C). To the best of our knowledge, these are the first data investigating tumor suppressor gene mutations in patients with BEN. The obtained results are in support of our hypothesis that p53 gene alterations are possibly involved in BEN genetic pathways",

  "Abstract": "A TP53 germline mutation, R337H, has been previously described in children from southern Brazil with adrenocortical tumours but no documented familial history of other cancers. Here, we have screened for TP53 mutation 45 Brazilian unrelated individuals with family histories fulfilling the clinical definitions of Li-Fraumeni (LFS) or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndromes. Mutations were found in 13 patients (28.9%), including six (46.1%) R337H mutations, and four novel germline mutations (V173M, V197M, G244D and IVS6+1G\u003eT). Families with the R337H mutation presented a wide spectrum of tumours, including breast cancers (30.4%), brain cancers (10.7%), soft tissue sarcomas (10.7%) and adrenocortical carcinomas (8.9%). Testing of 53 Brazilian subjects with no cancer history showed that R337H was not a common polymorphism in that population. Moreover, loss of heterozygocity with retention of the R337H allele was observed in a breast adenocarcinoma, supporting a role for this mutation in breast tumorigenesis. These results show that the TP53 R337H germline mutation predisposes to a larger spectrum of tumours, similar to the one reported for other TP53 mutations",

  "Title": "Younger age of cancer initiation is associated with shorter telomere length in Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a cancer predisposition syndrome frequently associated with germ line TP53 mutations. Unpredictable and disparate age of cancer onset is a major challenge in the management of LFS. Genetic modifiers, including the MDM2-SNP309 polymorphism, and genetic anticipation have been suggested as plausible explanations for young age of tumor onset, but the molecular mechanisms for these observations are unknown. We speculated that telomere attrition will increase genomic instability and cause earlier tumor onset in successive generations. We analyzed mean telomere length and MDM2-SNP309 polymorphism status in individuals from multiple LFS families and controls. A total of 45 peripheral blood lymphocyte samples were analyzed from 9 LFS families and 15 controls. High rate of MDM2-SNP309 was found in TP53 carriers (P \u003d 0.0003). In children, telomere length was shorter in carriers affected with cancer than in nonaffected carriers and wild-type controls (P \u003c 0.0001). The same pattern was seen in adults (P \u003d 0.002). Within each family, telomere length was shorter in children with cancer than in their nonaffected siblings and their noncarrier parents. Telomere attrition between children and adults was faster in carriers than in controls. Our results support the role of MDM2-SNP309 as a genetic modifier in LFS. The novel finding of accelerated telomere attrition in LFS suggests that telomere length could explain earlier age of onset in successive generations of the same family with identical TP53/MDM2-SNP309 genotypes. Furthermore, telomere shortening could predict genetic anticipation observed in LFS and may serve as the first rational biological marker for clinical monitoring of these patients",

  "Title": "Tumor genomic profiling and TP53 germline mutation analysis of first-degree relative familial gliomas",
  "Abstract": "About 5% of gliomas occur in a familial context, which suggests a genetic origin, but the predisposing molecular factors remain unknown in most cases. A series of nine familial gliomas were characterized with 1-megabase resolution BAC array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) together with germline sequence analysis of TP53. This series was compared with a literature series of familial gliomas and a personal series of sporadic gliomas, analyzed by chromosome CGH and aCGH, respectively. No significant difference was noted between the three populations in terms of clinical characteristics, pathologic features, and the most frequent chromosomal alterations, including loss of 1p, 10p, 10q, 13q, and 19q, and gain of 7p, 7q, 16p, 18q, 19p, 19q, 20p, and 22q. However, a genomic region located in 6q was more frequently gained in our series of familial as compared to sporadic gliomas (P\u003d0.028). A germline TP53 mutation was observed in 1/9 cases, which suggests Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Interestingly, the Pro allele in the codon 72 of TP53 was observed in 5/9 tumors. Although familial and sporadic gliomas share very similar cytogenetic quantitative patterns, aCGH is a promising technique for the detection of small genomic differences of potential significance",

  "Title": "BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, and CDKN2A germline mutations in patients with breast cancer and cutaneous melanoma",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: From epidemiological studies it appears that breast cancer (BC) and cutaneous melanoma (CMM) in the same individual occur at a higher frequency than expected by chance. Genetic factors common to both cancers can be suspected. Our goal was to estimate the involvement of \u0027high risk\u0027 genes in patients presenting these two neoplasia, selected irrespectively from family history and age at diagnosis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eighty two patients with BC and CMM were screened for BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, CDKN2A and CDK4 (exon 2) germline mutations. RESULTS: Deleterious mutations were identified in 6 patients: two carriers of a BRCA1 germline mutation, two carriers of TP53 germline mutations (one of which also harbored a BRCA2 deleterious mutation, the other one a BRCA2 unclassified variant), and two carriers of a CDKN2A germline mutation. In addition, 6 variants of unknown signification were identified in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Regarding family history, 3/13 (23%) patients with a positive family history of BC or CMM were carriers of a germline mutation, whereas only 3/69 (4%) patients without family history were carriers of a germline mutation. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that few patients with BC and CMM who lacked family histories of these cancers are carriers of deleterious germline mutations in four of the five genes we examined. We describe for the first time, two simultaneous BRCA2 and TP53 mutations, suggesting that analysis in more than one gene could be performed if a patient\u0027s personal or familial history does not match a single syndrome",

  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by a combination of tumors including sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, adrenocortical carcinoma and leukemia. Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are associated with LFS. We present a family with LFS in which initially a novel germline TP53 intron 5 splice site mutation was found. A second germline TP53 mutation, the exon 7 Asn235Ser (704A--\u003eG) mutation, was detected in this family through pre-symptomatic DNA testing. This latter mutation has been reported repeatedly in the literature as a pathogenic mutation involved in LFS. We provide evidence for pathogenicity of the novel intron 5 splice site mutation, whereas this evidence is lacking for the exon 7 Asn235Ser (704A--\u003eG) mutation. Our findings emphasize the importance of performing additional tests in case of germline sequence variants with uncertain functional effects",

  "Title": "p53 therapy in a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that greatly increases the risk of developing multiple types of cancer. The majority of Li-Fraumeni syndrome families contain germ-line mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. We describe treatment of a refractory, progressive Li-Fraumeni syndrome embryonal carcinoma with a p53 therapy (Advexin) targeted to the underlying molecular defect of this syndrome. p53 treatment resulted in complete and durable remission of the injected lesion by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans with improvement of tumor-related symptoms. With respect to molecular markers, the patient\u0027s tumor had abnormal p53 and expressed coxsackie adenovirus receptors with a low HDM2 and bcl-2 profile conducive for adenoviral p53 activity. p53 treatment resulted in the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis documented by p21 and cleaved caspase-3 detection. Increased adenoviral antibody titers after repeated therapy did not inhibit adenoviral p53 activity or result in pathologic sequelae. Relationships between these clinical, radiographic, and molecular markers may prove useful in guiding future application of p53 tumor suppressor therapy",

  "Title": "High prevalence of BRCA1 deletions in BRCAPRO-positive patients with high carrier probability",
  "Abstract": "Mutation screening of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in probands with familial breast/ovarian cancer has been greatly improved by the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay able to evidence gene rearrangements not detectable by standard screening methods. However, no criteria for selection of cases to be submitted to the MLPA test have been reported yet. We used the BRCAPro software for the selection of familial breast/ovarian cancer probands investigated with the MLPA approach after negative BRCA1/2 conventional mutation screening. One hundred and seventy-seven probands were investigated for germline BRCA1/2 mutations after assessment of genetic risk using BRCAPro. Probands were classified as BRCAPro positive (n \u003d 67) when the carrier probability (CP) was \u003e10% and as BRCAPro negative (n \u003d 110), when the CP was \u003c10%. Conventional mutational analyses of the BRCA1/2 genes and, in one case, of p53 identified 22 pathogenetic germline mutations, 12 in BRCA1, 9 in BRCA2 and 1 in p53, in 22/177 (12.4%) probands. All the mutations except one were detected in BRCAPro-positive patients. In the 46 BRCAPro-positive cases that resulted negative by BRCA1/2 mutation, screening analysis of rearrangements within BRCA1/2 by MLPA was carried out. Three patients with a very high CP showed BRCA1 deletions, consisting of deletions of exons 1-2 in two probands and of exon 24 in the third proband. In one case, the exons 1-2 deletion was shown to cosegregate with disease in the family. No BRCA2 rearrangements were detected, but one patient showed the 1100delC of the CHEK2 gene, whose probe is present in the BRCA2 kit. In our series, the highest carrier detection rate of mutation screening plus MLPA analysis (52.3%) was in patients with a BRCAPro CP \u003e50%",

  "Title": "Rapid Development of Post-radiotherapy Sarcoma and Breast Cancer in a Patient with a Novel Germline \u0027De-Novo\u0027TP53 Mutation",
  "Abstract": "AIMS: Germline mutations in the TP53 tumour suppressor gene are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which is characterised by a spectrum of neoplasms occurring in children and young adults that predominantly include early-onset breast cancer, a variety of sarcomas, brain tumours and adrenocortical tumours. The identification of patients carrying TP53 mutations is primarily based on a positive family history of these early-onset characteristic cancer types. The aim of this study is to emphasize the importance of TP53 molecular testing in patients with very early onset breast cancer and no family history of cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A young woman with no family history of cancer presented with bilateral breast cancer at the age of 27 years. Forty months later she developed malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the right clavicle and another primary left breast cancer. Molecular testing of mutations 185delAG, 5382insC in BRCA1 gene and 6174delT in BRCA2 gene was performed using multiplex PCR and separation on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. TP53 molecular analysis was performed by PCR-SSCP analysis of the whole coding region of the TP53. Exon 8 PCR products were sequenced using an ABI dye terminator kit and examined on an ABI 3100 automated sequencer. RESULTS: Molecular testing of peripheral blood DNA did not reveal mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. A novel germline TP53 mutation, c.G841C, p.D281N, was identified. The detected mutation is a missense substitution, c.G841C, resulting in the substitution of the amino acid aspartate to asparagine, p.D281N. Molecular analysis in her parents showed that neither of them carried the mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel \u0027de novo\u0027TP53 mutation and discuss the importance of molecular testing in early-onset breast cancer patients and its effect on the management and outcome of the disease",

  "Title": "Early-onset of sporadic basal-cell carcinoma: germline mutations in the TP53, PTCH, and XPD genes",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common non-melanoma skin cancer in the Western world. The objective of this study was to examine together germline mutations in the TP53, PTCH, and XPD genes as risk factors for developing BCC at a young age. We hypothesized that mutations in these genes significantly increase the risk of early-onset BCC (\u003c or \u003d 35 years). METHODS: The PCR, DNA sequencing and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms methods were utilized to study eight Puerto Rican patients with a confirmed diagnosis of BCC before age 35. RESULTS: A novel germline mutation (T:A transversion) was identified at the exon 4, codon 50 of the TP53 gene of one BCC patient. No other mutations were found at the TP53 or PTCH genes. The presence of the XPD mutant allele is associated with a seven-fold increase in risk (OR \u003d 7.0, p \u003d 0.03) for developing BCC prior to age 35. In addition, the DNA Repair Capacity (DRC) of these BCC patients showed a 47% reduction that was significant in relation to age-matched controls (p \u003d 0.021). However, the XPD mutant allele was not associated with the decrease in DRC observed in BCC participants. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated population presented BCC before age 35, a phenomenon that is so rare as to make very difficult the study of this subpopulation with a larger sample size. The results of this study, suggest that the XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism may have a significant role in the development of early-onset BCC in the Puerto Rican population",

  "Title": "Identification and characterization of a novel germ line p53 mutation in familial gastric cancer in the Japanese population",
  "Abstract": "Germ line mutations of the p53 gene are known to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and a germ line p53 mutation has recently been reported in a small subset of familial gastric cancer (FGC) in Europe and Korea. Although the incidence of gastric cancer is very high in Japan and familial clustering is not uncommon, there has been little information on the genetic factors of FGC. Therefore, to determine the role of germ line p53 mutations in FGC in the Japanese population in this study, we used sequencing analysis to examine 80 individuals from 35 Japanese FGC families without germ line CDH1 mutations for germ line p53 mutations. One missense (c.91G\u003eA: p.Val31Ile) and two intronic germ line mutations were found, and transcriptional activity of the Ile31 mutant on p53-responsive genes was examined to determine the functional effect of the novel p.Val31Ile germ line mutation. A luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcriptional activity of p21 (CDKN1A) and MDM2 promoters but not of the BAX promoter was significantly lower in the Ile31-type p53 than in the wild-type (wt) p53. Next, doxycycline-regulated p53-inducible H1299 cell lines were established by applying a retrovirus-mediated gene transfer system to a p53-null human H1299 cell line. Under similar p53 expression conditions shown by western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, a cell proliferation assay showed that the Ile31-type p53 had significantly lower cell proliferation suppressing activity than wt p53. These results suggest that Ile31-type p53 may be partly involved in FGC because of its low transcriptional activity and low cell proliferation suppressing activity",

  "Title": "Germline mutations of TP53 and BRCA2 genes in breast cancer/sarcoma families",
  "Abstract": "The genetic aetiology of familial aggregations of breast cancer and sarcomas has been elucidated only in part. In this study, 23 unrelated individuals from families with one case of sarcoma and at least one case of breast cancer were screened for mutations in the TP53, BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Families were classified according to their conformity to the criteria defining the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndrome and hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC). Germline TP53 mutations were identified in three instances (13%), including one LFS and two LFL families, while none of the non-LFS/non-LFL families had a TP53 mutation. Three cases (13%), including one with a TP53 mutation, carried BRCA2 mutations. Of these, two were observed in LFL/HBOC families and the other one in a non-LFS/non-LFL/HBOC family, while none of the non-HBOC families tested positive. These findings suggest that the screening of BRCA2, in addition to TP53, may be appropriate for the molecular characterisation of breast cancer/sarcoma families, with practical implications for counselling and clinical management",

  "Title": "Recognition of Li Fraumeni syndrome at diagnosis of a locally advanced extremity rhabdomyosarcoma",
  "Abstract": "A contemporaneous presentation of a second breast cancer in a mother and an extremity rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in her daughter led to the diagnosis of the Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Although the association between LFS and RMS in young patients is well recognised 1 there are no guidelines as to how this knowledge should influence the optimal management of these patients. After reviewing the literature about the natural history of the LFS 2, the incidence of second malignancy (SMN) in RMS survivors 3-6 and the management of extremity RMS 7-9, we are concerned that contemporary RMS treatment, combining non-mutilating surgery with chemoradiotherapy, may be associated with an excessive SMN risk in LFS patients with advanced RMS. We question whether treatment should be individualised and, where possible and acceptable to the family, measures such as amputation should be the considered to attain local control for LFS patients with RMS as this will avoid the need for local radiotherapy without compromising long-term function and quality of life 10",

  "Title": "Telomere length in peripheral blood cells of germline TP53 mutation carriers is shorter than that of normal individuals of corresponding age",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: A decrease in the age at cancer onset and increase in cancer incidence in successive generations in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) families with germline TP53 mutations have been previously described. In the current study a possible relation was analyzed between telomere length and cancer onset in TP53 mutation carriers. METHODS: Telomere length was measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 20 carriers of germline TP53 mutations and in 83 unrelated healthy individuals. According to the age at blood sampling, patients and controls were divided into 2 age groups, children and adults. Telomere length was correlated to TP53 mutation status and telomere shortening in patients to the age at cancer onset. A t-test and linear regression were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, telomere length was significantly shorter both in the child (P \u003d .001) and adult (P \u003d .034) germline T53 mutation carriers. Although a statistically significant correlation between telomere shortening and the age at cancer onset was not observed, there was a trend of shorter telomeres in mutation carriers affected in childhood compared with those affected later in life. Neither cancer therapy nor sex differences were likely to affect the results. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a possible link between the carriership of a germline TP53 mutation, telomere length, predisposition to early-onset cancer, and anticipation in LFS",

  "Title": "A rare tumor and an ethical dilemma in a family with a germline TP53 mutation",
  "Abstract": "We describe a family with a history of cancer suggestive of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). A 27-year-old woman suffered at 17 years of age from phyllodes breast tumor and was shown to carry a germline mutation in the TP53 gene. Two years after testing, she became pregnant and was offered prenatal diagnosis by her gynecologist. The patient expressed her commitment to deliver the baby regardless of its mutation status, but with a strong interest in having the child tested soon after the birth. When she was informed that testing of children is usually postponed until after they reach 18 years of age, she consulted several geneticists, who repeatedly discouraged her from the intent to test the newborn. In the end, the patient decided for prenatal genetic testing only to learn the mutation status of the child. This scenario being unacceptable, she was offered early postnatal testing of the child, and this analysis showed that the newborn boy carried the mutation. Based on this finding, the family was enrolled into a preventive screening program for childhood cancer. The case illustrates ethical problems associated with early predisposition testing in LFS, and the lack of consensus on this issue in the literature",

  "Title": "Detection of R337H, a germline TP53 mutation predisposing to multiple cancers, in asymptomatic women participating in a breast cancer screening program in Southern Brazil",
  "Abstract": "Germline TP53 mutations predispose to a rare familial cancer syndrome, the Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), characterized by the early onset of multiple cancers including childhood adrenocortical carcinomas, sarcomas and brain tumors, and breast and colon cancer in young adults. An identical germline mutation at codon 337 in TP53 (R337H) has been shown to be causally related to an increased risk of multiple cancers in unrelated subjects with familial cancer risk in Southern Brazil. Here we have assessed the prevalence of R337H in 750 healthy women participating in a community-based breast cancer screening program in the area of Porto Alegre. The mutant was detected in two participants (0.3%) who were fourth-degree relatives and reported a familial history of cancer at multiple sites that did not match classical criteria for LFS and its variants. Testing in additional family members detected the mutation in three subjects, one of whom developed breast cancer at the age of 36. These findings indicate that R337H may be a low penetrance mutant which predisposes to multiple cancers and occurs in the population of Southern Brazil at a frequency 10-20 times higher than other TP53 mutants commonly associated with LFS",

  "Abstract": "About 40% of French Canadian breast and/or ovarian cancer families harbor germline BRCA1 or BRCA1 mutations where common mutations account for about 84% of all mutations identified in cancer families. Within a series of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative families, a germline TP53 13398 G\u003eA (Arg213Gln) mutation was identified, which was selected for mutation analysis in this gene because of a family history consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Given the founder effects in this population, the 13398 G\u003eA mutation was screened in series of 52 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative cancer families, and a mutation-positive family was identified. However, pedigree inspection and expansion of mutation-positive families with the same mutation revealed that they were closely related to each other. To further characterize the contribution of TP53 in cancer families, mutation analysis was performed in the remaining BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative cancer families. Thirty sequence variants were identified, the majority of which occur in intronic sequences and are not predicted to affect the functionality of TP53. However, the 14538 G\u003eA (Arg290His) mutation was identified in a family which did not exhibit features consistent with LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndrome. Neither of the TP53 mutations was detected in 381 French Canadian women with breast cancer diagnosed before 50 years of age not selected for family history of cancer. In all, germline TP53 mutations were identified in two of 52 (3.8%) cancer families, suggesting that TP53 is not a major contributor to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative breast and/or ovarian cancer families of French Canadian descent",

  "Title": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome in a Malaysian kindred",
  "Abstract": "We report on a Malaysian kindred with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The proband was an 8-year-old girl who presented with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the trunk at the age of 8 months and developed a brain recurrence at the age of 7 years, which was 5 years after remission. A younger sister later developed adrenocortical carcinoma at the age of 6 months. Their mother and maternal grandmother were diagnosed with breast cancer at the ages of 26 and 38 years, respectively. TP53 mutation detection in this family revealed a duplication of a GGCGTG motif starting at nucleotide 17579 in exon 10, resulting in an in-frame insertion of two amino acids between residues 334 and 336 in the tetramerization domain of the p53 protein. This mutation was found in the proband and her affected sister as well as her mother. In addition, the mutation was detected in two other siblings (a brother aged 3 years and a sister aged 18 months) who have not yet developed any malignancy. Sequencing of TP53 in the father and two other asymptomatic siblings revealed wild-type TP53. To our knowledge, this is a first report of a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family in Southeast Asia",

  "Title": "Association of the germline TP53 R337H mutation with breast cancer in southern Brazil",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The germline TP53-R337H mutation is strongly associated with pediatric adrenocortical tumors (ACT) in southern Brazil; it has low penetrance and limited tissue specificity in most families and therefore is not associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. However, other tumor types, mainly breast cancer, have been observed in carriers of several unrelated kindreds, raising the possibility that the R337H mutation may also contribute to breast tumorigenesis in a genetic background-specific context. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to determine the prevalence of the R337H mutation by sequencing TP53 exon 10 in 123 women with breast cancer and 223 age- and sex-matched control subjects from southern Brazil. Fisher\u0027s test was used to compare the prevalence of the R337H. RESULTS: The R337H mutation was found in three patients but in none of the controls (p \u003d 0.0442). Among the carriers, two had familial history of cancer meeting the Li-Fraumeni-like criteria. Remarkably, tumors in each of these three cases underwent loss of heterozygosity by eliminating the mutant TP53 allele rather than the wild-type allele. Polymorphisms were identified within the TP53 (R72P and Ins16) and MDM2 (SNP309) genes that may further diminish TP53 tumor suppressor activity. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the R337H mutation can significantly increase the risk of breast cancer in carriers, which likely depends on additional cooperating genetic factors. These findings are also important for understanding how low-penetrant mutant TP53 alleles can differentially influence tumor susceptibility",

  "Title": "A Japanese patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome who had nine primary malignancies associated with a germline mutation of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene",
  "Abstract": "We describe a patient who had nine primary malignant tumors and a germline mutation in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene, characteristically found in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). A 15-year-old girl with no family history of cancer was referred to our hospital because of pain and swelling of the right knee. Osteosarcoma was diagnosed. The patient received chemotherapy followed by surgery and had a remission. After the age of 28 years, nine primary malignant tumors developed successively, including right breast cancer, colon cancer, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the abdominal wall, right lung double cancers, bilateral breast cancers, and MFH of the left thigh. This is the second highest number of types of primary malignant tumors to be reported in LFS. All tumors were treated by a multidisciplinary approach, including surgery. Genetic analysis revealed a germline missense mutation in the p53 gene (c.659 A \u003e G), resulting in Y220C, which has been reported in three families with LFS. The patient died of lung metastasis from MFH at the age of 37 years. Despite the multiple tumors, repeated induction of remissions resulted in long survival. Our findings suggest that a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, including surgery, is beneficial in patients with LFS",

  "Title": "Genetic counseling can influence the course of a suspected familial cancer syndrome patient: from a case of Li-Fraumeni like syndrome with a germline mutation in the TP53 gene",
  "Abstract": "We report a 26-yr-old female patient with bilateral breast cancer who was clinically diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL) and subsequently found to have a germline mutation of the TP53 gene. The patient was initially diagnosed with right breast cancer at age 24 yr and then with left breast cancer at age 25 yr. Surgery and radiotherapy were performed accordingly. The patient had a family history of various types of early onset cancers and was referred to a genetic counseling clinic. She was clinically diagnosed with LFL. Genetic analysis of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene was performed with the patient\u0027s consent. Direct sequencing of TP53 gene exons 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11 revealed a ermline missense mutation, resulting in an amino acid change from an arginine to a histidine (g.13203G\u003eA, p.R175H). Considering the family history, individualized cancer surveillance was performed including a gastroscopy and a brain MRI. Even though the patient had not shown any neurological symptoms, a huge mass on the temporal lobe was incidentally found and the patient received surgery and radiotherapy. Although the residual mass required further treatment, the patient decided on supportive care alone and was discharged. We report a case of LFL, with a germline TP53 mutation, which was confirmed by gene sequencing in Korea. This case shows how genetic predisposition screening and counseling in patients, suspected of having a familial cancer syndrome, can influence the course of the patient",

  "Abstract": "In 1990, an 18-month-old Micronesian girl was initially diagnosed with a right adrenocortical carcinoma. More than a decade later (2003), she was diagnosed with metastatic osteosarcoma with the primary in her right proximal fibula. Given this child\u0027s remarkable history of malignancy, she underwent testing for a genetic mutation that is associated with increased cancer formation. One such cancer syndrome is called Li-Fraumeni syndrome where approximately 70% of patients carry a genetic mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Patients with LFS are at risk for developing cancers of the breast, soft tissues, brain, bone, adrenal gland, and blood cells. Mutational analysis of our patient did reveal the presence of a germline mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. She was found to have a base pair change (A--\u003eC) at nucleotide 394 resulting in a lysine to glutamine amino acid change at codon 132 (K132Q), which remarkably has never been described in association with either adrenocortical carcinoma or osteosarcoma",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) has been associated with TP53 germline mutations and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). We describe our finding of a novel germline mutation in the TP53 gene in a family with multiple malignancies and in association with a child presenting with CPC. METHOD: An 8-month-old male presented with seizure-like activity; imaging disclosed a 1.5-cm left ventricular mass confirmed to be CPC intra- and postoperatively. Family history was significant for a half-sister who died of a primary CNS sarcoma and a paternal grandmother negative for BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, and MSH2 mutations with multiple (\u003e6) LFS spectrum malignancies. RESULTS: Familial TP53 testing revealed an A--\u003eT substitution at DNA position 13071, creating a deleterious Asn--\u003eIle substitution at amino acid 131 in exon 5. CONCLUSION: Physicians treating patients with CPC should be attuned to reviewing family history for risk factors suggestive of genetic cancer syndromes such as LFS. These syndromes markedly influence both the patient and family members and may alter postoperative treatment regimens",

  "Abstract": "Paediatric choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC) and adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) are exceedingly rare tumours, each occurring at an annual rate of 0.3 cases per million children or less. Although both tumour types are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), the penetrance of germline TP53 mutations in CPC remains to be established. We report here a young boy without a family history of cancer who presented with CPC and subsequently ACC. Genetic testing revealed a novel de novo germline TP53 mutation (E285V). Neither tumour underwent loss of heterozygosity. Consistent with this observation, functional analyses demonstrated that E285V acts as a dominant negative mutant that is defective in regulating target gene expression, growth suppression and apoptosis. These results further strengthen the association between germline TP53 mutations and childhood CPC, even when occurring in the absence of familial tumour susceptibility",

  "Title": "Molecular basis of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome: an update from the French LFS families",
  "Abstract": "We have performed an extensive analysis of TP53 in 474 French families suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), including 232 families fulfilling the Chompret criteria. We identified a germline alteration of TP53 in 82 families (17%), in 67/232 of the families fulfilling the Chompret criteria (29%) and in 15/242 which did not fulfil these criteria (6%). Most of the alterations corresponded to missense mutations (67%), and we identified in four families genomic deletions removing the entire TP53 locus, the promoter and the non-coding exon 1, or exons 2-10. These results represent a definitive argument demonstrating that LFS results from TP53 haplodeficiency. The mean ages of tumour onset were significantly different between patients harbouring TP53 missense mutations and other types of alterations, missense mutations being associated with a 9 year earlier tumour onset. These results confirm that missense mutations not only inactivate p53 but also have an additional oncogenic effect. Germline alterations of TP53 that lead exclusively to loss of function are therefore associated with a later age of tumour onset and the presence of such mutations should be considered in atypical LFS families with tumours diagnosed after 40 years",

  "Title": "Germline TP53 mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms in children",
  "Abstract": "Mutations in the gene TP53, which codifies the tumor suppressor protein p53, are found in about 50% of tumors. These mutations can occur not only at somatic level, but also in germline. Pediatric cancer patients, mostly with additional family history of malignancy, should be considered as potential TP53 germline mutation carriers. Germline TP53 mutations and polymorphisms have been widely studied to determine their relation with different tumors\u0027 pathogenesis. Our aim was to analyze the occurrence frequency of germline TP53 mutations and polymorphisms and to relate these to tumor development in a pediatric series. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 26 children with solid tumors [PST] and 21 pediatric healthy donors [HD] were analyzed for germline mutations and polymorphisms in TP53 gene spanning from exon 5 to 8 including introns 5 and 7. These PCR amplified fragments were sequenced to determine variations. A heterozygous mutation at codon 245 was found in 1/26 PST and 0/21 HD. Comparative polymorphisms distribution, at position 14181 and 14201(intron 7), between HD and PST revealed a trend of association (p\u003d 0.07) with cancer risk. HD group disclosed a similar polymorphism distribution as published data for Caucasian and Central/South American populations. This is the first study about TP53 variant frequency and distribution in healthy individuals and cancer patients in Argentina",

  "Abstract": "Germline mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been identified in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and patients with Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL). However, to date, germline p53 mutations in patients not fulfilling the criteria of LFS or LFL have been reported only very rarely. In our study, a novel germline c.584T\u003eC (p.Ile195Thr) mutation of the p53 gene was found in a 21-year-old male with a glioblastoma and colon cancer. He had no family history of cancer within second-degree relatives, and loss of the wild-type p53 allele and overexpression of p53 protein were observed in both tumors. Functional analyses revealed transactivation and growth suppressive function activities of the Thr195-type p53 to be impaired. These results suggest germline p53 mutations to possibly be responsible for a subset of young adult patient with multiple malignant tumors, even those not meeting the clinical criteria for LFS or LFL",

  "Abstract": "Germline TP53 mutations are found in only 70% of families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), and with an even lower frequency in families suggestive of LFS but not meeting clinical criteria of the syndrome. Despite intense efforts, to date, no other genes have been associated with the disorder in a significant number of TP53 mutation-negative families. A search for defects in TP53 other than heterozygous missense mutations showed that neither intron variants nor sequence variants in the TP53 promoter are frequent in LFS, and multiexon deletions have been found to be responsible for LFS only in several cases. Another cancer predisposition syndrome, hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, has been associated with epigenetic silencing of one allele of the MLH1 or MSH2 genes. This prompted us to test the methylation of the TP53 gene promoter in a set of 14 families suggestive of LFS using bisulphite sequencing of three DNA fragments from the 5\u0027 region of the gene. We found no detectable methylation at any of the CG dinucleotides tested. Thus, epigenetic silencing of the TP53 promoter is not a frequent cause of the disorder in families suggestive of LFS but with no germline mutations in the coding part of the gene",

  "Abstract": "The Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare, autosomal dominant disease caused by TP53 germline mutations. This study aimed to characterize the TP53 mutational spectrum in patients suspected to have LFS in Portugal and to evaluate the influence of the MDM2-SNP309 and TP53-72Arg variants and of telomere length on age of tumor onset. Probands were primarily selected using the classical LFS criteria (two cases) or the more sensitive Chompret Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) criteria (13 cases), but 12 additional patients that did not comply with those LFS or LFL criteria were included in the analysis based on clinical suspicion (LFS suspects). Nine of the 27 probands (33.3%) presented germline TP53 mutations, two of them occurring de novo and two of them being novel. Three of the nine TP53 mutations were found in families that did not comply with any of the commonly used criteria for TP53 testing, leaving room to recommend the use of less stringent criteria. An association was found between the presence of the TP53-72Arg (but not the MDM2-SNP309) variant and earlier age of onset in TP53 carriers. A negative correlation between telomere length and age of cancer onset was found in patients with germline TP53 mutation, whereas no such correlation was found in controls or in patients with wild-type TP53",

Breast cancers in women from families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome often occur before age 30. The prevalence of deleterious TP53 mutations in unselected women with early-onset breast cancer is not precisely known. If mutations were found to be sufficiently common, it might be prudent to offer genetic testing to affected women in this age group. We screened the entire TP53 gene in the germ-line DNA from 95 women of various ethnic groups who were diagnosed with breast cancer before age 30, and who had previously been found to be negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. No TP53 mutation was found.

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Germ-line mutations of the TP53 gene are known to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, an autosomal, dominantly inherited, high-penetrance cancer-predisposition syndrome characterized by the occurrence of a variety of cancers, mainly soft tissue sarcomas, adrenocortical carcinoma, leukemia, breast cancer, and brain tumors. METHODS: Mutation analysis was based on Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) screening of exons 2-11 of the TP53 gene, sequencing, and cloning of DNA obtained from peripheral blood lymphocytes. RESULTS: We report herein on Li Fraumeni syndrome in a family whose members are carriers of a novel TP53 gene mutation at exon 4. The mutation comprises an insertion/duplication of seven nucleotides affecting codon 110 and generating a new nucleotide sequence and a premature stop codon at position 150. With this mutation, the p53 protein that should be translated lacks the majority of the DNA binding domain. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this specific alteration has not been reported previously, but we believe it is the cause of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome in this family",

The novel somatic mutation, R337G (16900C\u003eG), was discovered in myelodysplastic syndrome with transformation to acute myeloblastic leukemia, developing as the third primary in the LFS child. These findings add further information on p53 TD mutations and TD contribution to tumorigenesis",

  "Title": "Beyond Li Fraumeni Syndrome: clinical characteristics of families with p53 germline mutations",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: A clinical testing cohort was used to gain a broader understanding of the spectrum of tumors associated with germline p53 mutations to aid clinicians in identifying high-risk families. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Full sequencing of the coding exons (2 to 11) and associated splice junctions of the p53 gene was performed on 525 consecutive patients whose blood samples were submitted for diagnostic testing. Clinical features of p53 germline carriers in this cohort were characterized, clinical referral schemes based on reported p53-associated family phenotypes were evaluated, and practical mutation prevalence tables were generated. RESULTS: Mutations were identified in 91 (17%) of 525 patients submitted for testing. All families with a p53 mutation had at least one family member with a sarcoma, breast, brain, or adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). Every individual with a choroid plexus tumor (eight of eight) and 14 of 21 individuals with a childhood ACC had a mutation regardless of family history. Based on reported personal and family history, 95% of patients (71 of 75) with a mutation met either classic Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or Chompret criteria. A simplified prevalence table provides a concise summary of individual and family characteristics associated with p53 mutations. CONCLUSION: This is, to our knowledge, the largest single report of diagnostic testing for germline p53 mutations, yielding practical mutation prevalence tables and suggesting clinical utility of classic LFS and Chompret criteria for identifying a subset of cancer-prone families with p53 germline mutations, with important implications for diagnosis and management",

  "Title": "High frequency of de novo mutations in Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germline mutations in the TP53 gene. The frequency of germline de novo TP53 mutations is largely unknown; few unequivocal de novo mutations have been reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 341 patients with early onset cancer sent for clinical testing to a national reference laboratory, 75 patients had TP53 germline mutations. Five (7%) de novo mutations were identified, as well as an additional 10 TP53 germline mutations likely to be de novo by family history. The frequency of de novo TP53 mutations in this patient sample is at least 7% and may be as high as 20%. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility that de novo germline TP53 mutations are relatively common has implications for testing and the identification of potential Li-Fraumeni syndrome in patients with little or no family history of cancer",

  "Title": "TP53PIN3 and MDM2 SNP309 polymorphisms as genetic modifiers in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome: impact on age at first diagnosis",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-like syndromes (LFS/LFL), characterized by the development of multiple early-onset cancers with heterogeneous tumour patterns, are associated with germline TP53 mutations. Polymorphisms in the TP53 pathway (TP53 PEX4 at codon 72, rs1042522; MDM2 SNP309, rs2279744) have modifier effects on germline TP53 mutations that may account for the individual and familial diversity of tumour patterns. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four TP53 polymorphisms were analyzed in a series of 135 Brazilian LFS/LFL cancer patients (32 TP53 mutation carriers and 103 wild-type subjects). We report for the first time that another polymorphism in the TP53 gene, TP53 PIN3 (rs17878362), has a strong modifier effect on germline TP53 mutations. This polymorphism, which consists in a 16 bp duplication in intron 3 (A1, non-duplicated allele; A2, duplicated allele) is associated with a difference of 19.0 years in the mean age at the first diagnosis in TP53 mutation carriers (n\u003d25, A1A1: 28.0 years; n\u003d7, A1A2: 47.0 years; p\u003d0.01). In addition, cancer occurrence before age of 35 years is exclusively observed in A1A1 homozygotes. In this series, the effect of TP53 PEX4 and MDM2 SNP309 on age at diagnosis was similar to the one reported in other series and was smaller than the one of TP53 PIN3 (TP53 PIN3: difference of 19.0 years; TP53 PEX4: 8.3 years; MDM2 SNP309: 12.5 years). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that TP53 PIN3 is another polymorphism in the TP53 pathway that may have a modifier effect on germline TP53 mutations and may contribute to the phenotypic diversity of germline TP53 mutations associated with LFS/LFL patients",

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Li-Fraumeni syndrome greatly increases the risk of developing several types of cancer and is usually caused by TP53 germline mutations. Predictive testing of at-risk family members is only offered after a complex genetic counselling process. Recently the clinical implementation of array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) has revolutionised the diagnosis of patients with syndromic or non-syndromic mental retardation and has evolved to a routinely performed high resolution whole genome scan. METHODS AND RESULTS: When using array CGH to identify the cause for mental retardation in a 7-year-old child we found a submicroscopic de novo deletion of chromosome 17p13.1, which includes several genes likely to be causative for her phenotype, and also of TP53. CONCLUSION: Thus, array CGH resulted in an unintended predictive diagnosis of an increased tumour susceptibility as observed in Li-Fraumeni syndrome",

  "Title": "Novel oncogene amplifications in tumors from a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) represents an inherited tumor syndrome that is typically caused by germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene TP53. TP53 dysfunction secondarily disturbs the genetic integrity of the cell. Here, we report a family with LFS harboring a germline TP53 mutation (R248W) located in the functional domain of the protein that binds to the minor groove of the DNA. In this family, tumors of the central nervous system were diagnosed as primary malignancies in all carriers of the mutation. The index patient developed an anaplastic medulloblastoma with unusual genomic profile exhibiting six distinct high-level genomic amplifications, two of them targeting the MYCN and GLI2 genes, respectively. In an extrarenal rhabdoid tumor from the same patient, we found a novel high-level amplification of the MYC oncogene. The father of this patient was diagnosed with myxopapillary ependymoma (WHO degrees I), whereas a brother died from an early relapse of a choroid plexus carcinoma. The analysis of this LFS familiy thus revealed novel oncogene amplifications as different second hits that are likely to also play a role in the pathogenesis of their sporadic counterparts",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To detect the germline TP53 gene mutation in a child with pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma (ADCC) in order to provide genetic diagnosis and counseling. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood from a girl with ADCC and her parents. All TP53 exons and their flanking intronic sequences were PCR-amplified and subjected to automatic DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Direct sequencing of PCR products revealed a heterozygous G insertion between nucleotide 522 and 523 (c.522-523insG) in TP53 exon 5. This novel mutation is predicted to result in a frame shift at codon 175, producing a new reading frame ending in a stop at position 6 (p.R175AfsX6). The same heterozygous mutation was also found in her father, but not in her mother. CONCLUSION: A novel germline mutation in the TP53 gene has been identified in one case with pediatric ADCC",

  "Abstract": "Germ line mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, p53, are known to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL). We sought to identify p53 germ line mutations in potential hereditary breast cancer patients without LFS/LFL phenotype, which will help us establish the genetic testing strategy for p53 in Chinese high-risk breast cancer families. We screened all coding exons and intron-exon boundaries of p53 in 240 women with early-onset breast cancer or affected relatives from four breast disease clinical centers in China by utilizing PCR-DHPLC and DNA sequencing analysis. Additionally, three cell lines (H1299, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231) were transfected with pEGFP-N1-only or pEGFP-N1 vectors expressing either wild-type or two novel identified mutant p53. And then we performed flow cytometry analysis in the transfected cells to determine the status of cell apoptosis, and real-time PCR as well as western blot analysis to ascertain the expression of p53, p21, and p27. Two novel germ line mutations (563T \u003e C and 643_660del18) were detected in two independent families. Neither of them, however, was present in the 768 normal controls. Functional assays revealed that the ability to trigger cell apoptosis and transcriptional activation of target gene under similar expression of p53 were lower in two mutants versus wild-type p53. Deleterious mutations of p53 seemed to be responsible for ~1% of non-BRCA1/BRCA2 hereditary breast cancer in Chinese population, and our findings suggested that p53 should be included in genetic testing of Chinese non-LFS/non-LFL high-risk breast cancer families",

At the age of 38 years, after abdominal pain, radiologic examination reveled pancreatic tumor with bone and lymphatic metastases. The patient died one month later from pulmonary embolism. Sequencing revealed a germiline mutation of this patient that was confirmed in a member of his family in codon 1009C\u003eT, protein Arg337Cys, exon 10 of TP53 gene this mutation was revealed in his nephew (died at the age of 20 from bone sarcoma)",

  "Title": "Population-based estimate of the contribution of TP53 mutations to subgroups of early-onset breast cancer: Australian Breast Cancer Family Study",
  "Abstract": "Although germline TP53 mutations have been identified in women with breast cancer from families meeting Li-Fraumeni criteria, their contribution to breast cancer per se is not well known, but is thought to be minimal. We aimed to determine the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in subgroups of early-onset breast cancer. Germline TP53 mutation status was assessed by DNA sequencing, screening for heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification analyses. From an Australian population-based series of invasive breast cancers, we studied (a) 52 women diagnosed before age 30 years unselected for family history [very early-onset (VEO)] and (b) 42 women diagnosed in their 30s with two or more first- or second-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancer [early-onset family history (EO-FH)]. Of the VEO group, two (4%) had a mutation: G13203A (exon 6 missense) in a 24-year-old and a large 5,338-bp genomic deletion in a 26-year-old. Neither had a family cancer history that met Li-Fraumeni criteria. Of the EO-FH group, three (7%) had a mutation: T13240G (a known intron 5 splicing mutation) in a 36-year-old from a classic Li-Fraumeni family; G12299A (exon 4 missense) in a 33-year-old from a Li-Fraumeni-like family; and 14058delG (exon 7 frame-shift) in a 39-year-old with a family cancer history that did not meet Li-Fraumeni criteria. Germline TP53 mutations play a larger role in early-onset breast cancer than previously thought, and in this context, can be evident outside clinically defined Li-Fraumeni families",

  "Title": "The Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS): a model for the initiation of p53 signatures in the distal Fallopian tube",
  "Abstract": "A candidate early precursor to pelvic serous cancer, the \u0027p53 signature\u0027, is commonly found in the benign mucosa of the distal Fallopian tube and harbours p53 mutations and evidence of DNA damage. We examined tubes from women with pre-existing (germ-line) mutations in p53 [Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)] for evidence of this precursor. Fallopian tubes from two cases of LFS were immunostained for p53, Ki-67 (proliferation) and H2AX (DNA damage response) and analysed for p53 mutations by laser capture microdissection (LCM) and p53 genomic sequencing (exons 2-11). A common single nucleotide repeat (snp) in exon 3 (rs1042522) and deletion sequencing chromatograms in exon 4 were examined in combination to estimate LOH in both LFS tubes and advanced serous carcinomas from the general population. LFS tubal epithelium contained abundant (10-20 per section) p53 signatures with evidence of DNA damage and low proliferative activity. Six of 11 LFS microdissected p53 signatures (55%) and 15 of 21 serous carcinomas (71%) revealed LOH at the p53 locus, relative to background epithelium. The LFS model confirms prior observations that the distal Fallopian tube is particularly prone to focal epithelial p53 gene inactivation-p53 mutation and LOH-in the absence of malignancy or increased epithelial proliferation. The fact that the LFS is not associated with ovarian cancers is consistent with the concept that loss of p53 function must be accompanied by at least one more genotoxic event (including BRCA1/2 functional inactivation) to produce the malignant phenotype. This is in keeping with a general model of carcinogenesis, in which different and often independent risk factors operate at multiple points in the serous carcinogenic spectrum",

  "Title": "Inherited germline TP53 mutation encodes a protein with an aberrant C-terminal motif in a case of pediatric adrenocortical tumor",
  "Abstract": "Childhood adrenocortical tumor (ACT), a very rare malignancy, has an annual worldwide incidence of about 0.3 per million children younger than 15 years. The association between inherited germline mutations of the TP53 gene and an increased predisposition to ACT was described in the context of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. In fact, about two-thirds of children with ACT have a TP53 mutation. However, less than 10% of pediatric ACT cases occur in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, suggesting that inherited low-penetrance TP53 mutations play an important role in pediatric adrenal cortex tumorigenesis. We identified a novel inherited germline TP53 mutation affecting the acceptor splice site at intron 10 in a child with an ACT and no family history of cancer. The lack of family history of cancer and previous information about the carcinogenic potential of the mutation led us to further characterize it. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the non-natural and highly hydrophobic C-terminal segment of the frame-shifted mutant p53 protein may disrupt its tumor suppressor function by causing misfolding and aggregation. Our findings highlight the clinical and genetic counseling dilemmas that arise when an inherited TP53 mutation is found in a child with ACT without relatives with Li-Fraumeni-component tumors",

  "Title": "Radio-induced malignancies after breast cancer postoperative radiotherapy in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are no specific recommendations for the management of breast cancer patients with germ-line p53 mutations, an exceptional genetic condition, particularly regarding postoperative radiotherapy. Preclinical data suggested that p53 mutations conferred enhanced radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo and the few clinical observations showed that Li-Fraumeni families were at a higher risk of secondary radio-induced malignancies. METHODS: We reviewed a cohort of patients with germ-line p53 mutations who had been treated for breast cancer as the first tumor event. We assessed their outcome and the incidence of secondary radio-induced malignancies. RESULTS: Among 47 documented Li-Fraumeni families treated from 1997 to 2007 at the Institut Gustave Roussy, 8 patients had been diagnosed with breast cancer as the first tumor event. Three patients had undergone conservative breast surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy and five patients had undergone a mastectomy (3 with postoperative radiotherapy). Thus, 6/8 patients had received postoperative radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 6 years. Median age at the diagnosis of the primary breast cancer was 30 years. The histological characteristics were as follows: intraductal carcinoma in situ (n \u003d 3), invasive ductal carcinoma (n \u003d 4) and a phyllodes tumor (n \u003d 1). Among the 6 patients who had received adjuvant radiotherapy, the following events had occurred: 3 ipsilateral breast recurrences, 3 contralateral breast cancers, 2 radio-induced cancers, and 3 new primaries (1 of which was an in-field thyroid cancer with atypical histology). In contrast, only one event had occurred (a contralateral breast cancer) among patients who had not received radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These observations could argue in favor of bilateral mastectomy and the avoidance of radiotherapy",

  "Abstract": "There is increasing recognition of familial propensity to glioma as a distinct clinical entity beyond a few rare syndromes; however its genetic basis is poorly understood. The role of p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF) and p53 mutations in sporadic glioma provides a strong rationale for investigating germline mutations in these genes as a cause of familial glioma. To survey the familial glioma phenotype and examine the contribution of germline mutation in p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF) and p53 to the disease we have analyzed a series of 101 index familial cases collected through the GLIOGENE Consortium (http://braintumor.epigenetic.org/). There was little evidence for within family correlations for tumour histology, suggesting generic susceptibility to glial tumors. We did not detect any functional mutations in p16(INK4A) or p14(ARF). One index case with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) diagnosed at age 54 and had a family history comprised of a paternal aunt with GBM at age 55, carried the p53 R158H mutation, which is predicted to be functional and has previously been implicated as a cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Our findings provide no evidence that p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF) and p53 mutations contribute significantly to familial glioma",

  "Abstract": "The spectrum of lipomatous tumors differs in the adult and pediatric populations, with liposarcoma being rare in children. Nearly 10% of individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome develop sarcomas in the first 2 decades of life; however, the frequency of sarcoma types and subtypes in this syndrome is unknown. Two atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas (ALT/WDLS) were identified in the pathology files of our institution in young children from \u0027classical\u0027 Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni variant kindreds with a known germline TP53 mutation (Y220C) in one of the families. The patients were 5 and 6 years of age and the ALT/WDLSs were the first expression of the syndrome. The tumors had a high degree of cellular atypia and differed from sporadic ALT/WDLS by strong nuclear immunoreactivity for p53 and absent mdm2 expression. This is the first report of 2 ALT/WDLSs presenting in children before 10 years of age, both in association with Li-Fraumeni syndrome/variant. ALT/WDLS in a young child should raise the possibility of a cancer predisposition syndrome and, in this setting, the p53(+)/mdm2(-) immunophenotype might be characteristic. Recognition of this lesion and its association is important for early diagnosis and subsequent tumor surveillance in the proband and affected family members",

  "Abstract": "Gastric cancer occurs in some familial diseases with inherited cancer predisposition. Genetic factors have been correlated with the hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and other familial gastric cancer conditions as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The present study was aimed at searching for germ line mutations of TP53 gene in familial gastric cancer with cluster for Li-Fraumeni syndrome or Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome. Twenty-three pedigrees with characteristics for Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome were identified. DNA of the proband was sequenced using polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism. Among these 23 cases, no germ line mutation of TP53 was identified, while two single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in four patients. In our area, in which a high rate of familial aggregation was demonstrated, the lack of germ line mutation of TP53 together with the infrequency of mutation of E-cadherin gene seem to limit the role of genetic predisposition in the development of gastric cancer",

  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is one of the familial cancers characterized by different tumors and hereditary TP53 mutations. The adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) association with acute leukemia is unusual in childhood, even in LFS. The authors here present a family with pR337P mutation in TP53 gene who had a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and associated adrenocortical carcinoma as a case 1 and his cousin with brain tumor as a case 2. A hereditary TP53 mutation supported the diagnosis of LFS in this family. The patients had many difficulties in treatment strategies and succumbed to death. The availability of a reliable molecular marker to detect the R337P TP53 mutation allows the rapid identification of carriers in families that have a child with ACC. Once identified, carriers could be screened for early detection of ACC by imaging and endocrine studies and should be given psychological support to prevent anxiety for death. Whether early detection of ACC will reduce the mortality in these patients remains to be determined",

  "Title": "TP53 alterations determine clinical subgroups and survival of patients with choroid plexus tumors",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE Choroid plexus carcinomas are pediatric tumors with poor survival rates and a strong, but poorly understood, association with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Currently, with lack of biologic predictors, most children are treated with aggressive chemoradiation protocols. PATIENTS AND METHODS We established a multi-institutional tissue and clinical database, which enabled the analysis of specific alterations of the TP53 tumor suppressor and its modifiers in choroid plexus tumors (CPTs). We conducted high-resolution copy-number analysis to correlate these genetic parameters with family history and outcome. Results We studied 64 patients with CPTs. All individuals with germline TP53 mutations fulfilled LFS criteria, whereas all patients not meeting these criteria harbored wild-type TP53 (P \u003c .001). TP53 mutations were found in 50% of choroid plexus carcinomas (CPCs). Additionally, two sequence variants known to confer TP53 dysfunction, TP53 codon72 and MDM2 SNP309, coexisted in the majority of TP53 wild-type CPCs (92%) and not in TP53 mutated CPC (P \u003d .04), which suggests a complementary mechanism of TP53 dysfunction in the absence of a TP53 mutation. High-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis revealed extremely high total structural variation (TSV) in TP53-mutated CPC tumor genomes compared with TP53 wild-type tumors and choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs; P \u003d .006 and .004, respectively). Moreover, high TSV was associated with significant risk of progression (P \u003c .001). Five-year survival rates for patients with TP53-immunopositive and -immunonegative CPCs were 0% and 82 (+/- 9%), respectively (P \u003c .001). Furthermore, 14 of 16 patients with TP53 wild-type CPCs are alive without having received radiation therapy. CONCLUSION Patients with CPC who have low tumor TSV and absence of TP53 dysfunction have a favorable prognosis and can be successfully treated without radiation therapy",

  "Title": "Heterozygous TP53stop146/R72P fibroblasts from a Li-Fraumeni syndrome patient with impaired response to DNA damage",
  "Abstract": "The Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome, characterized by a wide spectrum of neoplasms, occurring in children and young adults. The identification of germline TP53 mutations in LFS has given rise to a number of in vitro studies using cultures of cancer cells and non-tumoral fibroblasts presenting germline TP53 mutations. In the present study, we performed a detailed documentation of the pedigree of an LFS family with a comprehensive analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations. We sequenced the TP53 gene and verified that the proband carries a germline nonsense mutation in codon 146 in one allele, the TP53Arg72Pro polymorphism in the second, and other intronic polymorphisms in the TP53 gene. In order to investigate the disruption of the p53 function in a patient presenting this mutation and the TP53Arg72Pro polymorphism who had so far suffered five malignant tumors and a benign meningioma, we tested her fibroblasts in response to DNA damage by evaluating the proliferation rate, apoptosis, and disruption of the TP53 pathway. The proband\u0027s heterozygous fibroblasts were not as efficient as control fibroblasts or those of her mother, who carried only the TP53Arg72Pro polymorphism, in causing cell arrest and cell death after DNA damage, which was correlated with diminished TP21 protein levels",

  "Abstract": "Adrenocortical cancer (ACC) is a rare and aggressive endocrine tumor. The patient presented with a large retroperitoneum tumor and lung metastases. Removal of the adrenocortical tumor with part of the transverse colon and tail of the pancreas, spleen and kidney was successfully performed following chemotherapy. Levels of serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were found to be markedly high before surgery and may be clinically useful markers for monitoring tumor status during management. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the cancer cells were positive for NSE and overexpression of p53. We identified a novel germ line variant of the 177 mutant (Pro to Arg; P177R) of p53 by genomic sequencing. The genetic and biochemical data presented in this case confirm the importance of screening for p53 status in ACC with inherited cancer syndrome",

  "Title": "TP53 germline mutation testing in 180 families suspected of Li-Fraumeni syndrome: mutation detection rate and relative frequency of cancers in different familial phenotypes",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome. Most families fulfilling the classical diagnostic criteria harbour TP53 germline mutations. However, TP53 germline mutations may also occur in less obvious phenotypes. As a result, different criteria are in use to decide which patients qualify for TP53 mutation analysis, including the LFS, Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) and Chompret criteria. We investigated which criteria for TP53 mutation analysis resulted in the highest mutation detection rate and sensitivity in Dutch families. We describe the tumour spectrum in TP53-positive families and calculated tumour type specific relative risks. METHOD A total of 180 Dutch families referred for TP53 mutation analysis were evaluated. Tumour phenotypes were verified by pathology reports or clinical records. RESULTS A TP53 germline mutation was identified in 24 families. When the Chompret criteria were used 22/24 mutations were detected (sensitivity 92%, mutation detection rate 21%). In LFS and LFL families 18/24 mutations were found (sensitivity 75%). The two mutations detected outside the \u0027Chompret group\u0027 were found in a child with rhabdomyosarcoma and a young woman with breast cancer. In the mutation carriers, in addition to the classical LFS tumour types, colon and pancreatic cancer were also found significantly more often than in the general population. CONCLUSION We suggest TP53 mutation testing for all families fulfilling the Chompret criteria. In addition, TP53 mutation testing can be considered in the event of childhood sarcoma and breast cancer before 30 years. In addition to the risk for established LFS tumour types, TP53-positive individuals may also have an elevated risk for pancreatic and colon cancer",

  "Title": "A novel HER2-positive breast cancer phenotype arising from germline TP53 mutations",
  "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Li-Fraumeni Syndrome is caused by a germline TP53 mutation and is associated with a high risk of breast cancer at young ages. Basal (triple negative) breast cancers are now well recognised to be a typical sub-type of breast cancer developing in a large proportion of BRCA1 gene carriers. We considered whether a similar narrow sub-type of breast cancer was found in TP53 gene mutation carriers. OBJECTIVE: A hypothesis generating study to investigate whether there are specific breast tumour characteristics associated with germline TP53 mutations. METHODS: Pathological characteristics in 12 breast cancers arising in nine patients carrying pathogenic TP53 mutations were compared to a reference panel of 231 young onset breast tumours included in the POSH study. RESULTS: Patients carrying a TP53 mutation showed a significantly higher likelihood of developing a breast cancer with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor (HER2) amplification (83%) when compared to the cohort of young onset breast cancer cases (16%); ER and PR status were equivalent between groups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that breast cancer developing on a background of an inherited TP53 mutation is highly likely to present with amplification of HER2",

  "Title": "Association of germline or somatic TP53 missense mutation with oncogene amplification in tumors developed in patients with Li-Fraumeni or Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Germline TP53 mutations are found in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) patients, predisposed to soft tissue sarcoma and other malignancies. The mutations and succeeding genetic events are thought to cause LFS-associated cancer, whose genetic alterations have rarely been investigated. Here, we study two LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFLS) patients whose cancers showed aggressive phenotypes. Patient 1 with LFS and TP53(R273H) developed a rhabdomyosarcoma twice at the ages of 18 months and 21 years. A single-nucleotide polymorphism array-based analysis revealed two amplicons in the second tumor; one at 5q11.2 containing MAP3K1 and the other at 11q22.2 containing BIRC2/3 and YAP1. Increase of kinase signaling of MAP3K1 along with anti-apoptosis function of BIRC2/3 may have facilitated progression of this tumor. Patient 2 with LFLS and wild-typeTP53 suffered from acute myeloid leukemia. The leukemic cells had TP53(I195T) and two amplicons; one at 8q24.1 containing DEPDC6 and the other at 8q24.2 containing TRIB1, MYC, and PVT1. Quantitative PCR confirmed amplification of the genes and FISH revealed co-amplification of DEPDC6 and PVT1 in the same double minutes. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed increased expression levels of TRIB1, but no or little expression of DEPDC6, MYC, and PVT1. The results indicate that TRIB1 may be the target gene in the amplicon in the leukemia cells. Mutant TP53 can be engaged in pathways triggering gene amplification through impairment of DNA double-stranded break repair. The amplified candidate oncogenes identified in this study may have played a part in cancer development and lead to the poor outcome of LFS or LFLS-associated tumors",

  "Title": "Identification of a novel TP53 cancer susceptibility mutation through whole-genome sequencing of a patient with therapy-related AML",
  "Abstract": "CONTEXT: The identification of patients with inherited cancer susceptibility syndromes facilitates early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. However, in many cases of suspected cancer susceptibility, the family history is unclear and genetic testing of common cancer susceptibility genes is unrevealing. OBJECTIVE: To apply whole-genome sequencing to a patient without any significant family history of cancer but with suspected increased cancer susceptibility because of multiple primary tumors to identify rare or novel germline variants in cancer susceptibility genes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANT: Skin (normal) and bone marrow (leukemia) DNA were obtained from a patient with early-onset breast and ovarian cancer (negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations) and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) and analyzed with the following: whole-genome sequencing using paired-end reads, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, RNA expression profiling, and spectral karyotyping. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Structural variants, copy number alterations, single-nucleotide variants, and small insertions and deletions (indels) were detected and validated using the described platforms. RESULTS; Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel, heterozygous 3-kilobase deletion removing exons 7-9 of TP53 in the patient\u0027s normal skin DNA, which was homozygous in the leukemia DNA as a result of uniparental disomy. In addition, a total of 28 validated somatic single-nucleotide variations or indels in coding genes, 8 somatic structural variants, and 12 somatic copy number alterations were detected in the patient\u0027s leukemia genome. CONCLUSION: Whole-genome sequencing can identify novel, cryptic variants in cancer susceptibility genes in addition to providing unbiased information on the spectrum of mutations in a cancer genome",

  "Title": "Comprehensive genetic characterization of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer families from Slovakia",
  "Abstract": "Germline mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes account for the majority of hereditary breast ovarian cancer (HBOC). Identification of causal mutations may have significant impact on clinical management of such families. Despite high mutation detection rate, many HBOC cases remain without identified cause. These cases warrant use of several analysis methods, such as those for large genomic rearrangements and DNA copy number changes, or analysis other genes, shown to be associated with increased HBOC risk. We assessed 585 Slovak HBOC for the presence of mutations in BRCA genes. Sequencing revealed mutations in 100 families, representing 17.1% (88 and 12% of mutations were located in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively). Four of the mutations, c.80+4del4, c.1938_1947del10 and c.1166delG in BRCA1 and c.6589delA in BRCA2 gene have been described only in Slovak population. Using MLPA analysis, we detected two large genomic rearrangements in three families, a deletion of exons 21 and 22, and a rare deletion of a whole BRCA1 gene. Twenty-seven different variants of uncertain clinical effect (four novel) and 14 distinct SNP BRCA1 haplotypes were detected. Their potential effect was considered using the prediction software packages Align-GVGD, Pmut and Polyphen. We observed that the best clinical criterion for the initiation of BRCA1 analysis is the presence of breast cancer at 40 years of age in the association with the presence of ovarian cancer diagnosed around the age of 50. Conversely, the best clinical criterion for starting with BRCA2 analysis is the presence of breast cancer diagnosed in older age (above 50), or the presence of breast cancer in conjunction with carcinomas at different sites e.g., prostate, colorectum, ovary and uterus. Finally we have seen that the analyses of other HBOC risk gene TP53 and specific mutation in CHEK2*c.1100delC in Slovak HBOC families were not efficient since no mutations were found in these genes",

  "Title": "Association of the highly prevalent TP53 R337H mutation with pediatric choroid plexus carcinoma and osteosarcoma in southeast Brazil",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The inherited, low-penetrance arginine-to-histidine substitution at codon 337 (R337H) of the tumor protein 53 gene (TP53) is clustered in southeast Brazil (estimated frequency, 0.3%). Although its tumorigenic effect initially appeared to be tissue-specific, recent evidence suggests its association with a broader range of tumors. Therefore, the authors of this report investigated the spectrum of pediatric malignancies associated with the TP53 R337H mutation at a single referral institution in southeast Brazil. METHODS: Genomic DNA samples from 493 children with malignancies were screened for the R337H mutation. Available tumor samples from carriers were investigated for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and nuclear p53 accumulation. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. RESULTS: Sixty-five of 70 patients (93%) with adrenocortical tumors (ACTs), 9 of 13 patients (69%) with choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC), and 3 of 41 patients (7.3%) with osteosarcoma carried the mutation. The proportion of CPC to choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) was much higher than that reported elsewhere. Osteosarcoma in carriers had a significantly poorer outcome (P \u003d .02). The mutation was not identified in patients who had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n \u003d 187), recurrent ALL (n \u003d 49), acute myeloid leukemia (n \u003d 44), lymphoma (n \u003d 30), non-CPC central nervous system tumors (n \u003d 26), Ewing sarcoma (n \u003d 25), or rhabdomyosarcoma (n \u003d 8). Among the tumors that were available for analysis, LOH with retention of the mutant allele was confirmed in 21 of 21 ACTs, in 2 of 2 CPCs, and in 2 of 3 osteosarcomas that were positive for R337H. CPCs and osteosarcomas that were positive for R337H had marked nuclear accumulation of p53. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings demonstrated compellingly that the TP53 R337H mutation is associated not only with ACT but also with CPC and, to a lesser extent, with osteosarcoma, both of which are core-component tumors of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome",

  "Title": "Joint effects of germ-line TP53 mutation, MDM2 SNP309, and gender on cancer risk in family studies of Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare familial cancer syndrome characterized by early cancer onset, diverse tumor types, and multiple primary tumors. Germ-line TP53 mutations have been identified in most LFS families. A high-frequency single-nucleotide polymorphism, SNP309 (rs2279744), in MDM2 was recently confirmed to be a modifier of cancer risk in several case-series studies: substantially earlier cancer onset was observed in SNP309 G-allele carriers than in wild-type individuals by 7-16 years. However, cancer risk analyses that jointly account for measured hereditary TP53 mutations and MDM2 SNP309 have not been systematically investigated in familial cases. Here, we determined the combined effects of measured TP53 mutations, MDM2 SNP309, and gender and their interactions simultaneously in LFS families. We used the method that is designed for extended pedigrees and structured for age-specific risk models based on Cox proportional hazards regression. We analyzed the cancer incidence in 19 extended pedigrees with germ-line TP53 mutations ascertained through the clinical LFS phenotype. The dataset consisted of 463 individuals with 129 TP53 mutation carriers. Our analyses showed that the TP53 germ-line mutation and its interaction with gender were strongly associated with familial cancer incidence and that the association between MDM2 SNP309 and increased cancer risk was modest. In contrast with several case-series studies, the interaction between MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 mutation was not statistically significant in our LFS family cohort. Our results showed that SNP309 G-alleles were associated with accelerated tumor formation in both carriers and non-carriers of germ-line TP53 mutations",

  "Title": "Increased incidence of choroid plexus carcinoma due to the germline TP53 R337H mutation in southern Brazil",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC) are rare tumors predominantly found in children. Given the high frequency of the germline R337H mutation in the TP53 gene in southern Brazil, we have evaluated the frequency of the R337H mutation in families with CPC in children. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present series included 29 patients that were admitted to the same institution from 1992 to 2010, including 22 children with CPC (0.08-13.6 years of age at diagnosis) and 7 children with papilloma of the choroid plexus (Pp; 0.5-9.8 years of age). Surgical resection was possible in 28 children. Blood and/or tumor DNA was extracted and analyzed using PCR-RFLP and results were confirmed by sequencing 240 bp of the TP53 exon 10. The patients, all parents, and some relatives submitted samples for blood DNA analysis. In addition, we have also examined the presence of the mutation in DNA from paraffin-embedded tumor samples to evaluate loss of heterozygosity. We found 63.3% (14/22) of the CPC patients positive for the germline R337H mutation; CPC samples were either heterozygous (n \u003d 7), lost only the wild-type (n \u003d 4), or only the R337H copy (n \u003d 2). One CPC sample was not available. All Pp cases (7/7, 100%) were negative for R337H. Cure (\u003e5 years survival free of disease) was observed in 18.1% of the CPC cases with the R337H mutation (2/11), 71.4% of the Pp (5/7), and 25% of CPC cases negative for the R337H mutation (2/8). Family history of cancer (with 2 or more cancer cases) was exclusively identified on the parental side segregating the R337H mutation, and 50% (7/14) of them were compatible with Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show for the first time that the R337H TP53 mutation is responsible for 63% of the CPC cases in children, suggesting a higher incidence of CPC in southern Brazil",

  "Title": "Early occurrence of lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer after radiotherapy of a chest wall sarcoma in a patient with a de novo germline mutation in TP53",
  "Abstract": "We report a 26-year-old female patient who was diagnosed within 4 years with chest sarcoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer. While her family history was unremarkable, DNA sequencing of TP53 revealed a germline de novo non-sense mutation in exon 6 p.Arg213X. One year later, she further developed a contralateral ductal carcinoma in situ, and 18 months later a jaw osteosarcoma. This case illustrates the therapeutic pitfalls in the care of a young cancer patient with TP53 de novo germline mutations and the complications related to her first-line therapy. Suggestion is made to use the less stringent Chompret criteria for germline TP53 mutation screening. Our observation underlines the possibly negative effect of radiotherapy in generating second tumors in patients with a TP53 mutation. We also present a review of six previously reported cases, comparing their cancer phenotypes with those generally produced by TP53 mutations",

  "Title": "Biochemical and imaging surveillance in germline TP53 mutation carriers with Li-Fraumeni syndrome: a prospective observational study",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have a high lifetime risk of developing cancer. We assessed the feasibility and potential clinical effect of a comprehensive surveillance protocol in asymptomatic TP53 mutation carriers in families with this syndrome. METHODS: We implemented a clinical surveillance protocol, using frequent biochemical and imaging studies, for asymptomatic TP53 mutation carriers on Jan 1, 2004, and did a prospective observational study of members of eight families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome who either chose to undergo surveillance or chose not to undergo surveillance. The primary outcome measure was detection of new cancers. The secondary outcome measure was overall survival. FINDINGS: As of Nov 1, 2010, 33 TP53 mutation carriers were identified, 18 of whom underwent surveillance. The surveillance protocol detected ten asymptomatic tumours in seven patients, including small, high-grade tumours and low-grade or premalignant tumours. All seven mutation carriers were alive after a median follow-up of 24 months (IQR 22-65 months). 12 high-grade, high-stage tumours developed in 10 individuals in the non-surveillance group, two of whom (20%) were alive at the end of follow-up (p\u003d0.0417 for comparison with survival in the surveillance group). 3-year overall survival was 100% in the surveillance group and 21% (95% CI 4-48%) in the non-surveillance group (p\u003d0.0155). INTERPRETATION: Our findings show the feasibility of a clinical surveillance protocol for the detection of asymptomatic neoplasms in individuals with germline TP53 mutations. This strategy offers a management option for affected individuals, and its benefits lend support to the use of early genetic testing of at-risk individuals and families.

The patient reported herein developed renal cell carcinoma after anaplastic embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, a previously unknown association. The 2nd malignancy developed very soon after the 1st one, prompting concern for inherent cancer predisposition rather than a therapy-induced 2nd malignancy. A variety of features raised suspicion for Tp53 mutation, and indeed a pathogenic germline Tp53 mutation was identified in this child, despite a negative family history for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Consideration of underlying predisposition is advocated in the context of rapid evolution of 2nd childhood malignancy",

  "Abstract": "The authors present the case of an 8.5-year-old boy diagnosed with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the infratemporal fossa at 21 months old. Five years later he developed an osteosarcoma of the tibia, for which he was treated with standard chemotherapy and resection. Soon after completing this treatment, ptosis of the right eye developed. A mass in the cavernous sinus was found, interpreted as an osteogenic metastatsis, although a third primary tumor could not be ruled out. Molecular genetic investigation revealed a de novo germline TP53 mutation, and heralded an aggressive clinical progression of multiple malignancies in a child",

  "Title": "Pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung arising in a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome: report of a case",
  "Abstract": "We herein report the case of a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) who developed lung pleomorphic carcinoma. A 28-year-old female patient with a family history of early-onset malignancies was diagnosed with lung carcinoma and treated by surgical resection. Histological examination revealed a heterogeneous tumor with epithelial and mesenchymal components. The final pathological diagnosis was pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma. In this patient, a constitutional mutation at codon 213 in exon 6 of the p53 gene was identified in the peripheral lymphocytes and the resected tumor, and LFS was suspected. This mutation causes a nonsense mutation (Arg-to-Stop codon) that has been shown to attenuate p53 function. This is the first report of pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma developing in an LFS patient, and may suggest a relationship between germline p53 mutation and carcinogenesis in pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma",

  "Title": "Clinical and molecular aspects of a pediatric metachronous adrenocortical tumor",
  "Abstract": "The occurrence of metachronous adrenocortical carcinoma has rarely been described. We report a case of a child with virilizing adrenocortical metachronous tumors that, despite several metastases, presented long-term survival (15 years). We analyzed in this tumor IGF2, IGF1R and FGFR4 gene expression, and evaluated the presence of p.R337H germline p53 mutation and somatic CTNNB1 mutation. IGF2 gene was over-expressed in both left (Weiss score 5) and right (Weiss 7) adrenocortical tumors. IGF1R expression levels were higher in the right adrenocortical tumor. FGFR4 over-expression was also detected in the right adrenocortical tumor. In addition, this patient harbors the germline p.R337H p53 mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was detected in the tumors. No somatic CTNNB1 mutations were found in both tumors. In conclusion, we demonstrated in this unusual case the over-expression of growth signaling pathways, which are molecular mechanisms previously related to adrenocortical tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the absence of somatic CTNNB1 mutations, which is a molecular marker of poor prognosis in adults, might be related to the long-term survival of this patient",

  "Title": "Clinical impact of TP53 alterations in adrenocortical carcinomas",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: To evaluate the role of somatic TP53 mutations and to correlate somatic and germline mutations with results of immunostaining, a large cohort of ACC patients was analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with ACC who underwent potential curative surgery at the authors\u0027 department were screened for TP53 somatic and germline mutations in exons 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 by DHPLC analysis. Aberrant samples were further analyzed by direct sequencing. Immunostaining was performed on corresponding paraffin sections in all patients. Complete clinical and follow-up data were correlated with the status of TP53. RESULTS: Thirty ACC patients were included. Four of 30 patients showed aberrant DHPLC configuration and direct sequencing confirmed 2 (7%) germline mutations (R337H, R248W), 1 (3%) somatic mutation (R213X), and 1 (3%) noncoding polymorphism (g.17708 A\u003eT). The only patient with a positive family history harbored a TP53 mutation. Tumors of the three patients with mutations showed aberrant p53 expression in more than 10% of cells by immunostaining, compared to only 3 of 27 patients without mutations (p \u003d 0.009). Aberrant p53 expression (\u003e5%) was detected in 12/30 (40%) ACCs. The latter was associated with an increased Ki67 and van Slooten index (p \u003c/\u003d 0.001; p \u003d 0.020). Disease-free survival decreased significantly in patients with aberrant p53 IHC of more than 5% of cells (65.7 +/- 12.4 vs. 26.6 +/- 8.7 months; p \u003d 0.043 log rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ACC revealed aberrant expression of p53 in 40%, and mutations were identified in 25% of these patients. Therefore aberrant p53 expression should be considered an indicator for genetic testing. A subgroup of apparently sporadic ACC is caused by TP53 germline mutations, and family history is a strong indicator for p53 germline mutations",

  "Title": "Early onset HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with germline TP53 mutations",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Germline TP53 mutations predispose to early onset breast cancer in women and are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Published data on the pathological characteristics of breast cancer among women with TP53 mutations is limited. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of women who underwent genetic testing for suspected germline TP53 mutations and who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2011. The pathological characteristics of the breast tumors from patients testing positive for a mutation (cases) were compared with those testing negative (controls). RESULTS: Patients who tested positive for germlineTP53 mutations (n \u003d 30) were compared with controls (n \u003d 79). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification and/or overexpression was found in 67% of the tumors from the cases, compared with 25% for the controls (P \u003d .0001). Among patients with a mutation, 70% had estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive tumors, compared with 68% in the control group (P \u003d .87). After adjusting for age at breast cancer diagnosis, having a HER2-positive tumor increased the odds of testing positive for a germline TP53 mutation (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-18.2). For each yearly increment in age at breast cancer diagnosis, there was decreased likelihood of having a TP53 mutation of 5% (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval0.91-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an association between germline TP53 mutations and early onset HER2-positive breast cancer. If confirmed in a larger cohort, these results could guide genetic testing strategies, lead to chemoprevention trials incorporating HER2-targeted therapies, and elucidate some of the molecular pathways involved in breast cancer",

  "Title": "Genome sequencing of pediatric medulloblastoma links catastrophic DNA rearrangements with TP53 mutations",
  "Abstract": "Genomic rearrangements are thought to occur progressively during tumor development. Recent findings, however, suggest an alternative mechanism, involving massive chromosome rearrangements in a one-step catastrophic event termed chromothripsis. We report the whole-genome sequencing-based analysis of a Sonic-Hedgehog medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) brain tumor from a patient with a germline TP53 mutation (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), uncovering massive, complex chromosome rearrangements. Integrating TP53 status with microarray and deep sequencing-based DNA rearrangement data in additional patients reveals a striking association between TP53 mutation and chromothripsis in SHH-MBs. Analysis of additional tumor entities substantiates a link between TP53 mutation and chromothripsis, and indicates a context-specific role for p53 in catastrophic DNA rearrangements. Among these, we observed a strong association between somatic TP53 mutations and chromothripsis in acute myeloid leukemia. These findings connect p53 status and chromothripsis in specific tumor types, providing a genetic basis for understanding particularly aggressive subtypes of cancer",

  "Title": "TP53 germline mutations in adult patients with adrenocortical carcinoma",
  "Abstract": "CONTEXT: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a cancer predisposition syndrome associated with germline mutations in TP53. According to the Chompret criteria for LFS, any patient with adrenocortical cancer (ACC), irrespective of age and family history, is at high risk for a TP53 germline mutation. However, whereas such mutations have been detected with high frequency in childhood ACC, a large cohort of adult patients with ACC has never been investigated for TP53 germline mutations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of TP53 germline mutations in adult patients with ACC. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 103 adult Caucasian patients with ACC, TP53 germline mutation analysis was performed. In patients with a TP53 germline mutation, tumor tissue was analyzed for loss of heterozygosity of TP53 and p53 immunohistochemistry. Family history and clinical course were also evaluated. RESULTS: In four patients, a total of five TP53 germline mutations were found. Two mutations occurred in exon 10 (R337H and I332M, respectively), outside the hot spot region. Here, three mutations are described for the first time in ACC, and one, which occurred combined with a second mutation (R202C) on the same allele, has never been reported before in the context of LFS. This combined mutation was associated with a remarkable family history of ACC also affecting the mother and uncle of the index patient. In the 23 patients with ACC below the age of 40 yr, 13% (95% confidence interval, 3.7-32.9%) carried a TP53 germline mutation, whereas such mutations were rare in older patients with ACC. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate a need to revise the Chompret criteria. However, in younger adults (\u003c40 yr old) with ACC, screening for TP53 germline mutations may be justified",

  "Title": "De novo childhood myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease with unique molecular characteristics",
  "Abstract": "Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative uclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U) is a rare myeloid neoplasm characterized by myelodysplasia and myeloproliferation at the time of initial presentation, which is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. The molecular pathogenesis of MDS/MPN-U patients remains to be elucidated. Among five patients diagnosed with MDS/MPN-U, three patients harboured RUNX1 (AML1) mutations; one carried somatic mosaicism of RUNX1 mutation with JAK2(V617F) mutation and one had dual RUNX1 and FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutations with progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Germline mutation of TP53 was detected as a sole genetic lesion in one patient. JAK2(V617F) and somatic mosaicism of KRAS and TET2 mutations co-existed in one patient. Otherwise, no alterations were detected in PTPN11, NRAS, CBL and ASXL1 genes. ETV6-PDGFRB fusion transcript was not detected in all patients. Four patients recieved haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); three patients relapsed and one achieved complete remission after three donor lymphocyte infusions. Our findings suggest that the mutational spectrum observed in childhood MDS/MPN-U is quite different from that seen in juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia and, to some extent, resemble chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Moreover, two patients had constitutional alterations of genes frequently found in AML. Further investigations are required to define the roles of these genetic alterations in the pathogenesis of childhood MDS/MPN-U",

  "Abstract": "Choong SS, Latiff ZA, Mohamed M, Lim LLW, Chen KS, Vengidasan L, Razali H, Abdul Rahman EJ, Ariffin H for Malaysian Society of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology. Childhood adrenal cortical carcinoma as a sentinel cancer for detecting families with germline TP53 mutations. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant disorder where affected individuals carry a 50% risk of developing cancer before 30 years of age. It is most commonly associated with mutations in the tumour suppressor gene, TP53. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a very rare paediatric cancer, and up to 80% of affected children are found to carry germline TP53 mutations. Hence, we propose using childhood ACC incidence as selection criteria for referral for TP53 mutation testing, independent of familial cancer history. Under the auspices of the Malaysian Society of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, four eligible children diagnosed with ACC over a 30-month study period were referred for mutation testing. Three had a germline TP53 mutation. Subsequent TP53 testing in relatives showed two inherited mutations and one de novo mutation. These findings strongly support paediatric ACC as a useful sentinel cancer for initiating a germline TP53/LFS detection programme, particularly in countries where the lack of structured oncogenetic practice precludes the identification of families with LFS features",

  "Title": "Prevalence of germline TP53 mutations and history of Li-Fraumeni syndrome in families with childhood adrenocortical tumors, choroid plexus tumors, and rhabdomyosarcoma: A population-based survey",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Whether childhood adrenocortical tumors (ACTs), choroid plexus tumors (CPTs), and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) are early manifestation of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is uncertain. In this study, we evaluated the frequency of germline TP53 mutations and family history in a population-based series of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified children (\u003c/\u003d18 years) diagnosed between 1958 and 2008 with ACT (n \u003d 3) or CPT (n \u003d 7), or children \u003c/\u003d5 years with RMS (n \u003d 29). Registry-based pedigree expansion was performed. RESULTS: No patients had a family history of classic LFS but 17 fulfilled Chompret or Eeles criteria. TP53 mutations were found in 1/3 ACT patients and 1/18 RMS patients; both were novel mutations. Of five tested CPT patients none had a detectable mutation. No excess of LFS associated tumors was observed, except for breast cancer in families of CPT patients. An overall increased cancer incidence was observed in families of patients with CPT [standardized incidence ratio (SIR) \u003d 2.0; 95% CI: 1.1-3.5] due to excess of breast and female kidney cancer and in families of patients with RMS (SIR \u003d 1.2; 95% CI: 0.9-1.7), due to excess of early-onset melanoma and male stomach cancer. CONCLUSION: Relatives of patients with childhood ACTs, CPTs, and RMSs showed no increased risk of LFS associated tumors. However, TP53 mutations could be found in these children irrespective of family history. Absence of LFS associated tumors may suggest the presence of other cancer syndromes. Improved knowledge about relatives\u0027 cancer risks could be helpful in counseling family members of children with cancer. Pediatr Blood Cancer (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",

  "Abstract": "Most p53 mutations identified in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) are missense mutations; splicing mutations have rarely been reported. A novel splicing p53 mutation was identified in a patient with Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL). Usually, p53 missense mutants identified in LFS and cancer cells function as dominant negative mutations interfering with wild-type p53 function. However, the mechanism by which p53 haploinsufficiency causes carcinogenesis is not well characterized. In this study, we describe a novel splicing mutation that results in the loss-of-function of p53. These findings suggest a linkage between the loss-of-function type p53 mutation and a LFL phenotype.

  "Title": "BRCA1, TP53, and CHEK2 germline mutations in uterine serous carcinoma",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is not recognized as part of any defined hereditary cancer syndrome, and its association with hereditary breast and ovarian carcinoma and Lynch syndrome are uncertain. METHODS: Using targeted capture and massively parallel genomic sequencing, 151 subjects with USC were assessed for germline mutations in 30 tumor suppressor genes, including BRCA1 (breast cancer 1, early onset), BRCA2, the DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1 [mutL homolog 1], MSH2 [mutS homolog 2], MSH6, PMS2 [postmeiotic segregation increased 2]), TP53 (tumor protein p53), and 10 other genes in the Fanconi anemia-BRCA pathway. Ten cases with \u003c 10% serous histology were also assessed. RESULTS: Seven subjects (4.6%) carried germline loss-of-function mutations: 3 subjects (2.0%) with mutations in BRCA1, 2 subjects (1.3%) with mutations in TP53, and 2 subjects (1.3%) with mutations in CHEK2 (checkpoint kinase 2). One subject with \u003c 10% serous histology had an MSH6 mutation. Subjects with MSH6 and TP53 mutations had neither personal nor family histories suggestive of Lynch or Li-Fraumeni syndromes. Of the 22 women with USC and a personal history of breast carcinoma, the frequency of BRCA1 mutations was 9%, compared to 0.9% in 119 women with no such history. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 5% of women with USC have germline mutations in 3 different tumor suppressor genes: BRCA1, CHEK2, and TP53. Mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes that cause Lynch syndrome are rare in USC. The germline BRCA1 mutation rate in USC subjects of 2% is higher than expected in a nonfounder population, suggesting that USC is associated with hereditary breast and ovarian carcinoma in a small proportion of cases. Women with USC and breast cancer should be offered genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Cancer 2012. (c) 2012 American Cancer Society",

  "Title": "An identical, complex TP53 mutation arising independently in two unrelated families with diverse cancer profiles: the complexity of interpreting cancer risk in carriers",
  "Abstract": "Most inherited TP53 mutations have been identified in individuals with a family cancer predisposition syndrome, in which the activity of p53 mutants is severely reduced. However, germline p53 mutants in children with \u0027sporadic\u0027 adrenocortical or choroid plexus tumors exhibit a wide range of functional activity. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of a complex germline TP53 mutation in two unrelated families with different cancer phenotypes, neither fulfilling the classic criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The TP53 mutation consists of a duplication of 7 bp in exon 4, resulting in a frame shift and premature stop signal. Haplotype analysis indicated that the mutation arose independently in the two families. Analysis of the DNA secondary structure predicts the TP53 mutation occurred within a hairpin loop. Additional germline complex mutations occurring within the same region of exon 4 have been identified in the IARC database. Our findings suggest that certain TP53 regions are prone to intrinsic genetic alterations, possibly through defects in DNA replication or repair. Further, carriers of the same TP53 mutation can have diverse cancer profiles, illustrating the complexity of genetic counseling and risk prediction",

  "Title": "The R337H mutation in TP53 and breast cancer in Brazil",
  "Abstract": "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in p53 are associated with the Li-Fraumeni Syndrome which is characterized by childhood cancers, including pediatric adrenal cortical carcinomas and early onset breast cancer. The high incidence of adrenal cortical carcinomas in southern Brazil is mostly attributed to the R337H mutation in TP53. The relatively high population frequency of this mutation in southern Brazil, along with the clustering of early onset breast cancer in Li-Frameni families, suggests this mutation may also be a low-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility polymorphism. METHODS: We undertook this study to evaluate the frequency of the R337H mutation in breast cancer patients from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. R337H mutation status was determined in 390 unselected breast cases and 324 controls identified from clinics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil using a PCR-based assay. RESULTS: Two of the breast cancer cases (0.5%) and none of the controls carried the mutation. Both cases had an early age at diagnosis (\u003c 40 years old) and a family history of breast and other cancers. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest genetic screening of young onset breast cancer patients should include testing for the R337H mutation",

  "Title": "Routine TP53 testing for breast cancer under age 30: ready for prime time?",
  "Abstract": "It is well known that early-onset breast cancer may be due to an inherited predisposition. When evaluating women diagnosed with breast cancer under age 30, two important syndromes are typically considered: Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Many women are offered genetic testing for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes; however, few are offered genetic testing for mutations in the TP53 gene. There is a concern that overly restrictive testing of TP53 may fail to recognize families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. We reviewed the genetic test results and family histories of all women with early-onset breast cancer who had genetic testing of the TP53 gene at the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children. Of the 28 women tested, six (33.3 %) had a mutation in the TP53 gene; a mutation was found in 7.7 % of women who did not meet current criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. By reviewing similar data published between 2000 and 2011, we estimate that 5-8 % of women diagnosed with early-onset breast cancer, and who have a negative family history, may have a mutation in the TP53 gene. Given the potential benefits versus harms of this testing, we discuss the option of simultaneous testing of all three genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53) for women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 30",

  "Title": "Late onset Li-Fraumeni syndrome with bilateral breast cancer and other malignancies: case report and review of the literature",
  "Abstract": "ABSTRACT: Li-Fraumeni-Syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal-dominant, inherited tumour predisposition syndrome caused by heterozygous germline mutations in TP53. Patients with LFS are at high risk to develop early-onset breast cancer and multiple malignancies, among which sarcomas are the most common. A high incidence of childhood tumours and an almost 100% penetrance has been described. The knowledge of the genetic status of the TP53-gene in such patients is important not only because of the risk of malignancies but also due to therapeutical implications, since a higher rate of radiation-induced secondary tumours in these patients has been implied. Hereby we report about a LFS patient affected by four synchronous malignancies at the age of 40: a myxofibrosarcoma of the right upper arm, bilateral breast cancer and a periadrenal liposarcoma, in whom we identified a heterozygous pathogenic TP53 germline mutation. Analyses of both parents revealed that the mutation is arisen \u0027de novo\u0027, and this mutation is described in the context of the gene function. Therapy, i.e. radiological treatments and surveillance program were adjusted according to recommendations for LFS patients. Additionally, the literature regarding possible reduced sensibility for cytotoxic treatment and an elevated risk for secondary malignancies in the radiation field was reviewed",

  "Abstract": "ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Germline TP53 mutations cause an increased risk to early-onset breast cancer in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) families and the majority of carriers identified through breast cancer cohorts have LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) features. However, in Asia and in many low resource settings, it is challenging to obtain accurate family history, and we therefore sought to determine whether the presence of early-onset breast cancer is an appropriate selection criteria for germline TP53 testing. METHODS: A total of 100 patients with early-onset breast cancer ([less than or equal to]35 years) treated at University Malaya Medical Centre between 2003 and 2009, were analysed for germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 by full DNA sequencing. Of the mutations identified, we examined their likely pathogenicity on the basis of prevalence in a case-control cohort, co-segregation analyses and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumour tissues. RESULTS: We identified 11 BRCA1 (11%) and 6 BRCA2 (6%) germline carriers amongst early-onset breast cancer patients. Of the 83 BRCA-negative patients, we identified four exonic variants and three intronic variants in TP53. Of these, two exonic variants are clinically relevant (E346X and p. G334_R335dup6) and two novel missense mutations (A138V and E285K) are likely to be clinically relevant, on the basis of co-segregation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Notably, E285K was found in two unrelated individuals and haplotype analyses suggest a founder effect. Two of the three intronic variants are likely benign based on their prevalence in a control population. Clinically relevant TP53 germline mutations were identified in three of the four patients (75%) with a family history of at least two LFS-linked cancers [breast, bone or soft tissue sarcoma, brain tumours or adrenocortical cancer]; 1 of the 17 patients (6%) with a family history of breast cancer only, and 1 of the 62 patients (\u003c2%) with no family history of breast or LFS-linked cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports germline BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 mutations are found in early-onset breast cancer patients at 11%, 6%, 5% respectively, suggesting that TP53 mutation screening should be considered for these patients. However, we find that even in low resource Asian settings where family history is poorly reported, germline TP53 mutations are found predominantly amongst breast cancer patients with family history of LFS-linked cancers",

  "Title": "A prospective biological study in relation to a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder associated with different tumor types in childhood and young adults. Approximately 70% of LFS cases contain germline mutations in the TP53 gene. We report a case of a family suspected of LFS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proband and four members of the family affected were diagnosed with cancer at an early age and they all died except the proband. Exons 5-9 from TP53 gene were analysed by direct amplification and sequencing in 7 family members. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a germline nonsense mutation in exon 8 at codon 306 of the codified region of the TP53 gene, causing a change of CGA to TGA (Arg--\u003eStop) in the proband, her mother, her cousin and her maternal uncle. Proband\u0027s maternal grandmother and aunt do not have the mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The members of this family that were studied meet the criteria of classic LFS and the described mutation increases their susceptibility to develop cancer. The proband\u0027s maternal grandfather died of lung cancer in 1993, and we believe that he was the carrier of the mutation in this family",

  "Title": "Germline mutations in the DNA damage response genes BRCA1, BRCA2, BARD1 and TP53 in patients with therapy related myeloid neoplasms",
  "Abstract": "Background Therapy related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs) are complex diseases originating from an interplay between exogenous toxicities and a susceptible organism. It has been hypothesised that in a subset of cases t-MNs develop in the context of hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes. Methods The study systematically evaluated pedigrees of patients with t-MNs for cancer incidences and the possibility of a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome. In addition, mutational analyses were performed using constitutional DNA from index patients, and deleterious heterozygous germline mutations were assessed for loss of heterozygosity in sorted leukaemic cells by single nucleotide polymorphism array. Results A nuclear pedigree was obtained in 51/53 patients with t-MNs resulting in a total of 828 individuals analysed. With a standardised incidence ratio of 1.03 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.39), the tumour incidence of first- degree relatives was not increased. However, six pedigrees were suggestive for a hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, three of a Li-Fraumeni like syndrome, and three index patients showed multiple primary neoplasms. Mutational analysis revealed two BRCA1 (c.3112G--\u003eT, c.5251C--\u003eT), one BRCA2 (c.4027A--\u003eG), two BARD1 (C557S) and four TP53 germline mutations (g.18508_18761delinsGCC, c.847C--\u003eT, c.845_848dupGGCG, c.1146delA) in nine of 53 (17%) index patients with t-MNs. Loss of heterozygosity in leukaemic cells was demonstrated for the BRCA1c.3112G--\u003eT and TP53c.845_848dupGGCG mutations, respectively. Conclusion It is concluded that a proportion of patients with t-MNs carry cancer susceptibility mutations which are likely to contribute to therapy related leukaemogenesis",

  "Title": "Increased oxidative metabolism in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "There is growing evidence that alterations in metabolism may contribute to tumorigenesis. Here, we report on members of families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome who carry germline mutations in TP53, the gene encoding the tumor-suppressor protein p53. As compared with family members who are not carriers and with healthy volunteers, family members with these mutations have increased oxidative phosphorylation of skeletal muscle. Basic experimental studies of tissue samples from patients with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome and a mouse model of the syndrome support this in vivo finding of increased mitochondrial function. These results suggest that p53 regulates bioenergetic homeostasis in humans.

  "Title": "A TP53 founder mutation, p.R337H, is associated with phyllodes breast tumors in Brazil",
  "Abstract": "A few studies have reported phyllodes tumors (PT) of the breast with germline TP53 mutations. Given this potential association and the high frequency of the TP53 p.R337H in southern and southeastern Brazil, the aim of this study was to assess whether p.R337H occurs among women diagnosed with such rare tumors in this region. Benign, borderline, and malignant breast PT were retrieved from eight pathology laboratories, and DNA was extracted from tumor tissue to perform p.R337H analysis. Overall, 128 cases classified as benign, 7 as borderline, and 13 as malignant PT were included in the study. The TP53 p.R337H mutation was identified in tumor cells of eight (5.4 %) cases. Analysis of DNA from non-tumoral tissue was possible in two of these, and both were p.R337H carriers in the germline. In addition, haplotype analysis was done in these two p.R337H carriers showing the presence of the founder haplotype previously reported in Brazilian mutation-positive individuals. Mutation frequency was significantly higher among malignant (3 of 13; 23 %) compared to benign tumors (5 of 128; 3.4 %) (p \u003d 0.004). Mean age at PT diagnosis was not significantly different between mutation carriers and non-carriers. However, when subgroups where analyzed, the difference in age at diagnosis of carriers versus non-carriers within the group of benign tumors reached borderline significance. Our findings reinforce previous evidence that TP53 mutations have an important role in the development of both benign and malignant PT of the breast",

  "Title": "Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome among children diagnosed with pediatric cancer in Southern Brazil",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pediatric cancers are a feature in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and its variant Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFS/LFL). To the best of the authors\u0027 knowledge, TP53 germline mutations are currently the only molecular defect known to be associated with this disease. Recently, a specific germline mutation in this gene, p.R337H, has been reported at a high prevalence in Brazil. METHODS: The prevalence of LFS/LFL was investigated in children with cancer who were diagnosed with tumors on the LFS/LFL spectrum and in a small consecutive series of controls without cancer. The prevalence of the germline p.R337H mutation and of other germline TP53 mutations was investigated in a general group of children with cancer and exclusively in children fulfilling the clinical criteria for LFS/LFL, respectively. RESULTS: Among the 65 children without cancer, 1.5% had a family history of LFL whereas of the 292 children with cancer, 25.3% had a family history of LFL (P \u003c .001). Screening for the p.R337H mutation identified 11 carriers (3.7%), 9 of whom were diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) and 2 of whom were diagnosed with choroid plexus carcinomas. One of the ACC probands was homozygous mutant. The Brazilian founder haplotype and loss of heterozygosity at the p.R337H locus were present in all carriers. In addition, direct sequencing of the entire TP53 coding region and gene rearrangement analysis of probands fulfilling the criteria for LFL (Eeles 2 criteria, Birch and/or Chompret criteria) and who were negative for the p.R337H mutation revealed a DNA-binding domain pathogenic mutation, p.G245S, in 1 child. CONCLUSIONS: TP53 p.R337H testing should be offered to Brazilian children diagnosed with ACC and choroid plexus carcinoma. A significant percentage of children with cancer in southern Brazil fulfill the criteria for LFL and should be referred for genetic risk assessment. Cancer 2013. (c) 2013 American Cancer Society",

  "Abstract": "Genomic characterization of recurrent breast and lung tumors developed over the course of 10 years in a 29-year-old patient with a germline TP53 mutation (Li-Fraumeni Syndrome) identified oncogenic alterations in the HER2 and EGFR genes across all tumors, including HER2 amplifications, an EGFR-exon 20 insertion, and the first-in-humans HER2V659E mutation showing a phenotypic convergent evolution toward HER2 and EGFR alterations. Following the identification of HER2-activating events in the most recent lung carcinoma and in circulating tumor cells, we treated the reminiscent metastatic lesions with a lapatinib-based therapy. A symptomatic and radiologic clinical response was achieved. HER2V659E sensitivity to lapatinib was confirmed in the laboratory. SIGNIFICANCE: The precise knowledge of the genomic alterations present in tumors is critical to selecting the optimal treatment for each patient. Here, we report the molecular characterization and clinical response to a lapatinib-based therapy for the tumors of a Li-Fraumeni patient showing prevalence of HER2 and EGFR genomic alterations",

  "Title": "High Frequency of Germline TP53 Mutations in a Prospective Adult-Onset Sarcoma Cohort",
  "Abstract": "Sarcomas are a key feature of Li-Fraumeni and related syndromes (LFS/LFL), associated with germline TP53 mutations. Current penetrance estimates for TP53 mutations are subject to significant ascertainment bias. The International Sarcoma Kindred Study is a clinic-based, prospective cohort of adult-onset sarcoma cases, without regard to family history. The entire cohort was screened for mutations in TP53 using high-resolution melting analysis and Sanger sequencing, and multiplex-ligation-dependent probe amplification and targeted massively parallel sequencing for copy number changes. Pathogenic TP53 mutations were detected in blood DNA of 20/559 sarcoma probands (3.6%); 17 were germline and 3 appeared to be somatically acquired. Of the germline carriers, one appeared to be mosaic, detectable in the tumor and blood, but not epithelial tissues. Germline mutation carriers were more likely to have multiple cancers (47% vs 15% for non-carriers, P \u003d 3.0x10(-3)), and earlier cancer onset (33 vs 48 years, P \u003d 1.19x10(-3)). The median survival of mutation carriers following first cancer diagnosis was not significantly different from non-carriers. Only 10/17 (59%) pedigrees met classical or Chompret criteria for LFS. In summary, germline TP53 mutations are not rare in adult patients with sarcoma, with implications for screening, surveillance, treatment and genetic counselling of carriers and family members",

  "Abstract": "Germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 genes have been identified as one of the most important disease-causing issues in young breast cancer patients worldwide. The specific defective biological processes that trigger germline mutation-associated and -negative tumors remain unclear. To delineate an initial portrait of Brazilian early-onset breast cancer, we performed an investigation combining both germline and tumor analysis. Germline screening of the BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 (c.1100delC) and TP53 genes was performed in 54 unrelated patients \u003c35 y; their tumors were investigated with respect to transcriptional and genomic profiles as well as hormonal receptors and HER2 expression/amplification. Germline mutations were detected in 12 out of 54 patients (22%) [7 in BRCA1 (13%), 4 in BRCA2 (7%) and one in TP53 (2%) gene]. A cancer familial history was present in 31.4% of the unrelated patients, from them 43.7% were carriers for germline mutation (37.5% in BRCA1 and in 6.2% in the BRCA2 genes). Fifty percent of the unrelated patients with hormone receptor-negative tumors carried BRCA1 mutations, percentage increasing to 83% in cases with familial history of cancer. Over-representation of DNA damage-, cellular and cell cycle-related processes was detected in the up-regulated genes of BRCA1/2-associated tumors, whereas cell and embryo development-related processes were over-represented in the up-regulated genes of BRCA1/2-negative tumors, suggesting distinct mechanisms driving the tumorigenesis. An initial portrait of the early-onset breast cancer patients in Brazil was generated pointing out that hormone receptor-negative tumors and positive familial history are two major risk factors for detection of a BRCA1 germline mutation. Additionally, the data revealed molecular factors that potentially trigger the tumor development in young patients",

  "Title": "A young woman with bilateral breast cancer: identifying a genetic cause and implications for management",
  "Abstract": "Breast cancer is a common manifestation of an underlying genetic susceptibility to cancer, and 5% to 10% of all breast cancers are associated with a germline mutation in a known risk allele. Detection of mutations has implications for targeted screening and prevention strategies for probands, and for genetic counseling and testing of their family members. This report presents a case involving a 35-year-old woman with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer who presented with a palpable right breast lump. Imaging revealed multiple bilateral breast masses and right axillary adenopathy, and core needle biopsies showed invasive ductal carcinoma in both the right and left breast. This report discusses the appropriate genetics evaluation for a patient with bilateral breast cancer at a young age, including testing for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, followed, if negative, by consideration of testing for mutations in TP53 (Li-Fraumeni syndrome). Given the specialized counseling and testing needs of patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and the implications for targeted screening strategies if a mutation is found, referral to a cancer genetics expert is strongly recommended",

  "Title": "TP53 p.R337H is a conditional cancer-predisposing mutation: further evidence from a homozygous patient",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) are among the most common childhood cancers occurring in infants affected with the Li-Fraumeni and Li- Fraumeni-like (LFS/LFL) syndromes, which are caused by dominant germline mutations in the TP53 gene. In Brazil, a particular mutation, occurring in the tetramerisation domain of the gene, p.R337H, is exceedingly common due to a founder effect and is strongly associated with ACC. In this report, we describe the phenotype and long-term clinical follow-up of a female child diagnosed with ACC and homozygous for the TP53 p.R337H founder mutation. CASE PRESENTATION: At age 11 months, the patient was diagnosed with a virilising anaplastic adrenal cortical tumour, which was completely excised without disturbing the adrenal capsule. Family history was consistent with an LFL tumour pattern, and genotyping identified the TP53 p.R337H mutation in both alleles in genomic DNA from lymphocytes and fibroblasts. Haplotype analysis confirmed the occurrence of the mutation in the same founder haplotype previously described in other Brazilian patients. No other germline or somatic TP53 mutations or rearrangements were identified. At age 9 years, the child was asymptomatic and had no evidence of endocrine derangements. Full body and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) failed to detect any suspicious proliferative lesions, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing results were within the normal reference for the child\u0027s age, ruling out a major exercise capacity deficiency. CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical and aerobic functional capacity documentation of a patient who carries two mutant TP53 alleles and no wild-type allele. Our results support the hypothesis that TP53 p.R337H, the most common TP53 mutation ever described in any population, is a conditional mutant. Furthermore, our observations over a long period of clinical follow-up suggest that TP53 p.R337H homozygotes do not have a more severe disease phenotype than do heterozygote carriers of the same mutation. Patients with the homozygous TP53 p.R337H genotype will require careful surveillance for lifetime cancer risk and for effects on metabolic capacity later in life",

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Germline genetic testing for familial cancer syndromes is usually performed serially for the most likely genetic causes. In recent years the way genetic testing carried out has changed, as next generation sequencing now allows the simultaneous testing of multiple susceptibility genes at low costs. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present a female with bilateral breast cancer and endometrial adenocarcinoma. After simultaneous sequencing of 150 genes (890 kb) associated with hereditary cancer we identified pathogenic mutations in two high-penetrance genes, i.e. TP53 and CDH1 that would most likely not have been elucidated by serial screening of candidate genes. CONCLUSION: As the two mutated genes are located on different chromosomes and cause different cancer syndromes these findings had a tremendous impact not only on genetic counseling of the index patient and her family but also on subsequent surveillance strategies",

  "Title": "Establishment and characterization of the first pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma xenograft model identifies topotecan as a potential chemotherapeutic agent",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare and highly aggressive malignancy. Conventional chemotherapeutic agents have shown limited utility and are largely ineffective in treating children with advanced ACC. The lack of cell lines and animal models of pediatric ACC has hampered the development of new therapies. Here we report the establishment of the first pediatric ACC xenograft model and the characterization of its sensitivity to selected chemotherapeutic agents. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A tumor from an 11-year-old boy with previously untreated ACC was established as a subcutaneous xenograft in immunocompromised CB17 scid(-/-) mice. The patient harbored a germline TP53 G245C mutation, and the primary tumor showed loss of heterozygosity with retention of the mutated TP53 allele. Histopathology, DNA fingerprinting, gene expression profiling, and biochemical analyses of the xenograft were conducted and compared with the primary tumor and normal adrenal cortex. The second endpoint was to assess the preliminary antitumor activity of selected chemotherapeutic agents. RESULTS: The xenograft maintained the histopathologic and molecular features of the primary tumor. Screening the xenograft for drug responsiveness showed that cisplatin had a potent antitumor effect. However, etoposide, doxorubicin, and a panel of other common cancer drugs had little or no antitumor activity, with the exception of topotecan, which was found to significantly inhibit tumor growth. Consistent with these preclinical findings, topotecan as a single agent in a child with relapsed ACC resulted in disease stabilization. CONCLUSION: Our study established a novel TP53-associated pediatric ACC xenograft and identified topotecan as a potentially effective agent for treating children with this disease",

  "Title": "Impact of neonatal screening and surveillance for the TP53 R337H mutation on early detection of childhood adrenocortical tumors",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The incidence of pediatric adrenocortical tumors (ACTs) is remarkably high in southern Brazil, where more than 90% of patients carry the germline TP53 mutation R337H. We assessed the impact of early detection of this mutation and of surveillance of carriers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Free newborn screening was offered at all hospitals in the state of Parana. Parents of positive newborns were tested, and relatives in the carrier line were offered screening. Positive newborns and their relatives age \u003c 15 years were offered surveillance (periodic clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound evaluations). ACTs detected by imaging were surgically resected. RESULTS: Of 180,000 newborns offered screening, 171,649 were screened, and 461 (0.27%) were carriers. As of April 2012, ACTs had been diagnosed in 11 of these carriers but in only two neonatally screened noncarriers (P \u003c .001); six patient cases were identified among 228 carrier relatives age \u003c 15 years (total, 19 ACTs). Surveillance participants included 347 (49.6%) of 699 carriers. Tumors were smaller in surveillance participants (P \u003c .001) and more advanced in nonparticipants (four with stage III disease; two deaths). Neonatally screened carriers also had neuroblastoma (n \u003d 1), glioblastoma multiforme (n \u003d 1), choroid plexus carcinoma (n \u003d 2), and Burkitt lymphoma (n \u003d 1). Cancer histories and pedigrees were obtained for 353 families that included 1,704 identified carriers. ACTs were the most frequent cancer among carrier children (n \u003d 48). CONCLUSION: These findings establish the prevalence of the TP53 R337H mutation in Parana state and the penetrance of ACTs among carriers. Importantly, screening and surveillance of heterozygous carriers are effective in detecting ACTs when readily curable",

  "Title": "A case of late-onset Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome with unilateral breast cancer",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare, inherited syndrome associated with increased risk of various early-onset tumors. Since the introduction of classic LFS criteria, various criteria have been proposed to include patients with incomplete LFS features, which make up Li-Fraumeni-like syndromes (LFL). Germline missense mutations of TP53 are the primary cause of LFS and LFL. Mutations mostly reside in the DNA-binding domain of the gene and have a dominant-negative effect (DNE) over alternate wild-type alleles. Germline TP53 mutation c.566C\u003eT results in the missense mutation GCC (Ala) to GTC (Val) at codon 189 (A189V) and has been reported in a case of multiple primary colon tumors. Herein we report a second case of the same mutation in a breast cancer patient, who has familial history of late-onset malignancies. Due to the relatively late onset of malignancies, neither case fulfils previously defined criteria for the syndrome. Mutational analysis for breast tissue in this patient showed a loss of heterozygosity. These clinical features may suggest a relatively weak DNE of A189V compared to other TP53 mutations, and in silico predictions and in vitro findings of the function of A189V mutant protein are conflicting. Considering the increased risk of malignancies and the therapeutic implications for patients who have a TP53 mutation, care must be taken when treating those who are suspected of possessing cancer-prone traits due to TP53 mutation, especially when there is a family history of late-onset cancer with low penetrance",

  "Title": "Drastic effect of germline TP53 missense mutations in Li-Fraumeni patients",
  "Abstract": "In contrast to other tumor suppressor genes, the majority of TP53 alterations are missense mutations. We have previously reported that in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), germline TP53 missense mutations are associated with an earlier age of tumor onset. In a larger series, we observed that mean age of tumor onset in patients harboring dominant negative missense mutations and clearly null mutations was 22.6 and 37.5 years, respectively. To assess the impact of heterozygous germline TP53 mutations in the genetic context of the patients, we developed a new functional assay of the p53 pathway on the basis of induction of DNA damage in Epstein-Barr-virus-immortalized lymphocytes, followed by comparative gene-expression profiling. In wild-type lymphocytes, we identified a core of 173 genes whose expression was induced more than twofold, of which 46 were known p53 target genes. In LFS lymphocytes with canonical missense mutations, the number of induced genes and the level of known p53 target genes induction were strongly reduced as compared with controls and LFS lymphocytes with null mutations. These results show that certain germline missense TP53 mutations, such as those with dominant negative effect, dramatically alter the response to DNA damage. This probably explains why TP53 alterations are predominantly missense mutations",

  "Title": "[Radiation-induced Intracranial Osteosarcoma after Radiation for Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Associated with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome]",
  "Abstract": "A 28-year-old man presented with osteosarcoma of the occipital bone 16 years after 24 Gy of craniospinal irradiation for acute lymphocytic leukemia. The tumor had both intra- and extra-cranial components. However, the affected skull appeared to be normal on imaging because of permeative infiltration by the tumor. Subtotal resection was achieved and the tumor was verified histologically as an osteosarcoma. The residual tumor soon showed remarkable enlargement and disseminated to the spinal cord. Both of the enlarged and disseminated tumor masses were treated by surgical intervention and chemotherapy. However, the patient deteriorated due to the tumor regrowth and died 11 months after the initial diagnosis. This patient had previously developed a leukemia, a colon cancer, a rectal cancer and a hepatocellular carcinoma. His brother also died of leukemia. The patient had a heterozygous \u003ci\u003eTP53\u003c/i\u003e germ-line mutation of codon 248 in the exon 7. In conclusion, we consider the present tumor to be a rare example of radiation-induced skull osteosarcoma in a member of the cancer-prone family with \u003ci\u003eTP53\u003c/i\u003e germ-line mutation which is associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome",

  "Title": "Novel p53 splicing site mutation in Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome with osteosarcoma",
  "Abstract": "We describe a 15-year-old girl with a novel germline p53 splice site mutation who developed an osteosarcoma. She received several cycles of chemotherapy with complete resection of the primary tumor without amputation, and has maintained remission for 18 months. Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome was suspected based on familial history. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a novel germline p53 gene mutation resulting in a G to A transition at position +1 at the donor splice site of intron 6, creating a 6 amino acid insertion. This case provides interesting insight into the phenotype-genotype correlation in LFL syndrome with a TP53 splicing mutation",

  "Title": "Whole exome sequencing of pediatric gastric adenocarcinoma reveals an atypical presentation of Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gastric adenocarcinoma is a rare diagnosis in childhood. A 14-year-old male patient presented with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, and a strong family history of colon cancer. Clinical sequencing of CDH1 and APC were negative. Whole exome sequencing was therefore applied to capture the majority of protein-coding regions for the identification of single-nucleotide variants, small insertion/deletions, and copy number abnormalities in the patient\u0027s germline as well as primary tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from the patient\u0027s blood, primary tumor, and the unaffected mother\u0027s blood. DNA libraries were constructed and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000. Data were post-processed using Picard and Samtools, then analyzed with the Genome Analysis Toolkit. Variants were annotated using an in-house Ensembl-based program. Copy number was assessed using ExomeCNV. RESULTS: Each sample was sequenced to a mean depth of coverage of greater than 120x. A rare non-synonymous coding single-nucleotide variant (SNV) in TP53 was identified in the germline. There were 10 somatic cancer protein-damaging variants that were not observed in the unaffected mother genome. ExomeCNV comparing tumor to the patient\u0027s germline, identified abnormal copy number, spanning 6,946 genes. CONCLUSION: We present an unusual case of Li-Fraumeni detected by whole exome sequencing. There were also likely driver somatic mutations in the gastric adenocarcinoma. These results highlight the need for more thorough and broad scale germline and cancer analyses to accurately inform patients of inherited risk to cancer and to identify somatic mutations",

  "Title": "Identification of TP53 as an acute lymphocytic leukemia susceptibility gene through exome sequencing",
  "Abstract": "Although acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, genetic predisposition to ALL remains poorly understood. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in an extended kindred in which five individuals had been diagnosed with leukemia. Analysis revealed a nonsense variant of TP53 which has been previously reported in families with sarcomas and other typical Li Fraumeni syndrome-associated cancers but never in a familial leukemia kindred. This unexpected finding enabled identification of an appropriate sibling bone marrow donor and illustrates that exome sequencing will reveal atypical clinical presentations of even well-studied genes",

  "Title": "Prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in a prospective series of unselected patients with adrenocortical carcinoma",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a hallmark cancer in families with Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) caused by mutations in the TP53 gene. The prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in children diagnosed with ACC ranges from 50-97%. Although existing criteria advocate for TP53 testing in all patients with ACC regardless of age at diagnosis, the overall prevalence of germline mutations in patients diagnosed with ACC has not been well studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 114 patients with confirmed ACC evaluated in the University of Michigan Endocrine Oncology Clinic were prospectively offered genetic counseling and TP53 genetic testing, regardless of age at diagnosis or family history. Ninety-four of the 114 patients met with a genetic counselor (82.5%), with 53 of 94 (56.4%) completing TP53 testing; 9.6% (nine of 94) declined testing. The remainder (32 of 94; 34%) expressed interest in testing but did not pursue it for various reasons. RESULTS: Four of 53 patients in this prospective, unselected series were found to have a TP53 mutation (7.5%). The prevalence of mutations in those diagnosed over age 18 was 5.8% (three of 52). There were insufficient data to estimate the prevalence in those diagnosed under age 18. None of these patients met clinical diagnostic criteria for classic LFS. Three of the families met criteria for Li Fraumeni-like syndrome; one patient met no existing clinical criteria for LFS or Li Fraumeni-like syndrome. Three of the four patients with mutations were diagnosed with ACC after age 45. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic counseling and germline testing for TP53 should be offered to all patients with ACC. Restriction on age at diagnosis or strength of the family history would fail to identify mutation carriers",

  "Title": "Anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma in TP53 germline mutation carriers",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) represents a diverse category of myogenic malignancies with marked differences in molecular alterations and histology. This study examines the question if RMS predisposition due to germline TP53 mutations correlates with certain RMS histologies. METHODS: The histology of RMS tumors diagnosed in 8 consecutive children with TP53 germline mutations was reviewed retrospectively. In addition, germline TP53 mutation analysis was performed in 7 children with anaplastic RMS (anRMS) and previously unknown TP53 status. RESULTS: RMS tumors diagnosed in 11 TP53 germline mutation carriers all exhibited nonalveolar, anaplastic histology as evidenced by the presence of enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei with or without atypical mitotic figures. Anaplastic RMS was the first malignant diagnosis for all TP53 germline mutation carriers in this cohort, and median age at diagnosis was 40 months (mean, 40 months +/- 15 months; range, 19-67 months). The overall frequency of TP53 germline mutations was 73% (11 of 15 children) in pediatric patients with anRMS. The frequency of TP53 germline mutations in children with anRMS was 100% (5 of 5 children) for those with a family cancer history consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), and 80% (4 of 5 children) for those without an LFS cancer phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals harboring germline TP53 mutations are predisposed to develop anRMS at a young age. If future studies in larger anRMS cohorts confirm the findings of this study, the current Chompret criteria for LFS should be extended to include children with anRMS irrespective of family history",

  "Title": "Double heterozygosity for germline mutations in BRCA1 and p53 in a woman with early onset breast cancer",
  "Abstract": "To report on a highly unusual case of a 20-year-old woman who presented with multifocal metaplastic breast cancer and was subsequently found to carry deleterious germline mutations in both BRCA1 and p53. Genetic testing was requested on an expedited basis to assist in surgical decision-making and BRCA1/2 and p53 genetic analysis was ordered concurrently. BRCA1/2 and p53 analyses were completed using a combination of direct DNA sequencing and multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA). The patient was found to carry a deletion of exon 3 of the BRCA1 gene and a splice site mutation at the exon4/intron4 boundary of the p53 gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of double heterozygosity in BRCA1 and p53. The patient\u0027s clinical presentation is highly reminiscent of that predicted by preclinical mouse models. In patients with early onset breast cancer, the possibility of germline mutations in more than one cancer susceptibility gene should be considered. This could have important clinical implications for patients and their at-risk family members",

  "Title": "Further evidence for pathogenicity of the TP53 tetramerization domain mutation p.Arg342Pro in Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare genetic disease with a highly significant predisposition to multiple early-onset neoplasms. These neoplasms include adrenocortical carcinoma, sarcoma, leukemia and CNS tumors in children and sarcoma, breast cancer and lung cancer in adults. LFS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In most patients germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are found. As the majority of known mutations affect the DNA-binding domain of the p53 protein, there are only a few case reports showing the clinical presentation of mutations outside of this mutational hotspot. Here we present a family with a typical LFS pedigree with patients suffering from early-onset lung cancer, bilateral breast cancer and osteosarcoma. TP53 sequence analysis of the index patient revealed the germline mutation c.1025G \u003e C in a heterozygous state, resulting in an amino acid exchange from arginine to proline (p.Arg342Pro) in the tetramerization domain of p53. Using DNA from an old bedside blood typing test, the same mutation was found in the mother of the index patient, who had died of breast cancer 29 years ago. In conclusion, we provide evidence for the co-segregation of a TP53 tetramerization domain mutation and cancer phenotypes, but also report pre-symptomatic mutation carriers within the family. We review published recommendations for clinical management and surveillance of high-risk members in Li-Fraumeni kindreds",

  "Title": "Next-generation sequencing for the diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer using genomic capture targeting multiple candidate genes",
  "Abstract": "To optimize the molecular diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), we developed a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based screening based on the capture of a panel of genes involved, or suspected to be involved in HBOC, on pooling of indexed DNA and on paired-end sequencing in an Illumina GAIIx platform, followed by confirmation by Sanger sequencing or MLPA/QMPSF. The bioinformatic pipeline included CASAVA, NextGENe, CNVseq and Alamut-HT. We validated this procedure by the analysis of 59 patients\u0027 DNAs harbouring SNVs, indels or large genomic rearrangements of BRCA1 or BRCA2. We also conducted a blind study in 168 patients comparing NGS versus Sanger sequencing or MLPA analyses of BRCA1 and BRCA2. All mutations detected by conventional procedures were detected by NGS. We then screened, using three different versions of the capture set, a large series of 708 consecutive patients. We detected in these patients 69 germline deleterious alterations within BRCA1 and BRCA2, and 4 TP53 mutations in 468 patients also tested for this gene. We also found 36 variations inducing either a premature codon stop or a splicing defect among other genes: 5/708 in CHEK2, 3/708 in RAD51C, 1/708 in RAD50, 7/708 in PALB2, 3/708 in MRE11A, 5/708 in ATM, 3/708 in NBS1, 1/708 in CDH1, 3/468 in MSH2, 2/468 in PMS2, 1/708 in BARD1, 1/468 in PMS1 and 1/468 in MLH3. These results demonstrate the efficiency of NGS in performing molecular diagnosis of HBOC.

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND \u0026 AIMS: We investigated the prevalence of germline mutations in APC, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PALB2, PMS2, PRSS1, STK11, and TP53 in patients with pancreatic cancer. METHODS: The Ontario Pancreas Cancer Study enrolls consenting participants with pancreatic cancer from a province-wide electronic pathology database; 708 probands were enrolled from April 2003 through August 2012. To improve the precision of BRCA2 prevalence estimates, 290 probands were selected from 3 strata, based on family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, or neither. Germline DNA was analyzed by next-generation sequencing using a custom multiple-gene panel. Mutation prevalence estimates were calculated from the sample for the entire cohort. RESULTS: Eleven pathogenic mutations were identified: 3 in ATM, 1 in BRCA1, 2 in BRCA2, 1 in MLH1, 2 in MSH2, 1 in MSH6, and 1 in TP53. The prevalence of mutations in all 13 genes was 3.8% (95% confidence interval, 2.1%-5.6%). Carrier status was associated significantly with breast cancer in the proband or first-degree relative (P \u003c .01), and with colorectal cancer in the proband or first-degree relative (P \u003c .01), but not family history of pancreatic cancer, age at diagnosis, or stage at diagnosis. Of patients with a personal or family history of breast and colorectal cancer, 10.7% (95% confidence interval, 4.4%-17.0%) and 11.1% (95% confidence interval, 3.0%-19.1%) carried pathogenic mutations, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A small but clinically important proportion of pancreatic cancer is associated with mutations in known predisposition genes. The heterogeneity of mutations identified in this study shows the value of using a multiple-gene panel in pancreatic cancer",

  "Title": "Genetic evaluation based on family history and Her2 status correctly identifies TP53 mutations in very early onset breast cancer cases",
  "Abstract": "Currently, hereditary breast cancer is being attributed to more than 20 genes of differing penetrance. Although BRCA1 and BRCA2 are still the genes of reference for breast cancer susceptibility, extreme breast cancer phenotypes may be the result of deleterious alleles of other genes. Here, we report three families with early-onset breast cancer that were initially referred for BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic testing. They were diagnosed with breast cancer at an extraordinarily early age. On the basis of their extensive family history, which included multiple cancer types, and their Her2 status, they were suspected for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Indeed, all three probands were found to harbor TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations. These included p.C275X, described here for the first time, as well as p.R213X and p.Y220C, which have been described in the past. Our conclusion is that decisions on genetic analysis for inherited early onset breast cancer should always be based on detailed pedigree information, combined with Her2 status",

  "Title": "The Brazilian Founder Mutation TP53 p.R337H is Uncommon in Portuguese Women Diagnosed with Breast Cancer",
  "Abstract": "Since the first studies reporting the TP53 p.R337H mutation as founder mutation in Southern and Southeastern Brazil, there has been controversy on its origin. Preliminary analysis of a small subset of Brazilian mutation carriers revealed that the haplotype incided on a Caucasian background. The vast majority of carriers identified today reside in Brazil or, if identified in other countries, are Brazilian immigrants. To our knowledge, the only two exceptions of carriers without a recognizable link with Brazil are two European families, from Portugal and Germany. Haplotype analysis in the Portuguese family revealed the same haplotype identified in Brazilian individuals, but in the German family, a distinct haplotype was found. Knowing that a significant proportion of women with breast cancer (BC) in Southern Brazil are p.R337H carriers, we analyzed p.R337H in a Portuguese cohort of women diagnosed with this disease. Median age at diagnosis among the first 573 patients tested was 60 years and 100 (17.4%) patients had been diagnosed at or under the age of 45 years. Mutation screening failed to identify the mutation in the 573 patients tested. These results are in contrast with the mutation frequency observed in a study including 815 BC-affected women from Brazil, in which carrier frequencies of 12.1 and 5.1% in pre- and postmenopausal women were observed, respectively. These findings suggest that the Brazilian founder mutation p.R337H, the most frequent germline TP53 mutation reported to date, is not a common germline alteration in Portuguese women diagnosed with BC",

  "Abstract": "We report the first large-scale exome-wide analysis of the combined germline-somatic landscape in ovarian cancer. Here we analyse germline and somatic alterations in 429 ovarian carcinoma cases and 557 controls. We identify 3,635 high confidence, rare truncation and 22,953 missense variants with predicted functional impact. We find germline truncation variants and large deletions across Fanconi pathway genes in 20% of cases. Enrichment of rare truncations is shown in BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2. In addition, we observe germline truncation variants in genes not previously associated with ovarian cancer susceptibility (NF1, MAP3K4, CDKN2B and MLL3). Evidence for loss of heterozygosity was found in 100 and 76% of cases with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 truncations, respectively. Germline-somatic interaction analysis combined with extensive bioinformatics annotation identifies 222 candidate functional germline truncation and missense variants, including two pathogenic BRCA1 and 1 TP53 deleterious variants. Finally, integrated analyses of germline and somatic variants identify significantly altered pathways, including the Fanconi, MAPK and MLL pathways",

  "Title": "Prevalence of the TP53 p.R337H mutation in breast cancer patients in Brazil",
  "Abstract": "Germline TP53 mutations predispose individuals to multiple cancers and are associated with Li-Fraumeni/Li-Fraumeni-Like Syndromes (LFS/LFL). The founder mutation TP53 p.R337H is detected in 0.3% of the general population in southern Brazil. This mutation is associated with an increased risk of childhood adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) but is also common in Brazilian LFS/LFL families. Breast Cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers diagnosed in TP53 mutation carriers. We have assessed the prevalence of p.R337H in two groups: (1) 59 BC affected women with a familial history (FH) suggestive of hereditary cancer syndrome but no LFS/LFL features; (2) 815 BC affected women unselected for cancer FH, diagnosed with BC at or before age 45 or at age 55 or older. Among group 1 and group 2 patients, 2/59 (3.4%, CI95%: 0.4%-11.7%) and 70/815 (8.6%, CI95%: 6.8%-10.7%), respectively, were p.R337H carriers in the germline. The prevalence of p.R337H was higher in women diagnosed with BC at or before age 45 (12.1%, CI95%: 9.1%-15.8%) than at age 55 or older (5.1%, CI95%: 3.2%-7.7%), p\u003c0.001). The Brazilian founder p.R337H haplotype was detected in all carriers analysed. These results suggest that inheritance of p.R337H may significantly contribute to the high incidence of BC in Brazil, in addition to its recently demonstrated impact on the risk of childhood ACC",

  "Title": "A pathogenic mosaic TP53 mutation in two germ layers detected by next generation sequencing",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by germline TP53 mutations and is clinically characterized by a predisposition to a range of cancers, most commonly sarcoma, brain tumours and leukemia. Pathogenic mosaic TP53 mutations have only rarely been described. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We describe a 2 years old child presenting with three separate cancers over a 6 month period; two soft tissue mesenchymal tumors and an aggressive metastatic neuroblastoma. As conventional testing of blood DNA by Sanger sequencing for mutations in TP53, ALK, and SDH was negative, whole exome sequencing of the blood DNA of the patient and both parents was performed to screen more widely for cancer predisposing mutations. In the patient\u0027s but not the parents\u0027 DNA we found a c.743 G\u003eA, p.Arg248Gln (CCDS11118.1) TP53 mutation in 3-20% of sequencing reads, a level that would not generally be detectable by Sanger sequencing. Homozygosity for this mutation was detected in all tumor samples analyzed, and germline mosaicism was demonstrated by analysis of the child\u0027s newborn blood spot DNA. The occurrence of separate tumors derived from different germ layers suggests that this de novo mutation occurred early in embryogenesis, prior to gastrulation. CONCLUSION: The case demonstrates pathogenic mosaicim, detected by next generation deep sequencing, that arose in the early stages of embryogenesis",

  "Title": "TP53 p.R337H prevalence in a series of Brazilian hereditary breast cancer families",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 5-10% of breast cancers are hereditary. Among hereditary syndromes, Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC) and Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) have received the most attention. HBOC is due to mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and is characterized by breast adenocarcinoma and/or epithelial ovarian carcinoma. LFS is associated with germline mutations in TP53; the most frequent cancer types associated with this syndrome are sarcoma, breast cancer, leukemia, brain tumors and adrenocortical carcinomas. Other cancers related to LFS are found at lower frequencies. In Brazil, especially in the southern part of the country, a specific mutation in the TP53 gene, TP53 p.R337H, occurs at a high frequency in childhood adrenocortical tumors. It has been proposed that this mutation increases breast cancer risk in southern Brazilian women. METHODS: We carried out a case-control study to determine the prevalence of the TP53 p.R337H mutation in 28 female cancer patients attended at the Cancer Genetic Counseling Service of the General Hospital of the University of Sao Paulo Medical School of Ribeirao Preto who fulfilled Hereditary Breast and Ovary Cancer Syndrome genetic test criteria compared to healthy woman (controls). TP53 p.R337H mutation status was determined using the High Resolution Melting (HRM) method, followed by DNA sequencing. Fisher\u0027s test was used to compare the prevalence of TP53 p.R337H in the patient and control groups. RESULTS: Two of the breast cancer cases (7.1%) and none of the controls carried the TP53 p.R337H mutation. At the time of the investigation, both cases fulfilled testing criteria for Hereditary Breast and Ovary Cancer Syndrome but not Li-Fraumeni or Li-Fraumeni-like Syndrome, based on genetic testing criteria of NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (v.1.2010). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that genetic screening of Brazilian breast cancer patients who fulfill Hereditary Breast and Ovary Cancer Syndrome criteria and have a family history that includes other tumors of the LFS/LFL spectrum be tested for the TP53 p.R337H mutation",

  "Title": "Successful treatment of a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and metastatic lung adenocarcinoma harboring synchronous EGFR L858R and ERBB2 extracellular domain S310F mutations with the pan-HER inhibitor afatinib",
  "Abstract": "We report the case of a young, never-smoker woman with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and advanced lung adenocarcinoma refractory to multiple lines of conventional chemotherapy and negative for actionable alterations by routine testing. Comprehensive genomic profiling by clinical-grade next generation sequencing was performed on 3320 exons of 184 cancer-related genes and 37 introns of 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. The tumor was found to harbor both EGFR L858R and ERBB2 S310F alterations and also tested positive for a known TP53 germline mutation. The presence of the EGFR mutation was further validated by direct sequencing. Based on these results, a dual EGFR/ERBB2 inhibitor, afatinib, was chosen for treatment. The patient achieved a rapid, complete, and durable response to afatinib monotherapy, both clinically and radiographically. The treatment was very well tolerated. This unique case raises practical questions as to the challenges of molecular testing and highlights the potential association of p53 mutations with concurrent EGFR and ERBB2 aberrations. As this case powerfully illustrates, the combination of broad genomic profiling and targeted therapy guided by mutational analysis offers the possibility of precision management of refractory advanced adenocarcinoma in the background of neoplastic syndromes",

To understand the mechanism(s) of primary resistance and identify pathways cooperating with aberrant SHH signaling, we sequenced and profiled a large cohort of SHH-MBs (n \u003d 133). SHH pathway mutations involved PTCH1 (across all age groups), SUFU (infants, including germline), and SMO (adults). Children \u003e3 years old harbored an excess of downstream MYCN and GLI2 amplifications and frequent TP53 mutations, often in the germline, all of which were rare in infants and adults. Functional assays in different SHH-MB xenograft models demonstrated that SHH-MBs harboring a PTCH1 mutation were responsive to SMO inhibition, whereas tumors harboring an SUFU mutation or MYCN amplification were primarily resistant",

  "Abstract": "Germline mutations are responsible for familial cancer syndromes which account for approximately 5-10% of all types of cancers. These mutations mainly occur at tumor suppressor genes or genome stability genes, such as DNA repair genes. Here we have identified a cancer predisposition family, in which eight members were inflicted with a wide spectrum of cancer including one diagnosed with lung cancer at 22years old. Sequencing analysis of tumor samples as well as histologically normal specimens identified two germline mutations co-existing in the familial cancer syndrome, the mutation of tumor suppressor gene P53 V157D and mismatch repair gene PMS2 R20Q. We further demonstrate that P53 V157D and/or PMS2 R20Q mutant promotes lung cancer cell proliferation. These two mutants are capable of promoting colony formation in soft agar as well as tumor formation in transgenic drosophila system. Collectively, these data have uncovered the important role of co-existing germline P53 and PMS2 mutations in the familial cancer syndrome development",

  "Title": "Germline TP53 variants and susceptibility to osteosarcoma",
  "Abstract": "The etiologic contribution of germline genetic variation to sporadic osteosarcoma is not well understood. Osteosarcoma is a sentinel cancer of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), in which approximately 70% of families meeting the classic criteria have germline TP53 mutations. We sequenced TP53 exons in 765 osteosarcoma cases. Data were analyzed with chi(2) tests, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards regression models. We observed a high frequency of young osteosarcoma cases (age \u003c30 years) carrying a known LFS- or likely LFS-associated mutation (3.8%) or rare exonic variant (5.7%) with an overall frequency of 9.5%, compared with none in case patients age 30 years and older (P \u003c .001). This high TP53 mutation prevalence in young osteosarcoma cases is statistically significantly greater than the previously reported prevalence of 3% (P \u003d .0024). We identified a novel association between a TP53 rare variant and metastasis at diagnosis of osteosarcoma (rs1800372, odds ratio \u003d 4.27, 95% confidence interval \u003d 1.2 to 15.5, P \u003d .026).

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows for simultaneous sequencing of multiple cancer susceptibility genes and, for an individual, may be more efficient and less expensive than sequential testing. The authors assessed the frequency of deleterious germline mutations among individuals with breast cancer who were referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) gene testing using a panel of 25 genes associated with inherited cancer predisposition. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using NGS in 2158 individuals, including 1781 who were referred for commercial BRCA1/2 gene testing (cohort 1) and 377 who had detailed personal and family history and had previously tested negative for BRCA1/2 mutations (cohort 2). RESULTS: Mutations were identified in 16 genes, most frequently in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM, and PALB2. Among the participants in cohort 1, 9.3% carried a BRCA1/2 mutation, 3.9% carried a mutation in another breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility gene, and 0.3% carried an incidental mutation in another cancer susceptibility gene unrelated to breast or ovarian cancer. In cohort 2, the frequency of mutations in breast/ovarian-associated genes other than BRCA1/2 was 2.9%, and an additional 0.8% had an incidental mutation. In cohort 1, Lynch syndrome-related mutations were identified in 7 individuals. In contrast to BRCA1/2 mutations, neither age at breast cancer diagnosis nor family history of ovarian or young breast cancer predicted for other mutations. The frequency of mutations in genes other than BRCA1/2 was lower in Ashkenazi Jews compared with non-Ashkenazi individuals (P\u003d.026). CONCLUSIONS: Using an NGS 25-gene panel, the frequency of mutations in genes other than BRCA1/2 was 4.3%, and most mutations (3.9%) were identified in genes associated with breast/ovarian cancer",

  "Title": "Germline Mutations in Predisposition Genes in Pediatric Cancer",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence and spectrum of predisposing mutations among children and adolescents with cancer are largely unknown. Knowledge of such mutations may improve the understanding of tumorigenesis, direct patient care, and enable genetic counseling of patients and families. METHODS: In 1120 patients younger than 20 years of age, we sequenced the whole genomes (in 595 patients), whole exomes (in 456), or both (in 69). We analyzed the DNA sequences of 565 genes, including 60 that have been associated with autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition syndromes, for the presence of germline mutations. The pathogenicity of the mutations was determined by a panel of medical experts with the use of cancer-specific and locus-specific genetic databases, the medical literature, computational predictions, and second hits identified in the tumor genome. The same approach was used to analyze data from 966 persons who did not have known cancer in the 1000 Genomes Project, and a similar approach was used to analyze data from an autism study (from 515 persons with autism and 208 persons without autism). RESULTS: Mutations that were deemed to be pathogenic or probably pathogenic were identified in 95 patients with cancer (8.5%), as compared with 1.1% of the persons in the 1000 Genomes Project and 0.6% of the participants in the autism study. The most commonly mutated genes in the affected patients were TP53 (in 50 patients), APC (in 6), BRCA2 (in 6), NF1 (in 4), PMS2 (in 4), RB1 (in 3), and RUNX1 (in 3). A total of 18 additional patients had protein-truncating mutations in tumor-suppressor genes. Of the 58 patients with a predisposing mutation and available information on family history, 23 (40%) had a family history of cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Germline mutations in cancer-predisposing genes were identified in 8.5% of the children and adolescents with cancer. Family history did not predict the presence of an underlying predisposition syndrome in most patients.

  "Title": "Inherited predisposition to breast cancer among African American women",
  "Abstract": "African Americans have a disproportionate burden of aggressive young-onset breast cancer. Genomic testing for inherited predisposition to breast cancer is increasingly common in clinical practice, but comprehensive mutation profiles remain unknown for most minority populations. We evaluated 289 patients who self-identified as African American with primary invasive breast cancer and with personal or family cancer history or tumor characteristics associated with high genetic risk for all classes of germline mutations in known breast cancer susceptibility genes using a validated targeted capture and multiplex sequencing approach. Sixty-eight damaging germline mutations were identified in 65 (22 %, 95 % CI 18-28 %) of the 289 subjects. Proportions of patients with unequivocally damaging mutations in a breast cancer gene were 26 % (47/180; 95 % confident interval [CI] 20-33 %) of those with breast cancer diagnosis before age 45; 25 % (26/103; 95 % CI 17-35 %) of those with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); 29 % (45/156; 95 % CI 22-37 %) of those with a first or second degree relative with breast cancer before age 60 or with ovarian cancer; and 57 % (4/7; 95 % CI 18-90 %) of those with both breast and ovarian cancer. Of patients with mutations, 80 % (52/65) carried mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and 20 % (13/65) carried mutations in PALB2, CHEK2, BARD1, ATM, PTEN, or TP53. The mutational allelic spectrum was highly heterogeneous, with 57 different mutations in 65 patients. Of patients meeting selection criteria other than family history (i.e., with young age at diagnosis or TNBC), 48 % (64/133) had very limited information about the history of cancer in previous generations of their families. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 or another breast cancer gene occur in one in four African American breast cancer patients with early onset disease, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, or TNBC.

  "Title": "Prevalence and Functional Consequence of TP53 Mutations in Pediatric Adrenocortical Carcinoma: A Children\u0027s Oncology Group Study",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare pediatric malignancy. It occurs in excess among individuals with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which results primarily from germline mutations in the TP53 gene. Prior series exploring frequencies of germline TP53 mutation among children with ACC have been small, geographically limited, or subject to referral bias. The functional consequence of mutations has not been related to phenotype. We provide a genotype-phenotype analysis of TP53 mutations in pediatric ACC and propose a model for tissue-specific effects based on adrenocortical ontogeny. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight consecutive, unrelated children with ACC, unselected for family history, underwent germline TP53 sequencing. Rate and distribution of mutations were identified. Functional analysis was performed for novel TP53 variants. Correlation with the International Agency for Research on Cancer p53 database further delineated mutational distribution, association with family history, and risk for multiple primary malignancies (MPMs). RESULTS: Germline mutations were present in 50% of children. These mutations did not correspond to the conventional hotspot mutations. There was a wide range of mutant protein function. Patients bearing alleles encoding protein with higher functionality were less likely to have a strong family cancer history, whereas those with greater loss of function had MPMs and/or positive family history. In patients with MPMs, ACC was the most frequent initial malignancy. Finally, we demonstrated age-dependent rates of TP53 mutation positivity. CONCLUSION: TP53 mutations are prevalent in children with ACC but decline with age. Mutations result in a broad spectrum of functional loss. Effect of individual mutations may predict carrier and familial disease penetrance with potentially broad implications for clinical surveillance and counseling",

  "Title": "Germline TP53 Mutations in Patients With Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer in the Colon Cancer Family Registry",
  "Abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Li-Fraumeni syndrome, usually characterized by germline TP53 mutations, is associated with markedly elevated lifetime risks of multiple cancers, and has been linked to an increased risk of early-onset colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To examine the frequency of germline TP53 alterations in patients with early-onset colorectal cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a multicenter cross-sectional cohort study of individuals recruited to the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) from 1998 through 2007 (genetic testing data updated as of January 2015). Both population-based and clinic-based patients in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand were recruited to the CCFR. Demographic information, clinical history, and family history data were obtained at enrollment. Biospecimens were collected from consenting probands and families, including microsatellite instability and DNA mismatch repair immunohistochemistry results. A total of a 510 individuals diagnosed as having colorectal cancer at age 40 years or younger and lacking a known hereditary cancer syndrome were identified from the CCFR as being potentially eligible. Fifty-three participants were excluded owing to subsequent identification of germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes (n \u003d 47) or biallelic MUTYH mutations (n \u003d 6). INTERVENTIONS: Germline sequencing of the TP53 gene was performed. Identified TP53 alterations were assessed for pathogenicity using literature and international mutation database searches and in silico prediction models. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Frequency of nonsynonymous germline TP53 alterations. RESULTS: Among 457 eligible participants (314, population-based; 143, clinic-based; median age at diagnosis, 36 years [range, 15-40 years]), 6 (1.3%; 95% CI, 0.5%-2.8%) carried germline missense TP53 alterations, none of whom met clinical criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Four of the identified TP53 alterations have been previously described in the literature in probands with clinical features of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and 2 were novel alterations. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a large cohort of patients with early-onset colorectal cancer, germline TP53 mutations were detected at a frequency comparable with the published prevalence of germline APC mutations in colorectal cancer. With the increasing use of multigene next-generation sequencing panels in hereditary cancer risk assessment, clinicians will be faced with the challenge of interpreting the biologic and clinical significance of germline TP53 mutations in families whose phenotypes are atypical for Li-Fraumeni syndrome",

  "Title": "TP53 intron 1 hotspot rearrangements are specific to sporadic osteosarcoma and can cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Somatic mutations of TP53 are among the most common in cancer and germline mutations of TP53 (usually missense) can cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Recently, recurrent genomic rearrangements in intron 1 of TP53 have been described in osteosarcoma (OS), a highly malignant neoplasm of bone belonging to the spectrum of LFS tumors. Using whole-genome sequencing of OS, we found features of TP53 intron 1 rearrangements suggesting a unique mechanism correlated with transcription. Screening of 288 OS and 1,090 tumors of other types revealed evidence for TP53 rearrangements in 46 (16%) OS, while none were detected in other tumor types, indicating this rearrangement to be highly specific to OS. We revisited a four-generation LFS family where no TP53 mutation had been identified and found a 445 kb inversion spanning from the TP53 intron 1 towards the centromere. The inversion segregated with tumors in the LFS family. Cancers in this family had loss of heterozygosity, retaining the rearranged allele and resulting in TP53 expression loss. In conclusion, intron 1 rearrangements cause p53-driven malignancies by both germline and somatic mechanisms and provide an important mechanism of TP53 inactivation in LFS, which might in part explain the diagnostic gap of formerly classified \u0027TP53 wild-type\u0027 LFS",

  "Title": "Identification of a comprehensive spectrum of genetic factors for hereditary breast cancer in a Chinese population by next-generation sequencing",
  "Abstract": "The genetic etiology of hereditary breast cancer has not been fully elucidated. Although germline mutations of high-penetrance genes such as BRCA1/2 are implicated in development of hereditary breast cancers, at least half of all breast cancer families are not linked to these genes. To identify a comprehensive spectrum of genetic factors for hereditary breast cancer in a Chinese population, we performed an analysis of germline mutations in 2,165 coding exons of 152 genes associated with hereditary cancer using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 99 breast cancer patients from families of cancer patients regardless of cancer types. Forty-two deleterious germline mutations were identified in 21 genes of 34 patients, including 18 (18.2%) BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, 3 (3%) TP53 mutations, 5 (5.1%) DNA mismatch repair gene mutations, 1 (1%) CDH1 mutation, 6 (6.1%) Fanconi anemia pathway gene mutations, and 9 (9.1%) mutations in other genes. Of seven patients who carried mutations in more than one gene, 4 were BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, and their average onset age was much younger than patients with only BRCA1/2 mutations. Almost all identified high-penetrance gene mutations in those families fulfill the typical phenotypes of hereditary cancer syndromes listed in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, except two TP53 and three mismatch repair gene mutations. Furthermore, functional studies of MSH3 germline mutations confirmed the association between MSH3 mutation and tumorigenesis, and segregation analysis suggested antagonism between BRCA1 and MSH3. We also identified a lot of low-penetrance gene mutations. Although the clinical significance of those newly identified low-penetrance gene mutations has not been fully appreciated yet, these new findings do provide valuable epidemiological information for the future studies. Together, these findings highlight the importance of genetic testing based on NCCN guidelines and a multi-gene analysis using NGS may be a supplement to traditional genetic counseling",

  "Title": "Occurrence of Neuroblastoma among TP53 p.R337H Carriers",
  "Abstract": "The high incidence of adrenocortical tumors and choroid plexus carcinoma in children from South and Southeastern regions of Brazil is associated with the germline p.R337H mutation of TP53 gene. The concomitant occurrence of neuroblastoma and adrenocortical tumors in pediatric patients harboring the p.R337H mutation at our institution prompted us to investigate the putative association between p.R337H and pediatric neuroblastoma. Genomic DNA samples from 83 neuroblastoma patients referred to a single institution during the period of 2000-2014 were screened for the p.R337H mutation. Available samples from carriers were investigated for both nuclear p53 accumulation and loss of heterozigosity in tumor. Clinical data were obtained from medical records in order to assess the impact of 337H allele on manifestation of the disease. Seven out 83 neuroblastoma patients (8.4%) were carriers of the TP53 p.R337H mutation in our cohort. Immunohistochemical analysis of p.R337H-positive tumors revealed nuclear p53 accumulation. Loss of heterozigosity was not found among available samples. The presence of 337H allele was associated with increased proportion of stage I tumors. Our data indicate that in addition to adrenocortical tumors, choroid plexus carcinoma, breast cancer and osteosarcoma, genetic counseling and clinical surveillance should consider neuroblastoma as a potential neoplasia affecting p.R337H carriers",

  "Title": "Germline TP53 mutational spectrum in French Canadians with breast cancer",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Specific germline mutations in the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility (HBC/HBOC) genes, BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2, have been shown to recur in French Canadians of Quebec, Canada, and this has been attributed to common ancestors. Germline TP53 mutation carriers are known to segregate in Li-Fraumeni syndrome families, which feature young age of onset breast cancer. We have reported rare TP53 mutation carriers in French Canadian HBC families, though none recurred possibly due to the limited number of cancer families investigated. Here we describe TP53 germline mutations found in French Canadian cancer families provided from hereditary cancer clinics; investigate 37 new BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative HBC/HBOC families for the TP53 mutations; and assess the frequency of TP53 mutations in a 1235 French Canadian breast cancer cases not selected for family history of cancer. METHODS: TP53 mutation-positive pedigrees from French Canadian cancer families were provided from local hereditary cancer clinics. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing of all protein encoding exons of TP53 was performed using peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA from breast/ovarian cancer probands from 37 HBC/HBOC families of French Canadian descent. Targeted bidirectional Sanger sequencing assay of regions containing the identified TP53 mutations was performed on 1235 French Canadian breast cancer cases not selected for family history cancer. RESULTS: Five new TP53 mutations were identified in six pedigrees from hereditary cancer clinics. No deleterious mutations were identified in cancer probands from 37 HBC/HBOC families. A targeted mutation screen of the 1235 breast cancer cases identified a c.844C\u003eT [p.Arg282Trp] mutation carrier. This mutation was also found among the six mutation-positive cancer families provided by the local hereditary cancer clinics. The targeted screen also uncovered a new TP53 mutation, c.685T\u003eC [p.Cys229Arg] that was found in two breast cancer cases. All TP53 mutation carriers were among the 656 women with breast cancer diagnosed less than 50 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: In all six new TP53 mutations were identified in French Canadians, where two each occurred in independently ascertained cases/families. Although all newly identified breast cancer mutation carriers reported a family history of cancer, none were consistent with features of Li-Fraumeni syndrome families",

  "Title": "Using a family history questionnaire to identify adult patients with increased genetic risk for sarcoma",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sarcomas in adults can be associated with hereditary cancer syndromes characterized by early-onset predisposition to numerous types of cancer. Because of variability in familial presentation and the largely unexplained genetic basis of sarcomas, ascertainment of patients for whom a genetics evaluation is most indicated poses challenges. We assessed the utility of a Sarcoma Clinic Genetic Screening (scgs) questionnaire in facilitating that task. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2012, 169 patients (median age: 53 years; range: 17-88 years) completed a self-administered scgs questionnaire. A retrospective chart review was completed for all respondents, and descriptive statistics were reported. Probands were divided into two groups depending on whether they did or did not report a family history of Li-Fraumeni syndrome-type cancers. RESULTS: A family history of cancer (as far as 3rd-degree relatives) was reported in 113 of 163 sarcoma patients (69%). Eeles Li-Fraumeni-like (lfl) criteria were fulfilled in 46 probands (28%), Chompret lfl in 21 (13%), Birch lfl in 8 (5%), and classic Li-Fraumeni in none. In the 10 probands tested for TP53 mutations, 1 pathogenic mutation was found. Further investigation of selected families led to the discovery of germline mutations in MLH1, MSH2, and APC genes in 3 individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The scgs questionnaire was useful for ascertaining probands with sarcoma who could benefit from a genetic assessment. The tool allowed us to identify high-risk families fitting the criteria for lfl and, surprisingly, other hereditary cancer syndromes. Similar questionnaires could be used in other cancer-specific clinics to increase awareness of the genetic component of these cancers",

  "Title": "Inherited mutations in 17 breast cancer susceptibility genes among a large triple-negative breast cancer cohort unselected for family history of breast cancer",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Recent advances in DNA sequencing have led to the development of breast cancer susceptibility gene panels for germline genetic testing of patients. We assessed the frequency of mutations in 17 predisposition genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, in a large cohort of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) unselected for family history of breast or ovarian cancer to determine the utility of germline genetic testing for those with TNBC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with TNBC (N \u003d 1,824) unselected for family history of breast or ovarian cancer were recruited through 12 studies, and germline DNA was sequenced to identify mutations. RESULTS: Deleterious mutations were identified in 14.6% of all patients. Of these, 11.2% had mutations in the BRCA1 (8.5%) and BRCA2 (2.7%) genes. Deleterious mutations in 15 other predisposition genes were detected in 3.7% of patients, with the majority observed in genes involved in homologous recombination, including PALB2 (1.2%) and BARD1, RAD51D, RAD51C, and BRIP1 (0.3% to 0.5%). Patients with TNBC with mutations were diagnosed at an earlier age (P \u003c .001) and had higher-grade tumors (P \u003d .01) than those without mutations. CONCLUSION: Deleterious mutations in predisposition genes are present at high frequency in patients with TNBC unselected for family history of cancer. Mutation prevalence estimates suggest that patients with TNBC, regardless of age at diagnosis or family history of cancer, should be considered for germline genetic testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2. Although mutations in other predisposition genes are observed among patients with TNBC, better cancer risk estimates are needed before these mutations are used for clinical risk assessment in relatives",

We show that (i) in the choroid plexus carcinoma, the germline mutation was detected in a homozygous state due to copy-neutral LOH/uniparental disomy, (ii) in the secondary AML, a complex karyotype led to loss of the wild-type TP53 allele, (iii) in the Wilms tumor, the somatic mutation c.814G\u003eA led to compound heterozygosity. The findings show that the complete inactivation of TP53 by different mechanisms is an important step towards tumorigenesis",

  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare cancer predisposition syndrome classically associated with remarkably early onset of cancer in families with a typical spectrum of malignancies, including sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, and adrenocortical carcinoma. Because the risks of cancer development are strikingly high for Li-Fraumeni syndrome, aggressive cancer surveillance is often pursued in these individuals. However, optimal screening methods and intervals for Li-Fraumeni syndrome have yet to be determined. In addition, there may be a significant psychosocial burden to intensive cancer surveillance and some prevention modalities. Here, we describe a case of a young woman with a de novo mutation in TP53 and multiple malignancies, with her most recent cancers found at early, curable stages due to aggressive cancer screening. The potential benefits and risks of intensive cancer surveillance in hereditary cancer syndromes is discussed",

  "Title": "TP53 germline mutation may affect response to anticancer treatments: analysis of an intensively treated Li-Fraumeni family",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder associated with the occurrence of a wide spectrum of early-onset malignancies, the most prevalent being breast cancer and sarcoma. The presence of TP53 germline mutations in the majority of LFS patients suggests a genetic basis for the cancer predisposition. No special recommendations for the treatment of LFS patients have been made to date, except that of minimizing radiation. We hypothesized that TP53 germline mutations may be associated not only with cancer predisposition, but also with lack of response to chemo- and radiotherapy. Here, we present an Austrian LFS family whose members were intensively treated with chemo- and radiotherapy due to cancers that occurred at a predominantly young age, including eight breast cancers in six patients. Material from seven family members was screened for p53 mutation by Sanger sequencing and immunohistochemistry. A rare missense mutation in the tetramerization domain of exon 10 of the TP53 gene was found to segregate with malignant disease in this family. Lack of response to various chemotherapies and radiotherapy could be ascertained by histopathology of surgical specimens after neoadjuvant treatment, by cancer relapse occurring while receiving adjuvant systemic treatment and by the occurrence of second primaries in areas of adjuvant radiation. Our observations suggest that current standards of cancer treatment may not be valid for patients with LFS. In patients with TP53 germline mutation, cytotoxic treatment may bear not only the risk of tumor induction but also the risk of treatment failure",

  "Title": "Combined steroidogenic characters of fetal adrenal and Leydig cells in childhood adrenocortical carcinoma",
  "Abstract": "Although childhood adrenocortical carcinomas (c-ACCs) with a TP53 mutation are known to produce androgens, detailed steroidogenic characters have not been clarified. Here, we examined steroid metabolite profiles and expression patterns of steroidogenic genes in a c-ACC removed from the left adrenal position of a 2-year-old Brazilian boy with precocious puberty, using an atrophic left adrenal gland removed at the time of tumorectomy as a control. The c-ACC produced not only abundant dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate but also a large amount of testosterone via the Delta5 pathway with Delta5-androstenediol rather than Delta4-androstenedione as the primary intermediate metabolite. Furthermore, the c-ACC was associated with elevated expressions of CYP11A1, CYP17A1, POR, HSD17B3, and SULT2A1, a low but similar expression of CYB5A, and reduced expressions of AKR1C3 (HSD17B5) and HSD3B2. Notably, a Leydig cell marker INSL3 was expressed at a low but detectable level in the c-ACC. Furthermore, molecular studies revealed a maternally inherited heterozygous germline TP53 mutation, and several post-zygotic genetic aberrations in the c-ACC including loss of paternally derived chromosome 17 with a wildtype TP53 and loss of maternally inherited chromosome 11 and resultant marked hyperexpression of paternally expressed growth promoting gene IGF2 and drastic hypoexpression of maternally expressed growth suppressing gene CDKN1C. These results imply the presence of combined steroidogenic properties of fetal adrenal and Leydig cells in this patient\u0027s c-ACC with a germline TP53 mutation and several postzygotic carcinogenic events",

  "Title": "Genetic features of myelodysplastic syndrome and aplastic anemia in pediatric and young adult patients",
  "Abstract": "The clinical and histopathological distinctions between inherited versus acquired bone marrow failure and myelodysplastic syndromes are challenging. The identification of inherited bone marrow failure/myelodysplastic syndromes is critical to inform appropriate clinical management. To investigate whether a subset of pediatric and young adults undergoing transplant for aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome have germline mutations in bone marrow failure/myelodysplastic syndrome genes, we performed a targeted genetic screen of samples obtained between 1990-2012 from children and young adults with aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome transplanted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Mutations in inherited bone marrow failure/myelodysplastic syndrome genes were found in 5.1% (5/98) of aplastic anemia patients and 13.6% (15/110) of myelodysplastic syndrome patients. While the majority of mutations were constitutional, a RUNX1 mutation present in the peripheral blood at a 51% variant allele fraction was confirmed to be somatically acquired in one myelodysplastic syndrome patient. This highlights the importance of distinguishing germline versus somatic mutations by sequencing DNA from a second tissue or from parents. Pathological mutations were present in DKC1, MPL, and TP53 among the aplastic anemia cohort, and in FANCA, GATA2, MPL, RTEL1, RUNX1, SBDS, TERT, TINF2, and TP53 among the myelodysplastic syndrome cohort. Family history or physical examination failed to reliably predict the presence of germline mutations. This study shows that while any single specific bone marrow failure/myelodysplastic syndrome genetic disorder is rare, screening for these disorders in aggregate identifies a significant subset of patients with inherited bone marrow failure/myelodysplastic syndrome",

  "Title": "Genetic characterization of early onset ovarian carcinoma",
  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Ovarian carcinoma (OC) is rare in young women and the fraction of early onset OC attributable to inherited mutations in known OC genes is uncertain. We sought to characterize the fraction of OC that is heritable in women diagnosed with ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal carcinoma at forty years of age or younger. METHODS: We sequenced germline DNA from forty-seven women diagnosed with OC at age 40 or younger ascertained through a gynecologic oncology tissue bank or referred from outside providers using BROCA, a targeted capture and massively parallel sequencing platform that can detect all mutation classes. We evaluated 11 genes associated with ovarian carcinoma (BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PALB2, PMS2, RAD51D, and RAD51C) and additional candidate genes in DNA repair (ATM, BAP1, CHEK2, MRE11A, NBN, PTEN, TP53). We counted only clearly damaging mutations. RESULTS: Damaging mutations in OC genes were identified in 13 of 47 (28%) subjects, of which 10 (77%) occurred in BRCA1 and one each occurred in BRCA2, MSH2, and RAD51D. Women with a strong family history were no more likely to have an OC gene mutation (8/17, 47%) than those without a strong family history (9/30, 30%, P\u003d0.35). Additionally, damaging mutations in non-OC genes were identified, one in NBN and one in CHEK2. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of young women with invasive OC have mutations in BRCA1, and a smaller fraction have mutations in other known OC genes. Family history was not associated with mutation status in these early onset cases",

  "Abstract": "Importance: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has the potential to reveal tumor and germline mutations of clinical relevance, but the diagnostic yield for pediatric patients with solid tumors is unknown. Objective: To characterize the diagnostic yield of combined tumor and germline WES for children with solid tumors. Design: Unselected children with newly diagnosed and previously untreated central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS solid tumors were prospectively enrolled in the BASIC3 study at a large academic children\u0027s hospital during a 23-month period from August 2012 through June 2014. Blood and tumor samples underwent WES in a certified clinical laboratory with genetic results categorized on the basis of perceived clinical relevance and entered in the electronic health record. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical categorization of somatic mutations; frequencies of deleterious germline mutations related to patient phenotype and incidental medically-actionable mutations. Results: Of the first 150 participants (80 boys and 70 girls, mean age, 7.4 years), tumor samples adequate for WES were available from 121 patients (81%). Somatic mutations of established clinical utility (category I) were reported in 4 (3%) of 121 patients, with mutations of potential utility (category II) detected in an additional 29 (24%) of 121 patients. CTNNB1 was the gene most frequently mutated, with recurrent mutations in KIT, TSC2, and MAPK pathway genes (BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS) also identified. Mutations in consensus cancer genes (category III) were found in an additional 24 (20%) of 121 tumors. Fewer than half of somatic mutations identified were in genes known to be recurrently mutated in the tumor type tested. Diagnostic germline findings related to patient phenotype were discovered in 15 (10%) of 150 cases: 13 pathogenic or likely pathogenic dominant mutations in adult and pediatric cancer susceptibility genes (including 2 each in TP53, VHL, and BRCA1), 1 recessive liver disorder with hepatocellular carcinoma (TJP2), and 1 renal diagnosis (CLCN5). Incidental findings were reported in 8 (5%) of 150 patients. Most patients harbored germline uncertain variants in cancer genes (98%), pharmacogenetic variants (89%), and recessive carrier mutations (85%). Conclusions and Relevance: Tumor and germline WES revealed mutations in a broad spectrum of genes previously implicated in both adult and pediatric cancers. Combined reporting of tumor and germline WES identified diagnostic and/or potentially actionable findings in nearly 40% of newly diagnosed pediatric patients with solid tumors",

  "Title": "Inherited breast cancer predisposition in Asians: multigene panel testing outcomes from Singapore",
  "Abstract": "Genetic testing for germline mutations in breast cancer predisposition genes can potentially identify individuals at a high risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. There is a paucity of such mutational information for Asians. Panel testing of 25 cancer susceptibility genes and BRCA1/2 deletion/duplication analysis was performed for 220 Asian breast cancer patients or their family members referred for genetics risk assessment. All 220 participants had at least one high-risk feature: having a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer in first- and/or second-degree relatives; having breast and ovarian cancer in the same individual or bilateral breast cancer; having early-onset breast cancer or ovarian cancer (40 years of age). We identified 67 pathogenic variants in 66 (30.0%) patients. Of these, 19 (28.3%) occurred in BRCA1, 16 (23.9%) in BRCA2, 7 (10.4%) in PALB2, 6 (9.0%) in TP53, 2 (3.0%) in PTEN, 2 (3.0%) in CDH1 and 15 (22.4%) in other predisposition genes. Notably, 47.8% of pathogenic variants were in non-BRCA1/2 genes. Of the 66 patients with pathogenic mutations, 63.6% (42/66) were under the age of 40 years. Family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer is enriched in patients with BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants but less predictive for non-BRCA1/2 related pathogenic variations. We detected a median of three variants of unknown significance (VUS) per gene (range 0-21). Custom gene panel testing is feasible and useful for the detection of pathogenic mutations and should be done in the setting of a formal clinical cancer genetics service given the rate of VUS",

  "Abstract": "Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare familial cancer predisposition syndrome with autosomal-dominant inheritance, occurring as frequently as one in 5,000-20,000 individuals. However, no LFS case has been reported from mainland China although it constitutes one quarter of population on earth. In this study, we identified, to our best knowledge, the first Li Fraumeni syndrome family in China. Six family members were affected with various tumors. A TP53 mutation (c.730G \u003e A; p.G244S) co-segregated with the tumor phenotype within this family. Functional analysis indicated that G244S mutation disrupted the transactivity, DNA-binding and cell growth inhibition activity of p53 protein. Two available tumor samples (medulloblastoma and choroid plexus papilloma) underwent large rearrangement in the chromosomes and loss of wild-type TP53. Our data warranted further studies on the prevalence of germline TP53 mutation in various tumor patients in China",

  "Title": "Multiple gene sequencing for risk assessment in patients with early-onset or familial breast cancer",
  "Abstract": "Since BRCA mutations are only responsible for 10-20% of cases of breast cancer in patients with early-onset or a family history and since next-generation sequencing technology allows the simultaneous sequencing of a large number of target genes, testing for multiple cancer-predisposing genes is now being considered, but its significance in clinical practice remains unclear. We then developed a sequencing panel containing 68 genes that had cancer risk association for patients with early-onset or familial breast cancer. A total of 133 patients were enrolled and 30 (22.6%) were found to carry germline deleterious mutations, 9 in BRCA1, 11 in BRCA2, 2 in RAD50, 2 in TP53 and one each in ATM, BRIP1, FANCI, MSH2, MUTYH, and RAD51C. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was associated with the highest mutation rate (45.5%, p \u003d 0.025). Seven of the 9 BRCA1 mutations and the single FANCI mutation were in the TNBC group; 9 of the 11 BRCA2, 1 of the 2 RAD50 as well as BRIP1, MSH2, MUTYH, and RAD51C mutations were in the hormone receptor (HR)(+)Her2(-) group, and the other RAD50, ATM, and TP53 mutations were in the HR(+)Her2(+) group. Mutation carriers were considered as high-risk to develop malignancy and advised to receive cancer screening. Screening protocols of non-BRCA genes were based on their biologic functions; for example, patients carrying RAD51C mutation received a screening protocol similar to that for BRCA, since BRCA and RAD51C are both involved in homologous recombination. In conclusion, we consider that multiple gene sequencing in cancer risk assessment is clinically valuable",

  "Title": "Pathogenic Mutations in Cancer-Predisposing Genes: A Survey of 300 Patients with Whole-Genome Sequencing and Lifetime Electronic Health Records",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether and how whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data can be used to implement genomic medicine. Our objective is to retrospectively evaluate whether WGS can facilitate improving prevention and care for patients with susceptibility to cancer syndromes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed genetic mutations in 60 autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition genes in 300 deceased patients with WGS data and nearly complete long-term (over 30 years) medical records. To infer biological insights from massive amounts of WGS data and comprehensive clinical data in a short period of time, we developed an in-house analysis pipeline within the SeqHBase software framework to quickly identify pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. The clinical data of the patients who carried pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic variants were further reviewed to assess their clinical conditions using their lifetime EHRs. Among the 300 participants, 5 (1.7%) carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 5 cancer-predisposing genes: one in APC, BRCA1, BRCA2, NF1, and TP53 each. When assessing the clinical data, each of the 5 patients had one or more different types of cancers, fully consistent with their genetic profiles. Among these 5 patients, 2 died due to cancer while the others had multiple disorders later in their lifetimes; however, they may have benefited from early diagnosis and treatment for healthier lives, had the patients had genetic testing in their earlier lifetimes. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a case study where the discovery of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline mutations from population-wide WGS correlates with clinical outcome. The use of WGS may have clinical impacts to improve healthcare delivery",

  "Title": "Undefined familial colorectal cancer and the role of pleiotropism in cancer susceptibility genes",
  "Abstract": "Although family history is a major risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) a genetic diagnosis cannot be obtained in over 50 % of familial cases when screened for known CRC cancer susceptibility genes. The genetics of undefined-familial CRC is complex and recent studies have implied additional clinically actionable mutations for CRC in susceptibility genes for other cancers. To clarify the contribution of non-CRC susceptibility genes to undefined-familial CRC we conducted a mutational screen of 114 cancer susceptibility genes in 847 patients with early-onset undefined-familial CRC and 1609 controls by analysing high-coverage exome sequencing data. We implemented American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics standards and guidelines for assigning pathogenicity to variants. Globally across all 114 cancer susceptibility genes no statistically significant enrichment of likely pathogenic variants was shown (6.7 % cases 57/847, 5.3 % controls 85/1609; P \u003d 0.15). Moreover there was no significant enrichment of mutations in genes such as TP53 or BRCA2 which have been proposed for clinical testing in CRC. In conclusion, while we identified genes that may be considered interesting candidates as determinants of CRC risk warranting further research, there is currently scant evidence to support a role for genes other than those responsible for established CRC syndromes in the clinical management of familial CRC",

  "Title": "Evaluation of Patients and Families With Concern for Predispositions to Hematologic Malignancies Within the Hereditary Hematologic Malignancy Clinic (HHMC)",
  "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although multiple predispositions to hematologic malignancies exist, evaluations for hereditary cancer syndromes (HCS) are underperformed by most hematologist/oncologists. Criteria for initiating HCS evaluation are poorly defined, and results of genetic testing for hereditary hematologic malignancies have not been systematically reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 2014 to August 2015, 67 patients were referred to the Hereditary Hematologic Malignancy Clinic (HHMC). Referral reasons included (1) bone marrow failure or myelodysplastic syndrome in patients \u003c/\u003d 50 years, (2) evaluation for germ-line inheritance of identified RUNX1, GATA2, or CEBPA mutations on targeted next-generation sequencing panels, and (3) strong personal and/or family history of malignancy. Cultured skin fibroblasts were utilized for germ-line DNA in all patients with hematologic malignancy. RESULTS: Eight patients (12%) were clinically diagnosed with a HCS: 4 patients with RUNX1-related familial platelet disorder (FPD)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 1 patient each with dyskeratosis congenita, Fanconi anemia, germ-line DDX41, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Two patients with concern for FPD/AML and LFS, respectively, had RUNX1 and TP53 variants of unknown significance. Additionally, 4 patients with prior HCS diagnosis (1 LFS, 3 FPD/AML) were referred for further evaluation and surveillance. CONCLUSION: In this HHMC-referred hematologic malignancy cohort, HCS was confirmed in 12 patients (18%). HCS identification provides insight for improved and individualized treatment, as well as screening/surveillance opportunities for family members. The HHMC has facilitated HCS diagnosis; with increased clinical awareness of hematologic malignancy predisposition syndromes, more patients who may benefit from evaluation can be identified. Mutation panels intended for prognostication may provide increased clinical suspicion for germ-line testing",

  "Title": "Biochemical and imaging surveillance in germline TP53 mutation carriers with Li-Fraumeni syndrome: 11 year follow-up of a prospective observational study",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Carriers of a germline TP53 pathogenic variant have a substantial lifetime risk of developing cancer. In 2011, we did a prospective observational study of members of families who chose to either undergo a comprehensive surveillance protocol for individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome or not. We sought to update our assessment of and modify the surveillance protocol, so in this study we report both longer follow-up of these patients and additional patients who underwent surveillance, as well as update the originally presented surveillance protocol. METHODS: A clinical surveillance protocol using physical examination and frequent biochemical and imaging studies (consisting of whole-body MRI, brain MRI, breast MRI, mammography, abdominal and pelvic ultrasound, and colonoscopy) was introduced at three tertiary care centres in Canada and the USA on Jan 1, 2004, for carriers of TP53 pathogenic variants. After confirmation of TP53 mutation, participants either chose to undergo surveillance or chose not to undergo surveillance. Patients could cross over between groups at any time. The primary outcome measure was detection of asymptomatic tumours by surveillance investigations. The secondary outcome measure was 5 year overall survival established from a tumour diagnosed symptomatically (in the non-surveillance group) versus one diagnosed by surveillance. We completed survival analyses using an as-treated approach. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2004, and July 1, 2015, we identified 89 carriers of TP53 pathogenic variants in 39 unrelated families, of whom 40 (45%) agreed to surveillance and 49 (55%) declined surveillance. 19 (21%) patients crossed over from the non-surveillance to the surveillance group, giving a total of 59 (66%) individuals undergoing surveillance for a median of 32 months (IQR 12-87). 40 asymptomatic tumours have been detected in 19 (32%) of 59 patients who underwent surveillance. Two additional cancers were diagnosed between surveillance assessments (false negatives) and two biopsied lesions were non-neoplastic entities on pathological review (false positives). Among the 49 individuals who initially declined surveillance, 61 symptomatic tumours were diagnosed in 43 (88%) patients. 21 (49%) of the 43 individuals not on surveillance who developed cancer were alive compared with 16 (84%) of the 19 individuals undergoing surveillance who developed cancer (p\u003d0.012) after a median follow-up of 46 months (IQR 22-72) for those not on surveillance and 38 months (12-86) for those on surveillance. 5 year overall survival was 88.8% (95% CI 78.7-100) in the surveillance group and 59.6% (47.2-75.2) in the non-surveillance group (p\u003d0.0132). INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that long-term compliance with a comprehensive surveillance protocol for early tumour detection in individuals with pathogenic TP53 variants is feasible and that early tumour detection through surveillance is associated with improved long-term survival. Incorporation of this approach into clinical management of these patients should be considered.

  "Title": "Detection of Germline Mutation in Hereditary Breast and/or Ovarian Cancers by Next-Generation Sequencing on a Four-Gene Panel",
  "Abstract": "Mutation in BRCA1/BRCA2 genes accounts for 20% of familial breast cancers, 5% to 10% of which may be due to other less penetrant genes which are still incompletely studied. Herein, a four-gene panel was used to examine the prevalence of BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, and PTEN in hereditary breast and ovarian cancers in Southern Chinese population. In this cohort, 948 high-risk breast and/or ovarian patients were recruited for genetic screening by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The performance of our NGS pipeline was evaluated with 80 Sanger-validated known mutations and eight negative cases. With appropriate bioinformatics analysis pipeline, the detection sensitivity of NGS is comparable with Sanger sequencing. The prevalence of BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations was 9.4% in our Chinese cohort, of which 48.8% of the mutations arose from hotspot mutations. With the use of a tailor-made algorithm, HomopolymerQZ, more mutations were detected compared with single mutation detection algorithm. The frequencies of PTEN and TP53 were 0.21% and 0.53%, respectively, in the Southern Chinese patients with breast and/or ovarian cancers. High-throughput NGS approach allows the incorporation of control cohort that provides an ethnicity-specific data for polymorphic variants. Our data suggest that hotspot mutations screening such as SNaPshot could be an effective preliminary screening alternative adopted in a standard clinical laboratory without NGS setup",

  "Title": "Incidental germline variants in 1000 advanced cancers on a prospective somatic genomic profiling protocol",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing in cancer research may reveal germline variants of clinical significance. We report patient preferences for return of results and the prevalence of incidental pathogenic germline variants (PGVs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Targeted exome sequencing of 202 genes was carried out in 1000 advanced cancers using tumor and normal DNA in a research laboratory. Pathogenic variants in 18 genes, recommended for return by The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, as well as PALB2, were considered actionable. Patient preferences of return of incidental germline results were collected. Return of results was initiated with genetic counseling and repeat CLIA testing. RESULTS: Of the 1000 patients who underwent sequencing, 43 had likely PGVs: APC (1), BRCA1 (11), BRCA2 (10), TP53 (10), MSH2 (1), MSH6 (4), PALB2 (2), PTEN (2), TSC2 (1), and RB1 (1). Twenty (47%) of 43 variants were previously known based on clinical genetic testing. Of the 1167 patients who consented for a germline testing protocol, 1157 (99%) desired to be informed of incidental results. Twenty-three previously unrecognized mutations identified in the research environment were confirmed with an orthogonal CLIA platform. All patients approached decided to proceed with formal genetic counseling; in all cases where formal genetic testing was carried out, the germline variant of concern validated with clinical genetic testing. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, 2.3% patients had previously unrecognized pathogenic germline mutations in 19 cancer-related genes. Thus, genomic sequencing must be accompanied by a plan for return of germline results, in partnership with genetic counseling",

  "Title": "Genetic testing in a cohort of young patients with HER2-amplified breast cancer",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Young age at diagnosis for breast cancer raises the question of genetic susceptibility. We explored breast cancer susceptibility genes testing on \u003c/\u003d40-year-old patients with HER2-amplified invasive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were selected from a large UK cohort study. The inclusion criterion was age \u003c/\u003d40 at diagnosis with confirmed HER2-amplified breast cancer. The probability of finding a BRCA gene mutation was calculated based on family history. Genetic testing used was either clinical testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2, with a subset also tested for TP53 mutations, or research-based testing using a typical panel comprising 17 breast cancer susceptibility genes (CSGs) including BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53. RESULTS: Of the 591 eligible patients, clinical testing results were available for 133 cases and an additional 263 cases had panel testing results. BRCA testing across 396 cases found 8 BRCA2 (2%) and 6 BRCA1 (2%) pathogenic mutations. Of the 304 patients tested for TP53 mutations, overall 9 (3%) had deleterious TP53 mutations. Of the 396 patients, 101 (26%) met clinical criteria for BRCA testing (\u003e/\u003d10% probability), among whom 11% had pathogenic BRCA mutations (6 BRCA2, 5 BRCA1). Where the probability was calculated to be \u003c10%, only 4 of 295 (1%) patients had BRCA mutations. Among the 59 patients who had TP53 testing meeting the 10% threshold, 7 had mutations (12%). Likely functionally deleterious mutations in 14 lower penetrance CSGs were present in 12 of 263 (5%) panel-tested patients. CONCLUSION: Patients aged \u003c41 at diagnosis with HER2+ breast cancer and no family history of breast cancer can be reassured that they have a low chance of being a high-risk gene carrier. If there is a strong family history, not only BRCA but also TP53 gene testing should be considered. The clinical utility of testing lower penetrance CSGs remains unclear",

  "Title": "Does PTEN gene mutation play any role in Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is one of the most serious hereditary cancer syndromes with a high risk of malignancy in childhood. This syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposing syndrome due to a germline mutation in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. METHODS: In this study, a representative family case of Li-Fraumeni syndrome is described. The proband of this family was a 43-year-old male who had osteosarcoma of the mandible and a positive family history of cancer. His mother died at the age of 29 of brain cancer; his sister died at the age of 18 of breast cancer; his brother died at the age of 36 of liver cancer; and another sister of his died at the age of 16 of leukemia. Complete sequence analysis of the TP53 and PTEN genes was performed in this family. We used standard diagnostic tools such as sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to analyze these two genes in this family. The exons and flanking exon-intron junctions of the TP53 and PTEN genes were sequenced. RESULTS: We detected a germline mutation in the TP53 gene in this family that was previously reported as somatic mutation in LFS in the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC). In addition, according to the International Agency for Research of Cancer (IARC) database, a 19-year-old male patient with sarcoma was recently reported to have this germline mutation. We also found two new IVS variations in the PTEN gene, one of which can be a suggestive evidence of an effect on the splicing of PTEN. CONCLUSION: Genomic modifications for tumor risk and genotype-phenotype correlations in LFS are still to be identified. We believe every new finding in this area can provide new insights into the pathogenesis and progression of Li-Fraumeni syndrome",

  "Title": "Multiple primary tumors in a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome with a TP53 germline mutation identified by next-generation sequencing",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder occurring at a young age that predisposes individuals to multiple forms of cancer and to a heterogeneous spectrum of malignancies. We describe the clinical history of a patient who had 5 primary malignant cancers and a familiar history consistent with LFS. We analyzed the genomic DNA of the proband and her relatives by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology using an enrichment protocol for the simultaneous sequencing of 94 genes involved in hereditary cancers. Genetic analysis of the proband revealed a TP53 germline mutation in exon 5 determining a nucleotide alteration at codon 175 (R175H), a hot spot mutation site related to LFS and a reported pathogenic mutation. The proband daughter\u0027s and brother\u0027s DNA did not carry the TP53 mutation but they had some rare variants in common with the proband, in addition to other variants with a still unclear role. In conclusion, we identified a TP53 mutation in a patient with multiple primary tumors and a family history characterized by a severe susceptibility to cancer. The genetic analysis by targeted NGS led to the identification of the genetic background and to the exclusion of a cancer risk for the family members. Targeted NGS represents an efficient approach for the identification of mutations in families with a heterogeneous phenotype",

  "Title": "Panel Testing for Familial Breast Cancer: Calibrating the Tension Between Research and Clinical Care",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Gene panel sequencing is revolutionizing germline risk assessment for hereditary breast cancer. Despite scant evidence supporting the role of many of these genes in breast cancer predisposition, results are often reported to families as the definitive explanation for their family history. We assessed the frequency of mutations in 18 genes included in hereditary breast cancer panels among index cases from families with breast cancer and matched population controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases (n \u003d 2,000) were predominantly breast cancer-affected women referred to specialized Familial Cancer Centers on the basis of a strong family history of breast cancer and BRCA1 and BRCA2 wild type. Controls (n \u003d 1,997) were cancer-free women from the LifePool study. Sequencing data were filtered for known pathogenic or novel loss-of-function mutations. RESULTS: Excluding 19 mutations identified in BRCA1 and BRCA2 among the cases and controls, a total of 78 cases (3.9%) and 33 controls (1.6%) were found to carry potentially actionable mutations. A significant excess of mutations was only observed for PALB2 (26 cases, four controls) and TP53 (five cases, zero controls), whereas no mutations were identified in STK11. Among the remaining genes, loss-of-function mutations were rare, with similar frequency between cases and controls. CONCLUSION: The frequency of mutations in most breast cancer panel genes among individuals selected for possible hereditary breast cancer is low and, in many cases, similar or even lower than that observed among cancer-free population controls. Although multigene panels can significantly aid in cancer risk management and expedite clinical translation of new genes, they equally have the potential to provide clinical misinformation and harm at the individual level if the data are not interpreted cautiously",

  "Title": "Genetic analysis in a patient with nine primary malignant neoplasms: a rare case of Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "To identify rare mutations and retrospectively estimate the cancer risk of a 45-year old female patient diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), who developed nine primary malignant neoplasms in a period of 38 years, we conducted next-generation sequencing in this patient. Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing were performed in DNA of whole blood obtained a year prior to the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and at the time of diagnosis of AML, respectively. We analyzed rare mutations in cancer susceptibility genes using a candidate strategy and estimated cancer risk using the Risk-O-Gram algorithm. We found rare mutations in cancer susceptibility genes associated with an increased hereditary cancer risk in the patient. Notably, the number of mutated genes in p53 signaling pathway was significantly higher than expected (p\u003d0.02). However, the phenotype of multiple malignant neoplasms of the studied patient was unlikely to be caused by accumulation of common cancer risk alleles. In conclusion, we established the mutation profile in a rare case of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, illustrating that the rare mutations rather than the cumulative of common risk alleles leading to an increased cancer risk in the patient",

  "Title": "Germline TP53 Mutation and Clinical Characteristics of Korean Patients With Li-Fraumeni Syndrome",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Little is known of the mutation and tumor spectrum of Korean patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Owing to the rarity of LFS, few cases have been reported in Korea thus far. This study aimed to retrospectively review the mutations and clinical characteristics of Korean patients with LFS. METHODS: TP53 mutation was screened in 89 unrelated individuals at the Samsung Medical Center in Korea, from 2004 to 2015. Six additional mutation carriers were obtained from the literature. RESULTS: We identified nine different mutations in 14 Korean patients (male to female ratio\u003d0.3:1). Two such frameshift mutations (p.Pro98Leufs*25, p.Pro27Leufs*17) were novel. The recurrent mutations were located at codons 31 (n\u003d2; p.Val31Ile), 175 (n\u003d3; p.Arg175His), and 273 (n\u003d4; p.Arg273His and p.Arg273Cys). The median age at the first tumor onset was 25 yr. Ten patients (71%) developed multiple primary tumors. A diverse spectrum of tumors was observed, including breast (n\u003d6), osteosarcoma (n\u003d4), brain (n\u003d4), leukemia (n\u003d2), stomach (n\u003d2), thyroid (n\u003d2), lung (n\u003d2), skin (n\u003d2), bladder (n\u003d1), nasal cavity cancer (n\u003d1), and adrenocortical carcinoma (n\u003d1). CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable heterogeneity in the TP53 mutations and tumor spectrum in Korean patients with LFS. Our results suggest shared and different LFS characteristics between Caucasian and Korean patients. This is the first report on the mutation spectrum and clinical characteristics from the largest series of Korean LFS patients",

  "Title": "Targeted massively parallel sequencing of a panel of putative breast cancer susceptibility genes in a large cohort of multiple-case breast and ovarian cancer families",
  "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gene panel testing for breast cancer susceptibility has become relatively cheap and accessible. However, the breast cancer risks associated with mutations in many genes included in these panels are unknown. METHODS: We performed custom-designed targeted sequencing covering the coding exons of 17 known and putative breast cancer susceptibility genes in 660 non-BRCA1/2 women with familial breast cancer. Putative deleterious mutations were genotyped in relevant family members to assess co-segregation of each variant with disease. We used maximum likelihood models to estimate the breast cancer risks associated with mutations in each of the genes. RESULTS: We found 31 putative deleterious mutations in 7 known breast cancer susceptibility genes (TP53, PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, CDH1, PTEN and STK11) in 45 cases, and 22 potential deleterious mutations in 31 cases in 8 other genes (BARD1, BRIP1, MRE11, NBN, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D and CDK4). The relevant variants were then genotyped in 558 family members. Assuming a constant relative risk of breast cancer across age groups, only variants in CDH1, CHEK2, PALB2 and TP53 showed evidence of a significantly increased risk of breast cancer, with some supportive evidence that mutations in ATM confer moderate risk. CONCLUSIONS: Panel testing for these breast cancer families provided additional relevant clinical information for \u003c2% of families. We demonstrated that segregation analysis has some potential to help estimate the breast cancer risks associated with mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes, but very large case-control sequencing studies and/or larger family-based studies will be needed to define the risks more accurately",

  "Title": "Inherited mutations in cancer susceptibility genes are common among survivors of breast cancer who develop therapy-related leukemia",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Risk factors for the development of therapy-related leukemia (TRL), an often lethal late complication of cytotoxic therapy, remain poorly understood and may differ for survivors of different malignancies. Survivors of breast cancer (BC) now account for the majority of TRL cases, making the study of TRL risk factors in this population a priority. METHODS: Subjects with TRL after cytotoxic therapy for a primary BC were identified from the TRL registry at The University of Chicago. Those with an available germline DNA sample were screened with a comprehensive gene panel covering known inherited BC susceptibility genes. Clinical and TRL characteristics of all subjects and those with identified germline mutations were described. RESULTS: Nineteen of 88 survivors of BC with TRL (22%) had an additional primary cancer and 40 of the 70 survivors with an available family history (57%) had a close relative with breast, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer. Of the 47 subjects with available DNA, 10 (21%) were found to carry a deleterious inherited mutation in BRCA1 (3 subjects; 6%), BRCA2 (2 subjects; 4%), TP53 (tumor protein p53) (3 subjects; 6%), CHEK2 (checkpoint kinase 2) (1 subject; 2%), and PALB2 (partner and localizer of BRCA2) (1 subject; 2%). CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of BC with TRL have personal and family histories suggestive of inherited cancer susceptibility and frequently carry germline mutations in BC susceptibility genes. The data from the current study support the role of these genes in TRL risk and suggest that long-term follow-up studies of women with germline mutations who are treated for BC and functional studies of the effects of heterozygous mutations in these genes on bone marrow function after cytotoxic exposures are warranted.

METHODS: From October 2008 to February 2015, we established a hospital-based cohort of ovarian cancer patients and the germline status of all 218 women with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer was tested using targeted amplification and sequencing of the intron-exon junctions and exonic sequences of BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 and TP53. RESULTS: BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were found in 8% (17 cases) and 3% (7 cases) of the ovarian cancer patients, respectively. Mutation carriers were diagnosed at a similar age to non-carriers, but were more likely to be Indian, have serous ovarian cancer, and have more relatives with breast or ovarian cancer. Nonetheless, 42% (10/24) of mutation carriers did not have any family history of breast or ovarian cancer and offering genetic counselling and genetic testing only to women with family history would mean that 35% (6/17) of BRCA1 mutation carriers and 57% (4/7) of BRCA2 mutation carriers would not be offered genetic testing. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that, similar to Caucasians, a significant proportion of Asian ovarian cancer was attributed to germline mutations in BRCA1 and to a lesser extent in BRCA2",

  "Title": "Allele-specific wild-type TP53 expression in the unaffected carrier parent of children with Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder where an oncogenic TP53 germline mutation is passed from parent to child. Tumor protein p53 is a key tumor suppressor regulating cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. Paradoxically, some mutant TP53 carriers remain unaffected, while their children develop cancer within the first few years of life. To address this paradox, response to UV stress was compared in dermal fibroblasts (dFb) from an affected LFS patient vs. their unaffected carrier parent. UV induction of CDKN1A/p21, a regulatory target of p53, in LFS patient dFb was significantly reduced compared to the unaffected parent. UV exposure also induced significantly greater p53[Ser15]-phosphorylation in LFS patient dFb, a reported property of some mutant p53 variants. Taken together, these results suggested that unaffected parental dFb may express an increased proportion of wild-type vs. mutant p53. Indeed, a significantly increased ratio of wild-type to mutant TP53 allele-specific expression in the unaffected parent dFb was confirmed by RT-PCR-RFLP and RNA-seq analysis. Hence, allele-specific expression of wild-type TP53 may allow an unaffected parent to mount a response to genotoxic stress more characteristic of homozygous wild-type TP53 individuals than their affected offspring, providing protection from the oncogenesis associated with LFS",

  "Title": "Male breast cancer in a multi-gene panel testing cohort: insights and unexpected results",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Genetic predisposition to male breast cancer (MBC) is not well understood. The aim of this study was to better define the predisposition genes contributing to MBC and the utility of germline multi-gene panel testing (MGPT) for explaining the etiology of MBCs. METHODS: Clinical histories and molecular results were retrospectively reviewed for 715 MBC patients who underwent MGPT from March 2012 to June 2016. RESULTS: The detection rate of MGPT was 18.1% for patients tested for variants in 16 breast cancer susceptibility genes and with no prior BRCA1/2 testing. BRCA2 and CHEK2 were the most frequently mutated genes (11.0 and 4.1% of patients with no prior BRCA1/2 testing, respectively). Pathogenic variants in BRCA2 [odds ratio (OR) \u003d 13.9; p \u003d 1.92 x 10(-16)], CHEK2 (OR \u003d 3.7; p \u003d 6.24 x 10(-24)), and PALB2 (OR \u003d 6.6, p \u003d 0.01) were associated with significantly increased risks of MBC. The average age at diagnosis of MBC was similar for patients with (64 years) and without (62 years) pathogenic variants. CHEK2 1100delC carriers had a significantly lower average age of diagnosis (n \u003d 7; 54 years) than all others with pathogenic variants (p \u003d 0.03). No significant differences were observed between history of additional primary cancers (non-breast) and family history of male breast cancer for patients with and without pathogenic variants. However, patients with pathogenic variants in BRCA2 were more likely to have a history of multiple primary breast cancers. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that all MBC patients regardless of age of diagnosis, history of multiple primary cancers, or family history of MBC should be offered MGPT",

  "Title": "Contribution of germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes to tumor etiology in young women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Although breast cancer in young women accounts for \u003c10% of diagnoses annually, tumors in young patients exhibit more aggressive characteristics and higher mortality rates. Determination of the frequency of germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes is needed to improve the understanding of breast cancer etiology in young women. METHODS: All female patients enrolled in the Clinical Breast Cancer Project between 2001 and 2015 and diagnosed with invasive breast cancer before age 40 were included in this study. Family history was classified using the NCCN Familial Risk Assessment guidelines. Targeted sequencing of 94 cancer predisposition genes was performed using peripheral blood DNA. Variants were detected using VariantStudio and classified using ClinVar. RESULTS: Seven percent (141/1980) of patients were young women and 44 had a significant family history. Sequencing was completed for 118 women with genomic DNA. Pathogenic mutations were present in 27 patients: BRCA1 (n \u003d 10), BRCA2 (n \u003d 12), TP53 (n \u003d 1), and CHEK2 (n \u003d 4). Mutations classified as pathogenic were also detected in APC (n \u003d 1) and MUTYH (n \u003d 2). Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were detected in an additional 17 patients in ten genes. DISCUSSION: Pathogenic mutations in high- and moderate-risk breast cancer genes were detected in 23% of young women with an additional 3% having pathogenic mutations in colon cancer predisposition genes. VUS were observed in 14% of women in genes such as ATM, BRCA2, CDH1, CHEK2, and PALB2. Identification of those non-genetic factors is critical to reduce the burden of breast cancer in this population",

  "Title": "Prevalence and spectrum of germline rare variants in BRCA1/2 and PALB2 among breast cancer cases in Sarawak, Malaysia",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To characterize the spectrum of germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 in population-based unselected breast cancer cases in an Asian population. METHODS: Germline DNA from 467 breast cancer patients in Sarawak General Hospital, Malaysia, where 93% of the breast cancer patients in Sarawak are treated, was sequenced for the entire coding region of BRCA1; BRCA2; PALB2; Exons 6, 7, and 8 of TP53; and Exons 7 and 8 of PTEN. Pathogenic variants included known pathogenic variants in ClinVar, loss of function variants, and variants that disrupt splice site. RESULTS: We found 27 pathogenic variants (11 BRCA1, 10 BRCA2, 4 PALB2, and 2 TP53) in 34 patients, which gave a prevalence of germline mutations of 2.8, 3.23, and 0.86% for BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2, respectively. Compared to mutation non-carriers, BRCA1 mutation carriers were more likely to have an earlier age at onset, triple-negative subtype, and lower body mass index, whereas BRCA2 mutation carriers were more likely to have a positive family history. Mutation carrier cases had worse survival compared to non-carriers; however, the association was mostly driven by stage and tumor subtype. We also identified 19 variants of unknown significance, and some of them were predicted to alter splicing or transcription factor binding sites. CONCLUSION: Our data provide insight into the genetics of breast cancer in this understudied group and suggest the need for modifying genetic testing guidelines for this population with a much younger age at diagnosis and more limited resources compared with Caucasian populations",

  "Title": "Genomic analysis of the origins and evolution of multicentric diffuse lower-grade gliomas",
  "Abstract": "Background: Rare multicentric lower-grade gliomas (LGG) represent a unique opportunity to study the heterogeneity between distinct tumor foci in a single patient, and to infer their origins and parallel patterns of evolution. Methods: In this study, we integrate clinical features, histology and immunohistochemistry for 4 patients with multicentric LGG, arising both synchronously and metachronously. For 3 patients we analyze the phylogeny of the lesions using exome sequencing, including one case with a total of 8 samples from the two lesions. Results: One patient was diagnosed with multicentric IDH1 mutated diffuse astrocytomas harboring distinct IDH1 mutations, R132H and R132C; the latter mutation has been associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which was subsequently confirmed in the patient\u0027s germline DNA and shown in additional cases with TCGA data. In another patient, phylogenetic analysis of synchronously arising grade II and grade III diffuse astrocytomas demonstrated a single shared mutation, IDH1 R132H, and revealed convergent evolution via non-overlapping mutations in ATRX and TP53. In 2 cases, there was divergent evolution of IDH1-mutated and chromosomes 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendroglioma and IDH1 mutated and 1p/19q intact diffuse astrocytoma, occurring synchronously in one case and metachronously in a second. Conclusions: Each tumor in multicentric LGG cases may arise independently or may diverge very early in their development, presenting as genetically and histologically distinct tumors. Comprehensive sampling of these lesions can therefore significantly alter diagnosis and management. Additionally, somatic IDH1 R132C mutation in either multicentric or solitary LGG identifies unsuspected germline TP53 mutation, validating the limited number of published cases",

  "Abstract": "Few susceptibility genes for gastric cancer have been identified. We sought to identify germline susceptibility genes from participants with gastric cancer from an international hereditary cancer research network. Adults with gastric cancer of any histology, and with a germline DNA sample (n \u003d 51), were retrospectively selected. For those without previously identified germline mutations (n \u003d 43), sequencing was performed for 706 candidate genes. Twenty pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified among 18 participants. Eight of the 18 participants had previous positive clinical testing, including six with CDH1 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, and two with pathogenic MSH2 and TP53 variants. Of the remaining 10, six were in BRCA1 DNA damage response pathway genes (ATM, ATR, BRCA2, BRIP1, FANCC, TP53), other variants were identified in CTNNA1, FLCN, SBDS, and GNAS. Participants identified with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were younger at gastric cancer diagnosis than those without, 39.1 versus 48.0 years, and over 50% had a close family member with gastric cancer (p-values \u003c 0.0001). In conclusion, many participants were identified with mutations in clinically-actionable genes. Age of onset and family history of gastric cancer were mutation status predictors. Our findings support multigene panels in identifying gastric cancer predisposition",

  "Title": "Germline Genetic Features of Young Individuals with Colorectal Cancer",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND \u0026 AIMS: The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in individuals younger than 50 years old is increasing. We sought to ascertain the proportion of young CRC cases associated with genetic predisposition. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of individuals diagnosed with CRC at an age younger than 50 years, evaluated by the clinical genetics service at a single tertiary care cancer center from 1998 through 2015. We collected data on patient histories, tumor phenotypes, and results of germline DNA sequencing. For subjects with uninformative clinical evaluations, germline DNA samples were (re)sequenced using a research-based next-generation sequencing multigene panel. The primary outcome was identification of a pathogenic germline mutation associated with cancer predisposition. RESULTS: Of 430 young CRC cases, 111 (26%) had a first-degree relative with CRC. Forty-one of the subjects with CRC (10%) had tumors with histologic evidence for mismatch repair deficiency. Of 315 subjects who underwent clinical germline sequencing, 79 had mutations associated with a hereditary cancer syndrome and 21 had variants of uncertain significance. Fifty-six subjects had pathogenic variants associated with Lynch syndrome (25 with mutations in MSH2, 24 with mutations in MLH1, 5 with mutations in MSH6, and 2 with mutations in PMS2) and 10 subjects had pathogenic variants associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. Thirteen subjects had mutations in other cancer-associated genes (8 in MUTYH, 2 in SMAD4, 1 in BRCA1, 1 in TP53, and 1 in CHEK2), all identified through multigene panel tests. Among 117 patients with uninformative clinical evaluations, next-generation sequence analysis using a multigene panel detected actionable germline variants in 6 patients (5%). Only 43 of the 85 subjects with germline mutations associated with a hereditary cancer syndrome (51%) reported a CRC diagnosis in a first-degree relative. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 1 in 5 individuals diagnosed with CRC at age younger than 50 years carries a germline mutation associated with cancer; nearly half of these do not have clinical histories typically associated with the identified syndrome. Germline testing with multigene cancer panels should be considered for all young patients with CRC",

  "Title": "Contribution of de novo and mosaic TP53 mutations to Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Development of tumours such as adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC), choroid plexus tumours (CPT) or female breast cancers before age 31 or multiple primary cancers belonging to the Li-Fraumeni (LFS) spectrum is, independently of the familial history, highly suggestive of a germline TP53 mutation. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of de novo and mosaic mutations to LFS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 328 unrelated patients harbouring a germline TP53 mutation identified by Sanger sequencing and/or QMPSF, we could show that the mutations had occurred de novo in 40 cases, without detectable parental age effect. Sanger sequencing revealed two mosaic mutations in a child with ACC and in an unaffected father of a child with medulloblastoma. Re-analysis of blood DNA by next-generation sequencing, performed at a depth above 500X, from 108 patients suggestive of LFS without detectable TP53 mutations, allowed us to identify 6 additional cases of mosaic TP53 mutations, in 2/49 children with ACC, 2/21 children with CPT, in 1/31 women with breast cancer before age 31 and in a patient who developed an osteosarcoma at age 12, a breast carcinoma and a breast sarcoma at age 35. CONCLUSIONS: This study performed on a large series of TP53 mutation carriers allows estimating the contribution to LFS of de novo mutations to at least 14% (48/336) and suggests that approximately one-fifth of these de novo mutations occur during embryonic development. Considering the medical impact of TP53 mutation identification, medical laboratories in charge of TP53 testing should ensure the detection of mosaic mutations",

  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome associated with germline pathogenic variants in TP53 gene. The phenotype may vary from classical to variant forms, known as Li-Fraumeni-like phenotypes. We searched for pathogenic variants in TP53 in a 14 year-old female diagnosed with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, a rare subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma. The proband is a heterozygote carrier of the TP53 c.467G\u003eA (p.Arg156His) in exon 5, and her mother is an asymptomatic carrier. Analysis of tumor DNA disclosed an additional somatic mutation in TP53, c.461G\u003eA; p.Gly154Asp. The TP53 germline and somatic pathogenic variants may have acted as possible driver mutations, resulting in genomic instability and tumor development. The fibrolamellar subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma may be part of the broad spectrum of tumors associated with Li-Fraumeni phenotype",

  "Abstract": "The increased availability of next generation sequencing (NGS) and multi gene panel testing has resulted in more frequent TP53 testing of families that do not meet classic testing criteria. We investigated testing criteria, family history and result outcome in a cohort of Irish probands undergoing TP53 full sequencing. All TP53 test requests processed through the national genetic testing laboratory between 2012 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Personal and family cancer histories were collected, including tumour type and age at diagnosis, from two adult cancer genetic services in Ireland. Association between Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or Li Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL) criteria and test result was examined. One hundred and 35 TP53 test requests were identified. Family history data and test results were available on 123 of the TP53 test requests (118 female; 5 male). 59/123 (48%) did not meet classic LFS or LFL criteria. Two individuals from this group harboured pathogenic TP53 mutations, giving a 3% mutation detection rate in those not meeting testing criteria. Both were female and had a personal history of early onset bilateral breast cancer with no reported LFS cancers in the family. 64/123 (52%) met LFS or LFL criteria and were all TP53 negative. 37/64 (57.8%) met Chompret criteria, 19/64 (29.7%) met Eeles and 7/64 (10.9%) met Eeles and Chompret and 1/64 (1.6%) met Classic LFS criteria. Stringent testing criteria miss germline mutations in TP53. Broadening the criteria for TP53 testing may improve our understanding of the phenotype and penetrance in the association syndrome",

  "Title": "Constitutional mosaicism of a de novo TP53 mutation in a patient with bilateral choroid plexus carcinoma",
  "Abstract": "Choroid plexus tumors (CPT) constitute 2%-5% of all pediatric brain tumors and include high grade choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC). About 40% of CPC patients harbor germline TP53 mutations, associated with diminished survival rates. However, the number of TP53 carriers might be underestimated due to suboptimal ability of Sanger sequencing to identify mosaicism. We describe an 18-month-old boy with ultra-rare, bilateral disseminated CPC and negative family history of cancer. Next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed constitutional mosaicism of de novo TP53 mutation, which was barely detectable by Sanger sequencing. This is the first description of a de novo TP53 mutation mosaicism in a patient with CPC. Up to now four cases of de novo TP53 mutations in CPC patients have been described but none of them were mosaic. Since TP53 mutation mosaicism may have an impact on management of patients and predisposition to other cancers, a reliable method of identification is important. Our results highlight the utility of high-throughput technologies in detection of potentially important genetic markers",

  "Abstract": "Importance: Germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 predispose to an increased lifetime risk of breast cancer. However, the relevance of germline variants in other genes from multigene hereditary cancer testing panels is not well defined. Objective: To determine the risks of breast cancer associated with germline variants in cancer predisposition genes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A study population of 65057 patients with breast cancer receiving germline genetic testing of cancer predisposition genes with hereditary cancer multigene panels. Associations between pathogenic variants in non-BRCA1 and non-BRCA2 predisposition genes and breast cancer risk were estimated in a case-control analysis of patients with breast cancer and Exome Aggregation Consortium reference controls. The women underwent testing between March 15, 2012, and June 30, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Breast cancer risk conferred by pathogenic variants in non-BRCA1 and non-BRCA2 predisposition genes. Results: The mean (SD) age at diagnosis for the 65 057 women included in the analysis was 48.5 (11.1) years. The frequency of pathogenic variants in 21 panel genes identified in 41611 consecutively tested white women with breast cancer was estimated at 10.2%. After exclusion of BRCA1, BRCA2, and syndromic breast cancer genes (CDH1, PTEN, and TP53), observed pathogenic variants in 5 of 16 genes were associated with high or moderately increased risks of breast cancer: ATM (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 2.22-3.62), BARD1 (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.31-3.63), CHEK2 (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.31-1.67), PALB2 (OR, 7.46; 95% CI, 5.12-11.19), and RAD51D (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.21-7.88). Conversely, variants in the BRIP1 and RAD51C ovarian cancer risk genes; the MRE11A, RAD50, and NBN MRN complex genes; the MLH1 and PMS2 mismatch repair genes; and NF1 were not associated with increased risks of breast cancer. Conclusions and Relevance: This study establishes several panel genes as high- and moderate-risk breast cancer genes and provides estimates of breast cancer risk associated with pathogenic variants in these genes among individuals qualifying for clinical genetic testing",

  "Title": "Autism spectrum disorder and Li-Fraumeni syndrome: purely coincidental or mechanistically associated?",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders with impaired social interactions and communication and restrictive, repetitive patterns of behaviors, interests, and activities. A recent epidemiological study suggests that children with ASD might have an increased cancer risk. CASE PRESENTATION: The 14.5-year-old boy, previously diagnosed with ASD, was referred with persistent bone pain. Diagnostic work-up confirmed diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); cytogenetic analysis revealed low hypodiploid karyotype with a mutation (c.733G\u003eA, p.Gly245Ser, rs28934575) in TP53 in the leukemic blasts. By Sanger sequencing, the presence of this mutation in the germline was subsequently confirmed and, thus, diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) was made. His family history was remarkable with two siblings with intellectual disability and a mother who has died of premenopausal breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes causing cancer susceptibility syndromes overlap with those involved in autism. This functional overlap between autism and cancer is novel and particularly compelling. The surprising coincidence of LFS and ASD in our patient raises the question whether this is purely coincidental or mechanistically associated",

  "Title": "Germline Mutations in Cancer Predisposition Genes are Frequent in Sporadic Sarcomas",
  "Abstract": "Associations of sarcoma with inherited cancer syndromes implicate genetic predisposition in sarcoma development. However, due to the apparently sporadic nature of sarcomas, little attention has been paid to the role genetic susceptibility in sporadic sarcoma. To address this, we performed targeted-genomic sequencing to investigate the prevalence of germline mutations in known cancer-associated genes within an Asian cohort of sporadic sarcoma patients younger than 50 years old. We observed 13.6% (n \u003d 9) amongst 66 patients harbour at least one predicted pathogenic germline mutation in 10 cancer-associated genes including ATM, BRCA2, ERCC4, FANCC, FANCE, FANCI, MSH6, POLE, SDHA and TP53. The most frequently affected genes are involved in the DNA damage repair pathway, with a germline mutation prevalence of 10.6%. Our findings suggests that genetic predisposition plays a larger role than expected in our Asian cohort of sporadic sarcoma, therefore clinicians should be aware of the possibility that young sarcoma patients may be carriers of inherited mutations in cancer genes and should be considered for genetic testing, regardless of family history. The prevalence of germline mutations in DNA damage repair genes imply that therapeutic strategies exploiting the vulnerabilities resulting from impaired DNA repair may be promising areas for translational research",

  "Title": "Increasing genomic instability during cancer therapy in a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Background: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a cancer predisposition disorder characterized by germline mutations of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene. In response to DNA damage, p53 stimulates protective cellular processes including cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis to prevent aberrant cell proliferation. Current cancer therapies involve agents that damage DNA, which also affect non-cancerous hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Here, we report on a child with LFS who developed genomic instability during craniospinal irradiation for metastatic choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC). Case presentation: This previously healthy 4-year-old boy presented with parieto-temporal brain tumor, diagnosed as CPC grade-3. Screening for cancer-predisposing syndrome revealed heterozygous p53 germline mutation, leading to LFS diagnosis. After tumour resection and systemic chemotherapy, entire craniospinal axis was irradiated due to leptomeningeal seeding, resulting in disease stabilization for nearly 12months. Blood lymphocytes of LFS patient (p53-deficient) and age-matched tumor-children (p53-proficient) were collected before, during and after craniospinal irradiation and compared with asymptomatic carriers for identical p53 mutation, not exposed to DNA-damaging treatment. In p53-deficient lymphocytes of LFS patient radiation-induced DNA damage failed to induce cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. Although DNA repair capacity was not impaired, p53-deficient blood lymphocytes of LFS patient showed significant accumulation of 53BP1-foci during and even several months after irradiation, reflecting persistent DNA damage. Electron microscopy revealed DNA abnormalities ranging from simple unrepaired lesions to chromosomal abnormalities. Metaphase spreads of p53-deficient lymphocytes explored by mFISH revealed high amounts of complex chromosomal aberrations after craniospinal irradiation. Conclusions: Tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in maintaining genomic stability by promoting cell-cycle checkpoints and apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that a patient with LFS receiving craniospinal irradiation including large volumes of bone marrow developed progressive genomic instability of the hematopoietic system. During DNA-damaging radiotherapy, genome-stabilizing mechanisms in proliferating stem/progenitor cells are perturbed by p53 deficiency, increasing the risk of cancer initiation and progression",

  "Title": "Molecular Guided Therapy Provides Sustained Clinical Response in Refractory Choroid Plexus Carcinoma",
  "Abstract": "Choroid plexus carcinomas (CPCs) are rare, aggressive pediatric brain tumors with no established curative therapy for relapsed disease, and poor survival rates. TP53 Mutation or dysfunction correlates with poor or no survival outcome in CPCs. Here, we report the case of a 4 month-old female who presented with disseminated CPC. After initial response to tumor resection and adjuvant-chemotherapy, the tumor recurred and metastasized with no response to aggressive relapse therapy suggesting genetic predisposition. This patient was then enrolled to a Molecular Guided Therapy Clinical Trial. Genomic profiling of patient tumor and normal sample identified a TP53 germline mutation with loss of heterozygosity, somatic mutations including IDH2, and aberrant activation of biological pathways. The mutations were not targetable for therapy. However, targeting the altered biological pathways (mTOR, PDGFRB, FGF2, HDAC) guided identification of possibly beneficial treatment with a combination of sirolimus, thalidomide, sunitinib, and vorinostat. This therapy led to 92% reduction in tumor size with no serious adverse events, excellent quality of life and long term survival",

  "Title": "Breast cancer in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome - a case-series study and review of literature",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare disease with autosomal dominant inheritance linked to germline mutations of tumor suppressor gene TP53. These patients are predisposed to malignancies such as sarcoma, breast cancer, leukemia, and other malignancies. Breast cancer, the most common malignancy in adult patients with LFS, has an early-onset presentation and is usually treated as per the guidelines for the general population due to the limited literature about breast cancer in LFS. We aimed to describe our institutional experience treating patients with breast cancer and LFS to contribute to literature about this entity. DESIGN: Retrospective single-institution case-series study. We searched for cases with LFS and breast cancer from 01/01/2000 to 12/31/2015 with treatment received at our institution. RESULTS: We identified 4 cases (2 African Americans, 1 Indian, and 1 Hispanic) in 4 different families, who were diagnosed with LFS after presenting with breast cancer. Three cases were triple-negative disease and 1 case was ER+, HER2 positive disease. They were treated with mastectomy and a third-generation breast chemotherapy regimen and/or trastuzumab-containing regimen. Radiation therapy was used in 2 patients. Breast cancer recurrence was seen in 1 patient, while three other malignancies were identified after breast cancer treatment (1 breast sarcoma, 1 leiomyosarcoma, and 1 myelodysplastic syndrome). A patient, who underwent surveillance with a positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan, was found to have a stage I leiomyosarcoma and was treated with surgical resection, but then developed metastatic disease requiring cytotoxic chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer among patients with LFS needs a multidisciplinary treatment approach. Surgical management follows the guidelines for the general population. Risk-benefit assessment of chemotherapy and radiotherapy needs to be performed carefully in a case-by-case approach. Patients should undergo multimodality cancer surveillance, preferably in the context of a clinical trial",

  "Title": "Next-generation sequencing in familial breast cancer patients from Lebanon",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Familial breast cancer (BC) represents 5 to 10% of all BC cases. Mutations in two high susceptibility BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes explain 16-40% of familial BC, while other high, moderate and low susceptibility genes explain up to 20% more of BC families. The Lebanese reported prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 deleterious mutations (5.6% and 12.5%) were lower than those reported in the literature. METHODS: In the presented study, 45 Lebanese patients with a reported family history of BC were tested using Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) technique followed by Sanger sequencing validation. RESULTS: Nineteen pathogenic mutations were identified in this study. These 19 mutations were found in 13 different genes such as: ABCC12, APC, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, ERCC6, MSH2, POLH, PRF1, SLX4, STK11 and TP53. CONCLUSIONS: In this first application of WES on BC in Lebanon, we detected six BRCA1 and BRCA2 deleterious mutations in seven patients, with a total prevalence of 15.5%, a figure that is lower than those reported in the Western literature. The p.C44F mutation in the BRCA1 gene appeared twice in this study, suggesting a founder effect. Importantly, the overall mutation prevalence was equal to 40%, justifying the urgent need to deploy WES for the identification of genetic variants responsible for familial BC in the Lebanese population",

  "Title": "The frequency of cancer predisposition gene mutations in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer patients in Taiwan: From BRCA1/2 to multi-gene panels",
  "Abstract": "An important role of genetic factors in the development of breast cancer (BC) or ovarian cancer (OC) in Taiwanese (ethnic Chinese) patients has been suggested. However, other than germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, which are related to hereditary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC), cancer-predisposition genes have not been well studied in this population. The aim of the present study was to more accurately summarize the prevalence of genetic mutations in HBOC patients using various gene panels ranging in size from BRCA1/2 alone to multi-gene panels. Among 272 HBOC patients analyzed, the prevalence of BRCA1, BRCA2 and non-BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations was 7.7% (21/272), 6.8% (16/236) and 8.2% (13/159), respectively. The total mutation rate was 18.4% (50/272). Although no founder mutations were identified in this study, two recurrent mutations, BRCA1 (c.3607C\u003eT) and BRCA2 (c.5164_5165 delAG), were found. The main pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations in non-BRCA1/2 genes included ATM, BRIP1, FANCI, MSH2, MUYTH, RAD50, RAD51C and TP53. The prevalence rate of gene mutations in HBOC patients did not differ with respect to whether BC or OC was the first diagnosis or they presented a family history of the disease or their age at diagnosis. HBOC patients with both BC and OC exhibited a higher prevalence rate of mutations (50.0%) than patients with OC (25.0%) or BC (8.6%) alone. In conclusion, evaluation of hereditary cancer risk in Taiwan HBOC patients, particularly individuals with double cancer, is strongly encouraged. Panel testing can yield additional genomic information, and widespread and well-designed panel testing will help in assessing more accurate mutational prevalence of risk genes",

  "Title": "Prevalence of deleterious germline variants in risk genes including BRCA1/2 in consecutive ovarian cancer patients (AGO-TR-1)",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Identification of families at risk for ovarian cancer offers the opportunity to consider prophylactic surgery thus reducing ovarian cancer mortality. So far, identification of potentially affected families in Germany was solely performed via family history and numbers of affected family members with breast or ovarian cancer. However, neither the prevalence of deleterious variants in BRCA1/2 in ovarian cancer in Germany nor the reliability of family history as trigger for genetic counselling has ever been evaluated. METHODS: Prospective counseling and germline testing of consecutive patients with primary diagnosis or with platinum-sensitive relapse of an invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. Testing included 25 candidate and established risk genes. Among these 25 genes, 16 genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, NBN, PMS2, PTEN, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, STK11, TP53) were defined as established cancer risk genes. A positive family history was defined as at least one relative with breast cancer or ovarian cancer or breast cancer in personal history. RESULTS: In total, we analyzed 523 patients: 281 patients with primary diagnosis of ovarian cancer and 242 patients with relapsed disease. Median age at primary diagnosis was 58 years (range 16-93) and 406 patients (77.6%) had a high-grade serous ovarian cancer. In total, 27.9% of the patients showed at least one deleterious variant in all 25 investigated genes and 26.4% in the defined 16 risk genes. Deleterious variants were most prevalent in the BRCA1 (15.5%), BRCA2 (5.5%), RAD51C (2.5%) and PALB2 (1.1%) genes. The prevalence of deleterious variants did not differ significantly between patients at primary diagnosis and relapse. The prevalence of deleterious variants in BRCA1/2 (and in all 16 risk genes) in patients \u003c60 years was 30.2% (33.2%) versus 10.6% (18.9%) in patients \u003e/\u003d60 years. Family history was positive in 43% of all patients. Patients with a positive family history had a prevalence of deleterious variants of 31.6% (36.0%) versus 11.4% (17.6%) and histologic subtype of high grade serous ovarian cancer versus other showed a prevalence of deleterious variants of 23.2% (29.1%) and 10.2% (14.8%), respectively. Testing only for BRCA1/2 would miss in our series more than 5% of the patients with a deleterious variant in established risk genes. CONCLUSIONS: 26.4% of all patients harbor at least one deleterious variant in established risk genes. The threshold of 10% mutation rate which is accepted for reimbursement by health care providers in Germany was observed in all subgroups analyzed and neither age at primary diagnosis nor histo-type or family history sufficiently enough could identify a subgroup not eligible for genetic counselling and testing. Genetic testing should therefore be offered to every patient with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer and limiting testing to BRCA1/2 seems to be not sufficient",

  "Title": "Recurrent TP53 missense mutation in cancer patients of Arab descent",
  "Abstract": "Hereditary cancer comprises more than 10% of all breast cancer cases. Identification of germinal mutations enables the initiation of a preventive program that can include early detection or preventive treatment and may also have a major impact on cancer therapy. Several recurrent mutations were identified in the BRCA1/2 genes in Jewish populations however, in other ethnic groups in Israel, no recurrent mutations were identified to date. Our group established panel sequencing in cancer patients to identify recurrent, founder, and new mutations in the heterogeneous and diverse populations in Israel, We evaluated five breast cancer patients of Arab descent diagnosed with cancer before the age of 50 years and identified the previously described TP53 mutation, c.541C\u003eT, R181C (rs587782596), in two women from unrelated Arab families. The two probands were diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age (27 and 34 years) and had significant family history spanning a wide range of tumors (breast cancer (BC), papillary thyroid cancer, glioblastoma multiform (GBM), colon cancer and leukemia). The R181C variant is expected to disrupt p53 at the ASPP2 binding domain but not the DNA binding domain and is defined by Clinvar as likely pathogenic and in HGMD as disease mutation. We further tested 85 unrelated Arab cancer patients and father of a BC carrier patient for TP53 c.541C\u003eT using a real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach and identified four additional carriers, two with BC one with lung cancer, and the father of a BC carrier patient, diagnosed with GBM. Another carrier suffering from BC was identified using a Myriad panel, suggesting a recurrent mutation in this population with a frequency of 5/42 (11.9%) of our selected BC patients. We suggest testing Arab women with a breast cancer at a young age, Arab patients with multiple malignancies, or with suggestive family history for TP53 c.541C\u003eT",

  "Title": "A novel TP53 germline inframe deletion identified in a Spanish series of Li-fraumeni syndrome suspected families",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant, inherited tumor predisposition syndrome associated with heterozygous germline mutations in the TP53 gene. The molecular diagnosis of LFS is important to develop strategies for early detection and access to the genetic counseling. Our study evaluated germline TP53 mutations in Spanish families with a history suggestive of LFS. Germline TP53 alterations in 22 families with a history suggestive of LFS were evaluated by Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Loss of heterozygosity analysis and immunohistochemistry of the protein in the tumor were performed in order to evaluate the pathogenicity of a novel alteration detected. A total of seven TP53 mutations were detected, six point mutations (4 missense and 2 nonsense) and a novel inframe deletion. 93% of mutation carriers developed at least one malignancy (mainly breast cancer and sarcomas), with a mean age at diagnosis of the first tumor of 30.2 years. Two missense mutations acted as dominant-negative. The novel inframe mutation c.437_445del was located in the DNA-binding domain. This mutation segregated with cancer in the family, and both high expression of the protein and loss of the wild-type TP53 allele were detected in the tumor of the carrier. We have found a novel inframe deletion in TP53 that likely results in the loss of p53 function and acts in a non-dominant negative way, although further studies are necessary to clarify this issue. The identification of novel TP53 alterations is crucial for a personalized cancer-risk management of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome",

  "Title": "TP53 and CDKN1A mutation analysis in families with Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni like syndromes",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni like syndromes (LFS/LFL) represent rare cancer-prone conditions associated mostly with sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, and adrenocortical carcinomas. TP53 germline mutations are present in up to 80 % of families with classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and in 20-60 % of families with Li-Fraumeni like phenotypes. The frequency of LFS/LFL families with no TP53 mutations detected suggests the involvement of other genes in the syndrome. In this study, we searched for mutations in TP53 in 39 probands from families with criteria for LFS/LFL. We also searched for mutations in the gene encoding the main mediator of p53 in cell cycle arrest, CDKN1A/p21, in all patients with no mutations in TP53. Eight probands carried germline disease-causing mutations in TP53: six missense mutations and two partial gene deletions. No mutations in CDKN1A coding region were detected. TP53 partial deletions in our cohort represented 25 % (2/8) of the mutations found, a much higher frequency than usually reported, emphasizing the need to search for TP53 rearrangements in patients with LFS/LFL phenotypes. Two benign tumors were detected in two TP53 mutation carriers: an adrenocortical adenoma and a neurofibroma, which raises a question about the possible implication of TP53 mutations on the development of such lesions",

  "Title": "Baseline results from the UK SIGNIFY study: a whole-body MRI screening study in TP53 mutation carriers and matched controls",
  "Abstract": "In the United Kingdom, current screening guidelines for TP53 germline mutation carriers solely recommends annual breast MRI, despite the wide spectrum of malignancies typically seen in this group. This study sought to investigate the role of one-off non-contrast whole-body MRI (WB MRI) in the screening of asymptomatic TP53 mutation carriers. 44 TP53 mutation carriers and 44 population controls were recruited. Scans were read by radiologists blinded to participant carrier status. The incidence of malignancies diagnosed in TP53 mutation carriers against general population controls was calculated. The incidences of non-malignant relevant disease and irrelevant disease were measured, as well as the number of investigations required to determine relevance of findings. In TP53 mutation carriers, 6 of 44 (13.6, 95% CI 5.2-27.4%) participants were diagnosed with cancer during the study, all of which would be considered life threatening if untreated. Two were found to have two primary cancers. Two participants with cancer had abnormalities on the MRI which were initially thought to be benign (a pericardial cyst and a uterine fibroid) but transpired to be sarcomas. No controls were diagnosed with cancer. Fifteen carriers (34.1, 95% CI 20.5-49.9%) and seven controls (15.9, 95% CI 6.7-30.1%) underwent further investigations following the WB MRI for abnormalities that transpired to be benign (p \u003d 0.049). The cancer detection rate in this group justifies a minimum baseline non-contrast WB MRI in germline TP53 mutation carriers. This should be adopted into national guidelines for management of adult TP53 mutation carriers in addition to the current practice of contrast enhanced breast MRI imaging",

  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome, with the characteristics of early onset of cancer and high cancer incidence. TP53 is widely accepted as a pathogenic gene of LFS. A 2 years and 6 months old boy is reported in this article, who was diagnosed with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in the left submandibular region. His brother died of RMS, and his grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer. TP53 gene mutation detection was performed in this patient and some family members, indicating a missense mutation in exon 8 of the patient: c.844C\u003eT (p.Arg282Trp, heterozygous). TP53 mutation was also found in his mother and sister. The boy met the diagnostic criteria for LFS. Among pediatric patients, the most common LFS diseases include osteosarcoma, adrenocortical cancer, central nervous system tumor, and soft tissue tumor. Additionally, leukemia and lymphoma are also involved. LFS patients have a high risk to suffer secondary or even multiple cancers. Therefore, it is necessary to perform genetic detection for pediatric cancer patients, especially those with hereditary predisposition cancers. TP53 mutation often indicates poor prognosis, so it is important to take active treatment and systematic monitoring for LFS family",

  "Title": "Germline Mutations in Cancer Susceptibility Genes in a Large Series of Unselected Breast Cancer Patients",
  "Abstract": "Purpose: The prevalence of mutations in cancer susceptibility genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 and other cancer susceptibility genes and their clinical relevance are largely unknown among a large series of unselected breast cancer patients in the Chinese population.Experimental Design: A total of 8,085 consecutive unselected Chinese breast cancer patients were enrolled. Germline mutations in 46 cancer susceptibility genes were detected using a 62-gene panel.Results: Pathogenic mutations were identified in 9.2% of patients among the 8,085 unselected breast cancer patients. Of these, 5.3% of patients carried a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (1.8% in BRCA1 and 3.5% in BRCA2), 2.9% carried other breast cancer susceptibility genes (BOCG) and 1.0% carried another cancer susceptibility genes. Triple-negative breast cancers had the highest prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations (11.2%) and other BOCG mutations (3.8%) among the four molecular subgroups, whereas ER(-)/PR(-)HER2(+) breast cancers had the lowest mutations in BRCA1/2 (1.8%) and BOCG (1.6%). In addition, BRCA1 mutation carriers had a significant worse disease-free survival [unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-2.34; P \u003d 0.014] and disease-specific survival (unadjusted HR 1.96; 95% CI, 1.03-3.65; P \u003d 0.040) than did non-carriers, whereas no significant difference in survival was found between BRCA2 mutation carriers and non-carriers.Conclusions: 9.2% of breast cancer patients carry a pathogenic mutation in cancer susceptibility genes in this large unselected series. Triple-negative breast cancers have the highest prevalence of mutations in BRCA1 /2 and other breast cancer susceptibility genes among the four molecular subgroups, whereas ER(-)/PR(-)HER2(+) breast cancers had the lowest mutations in these genes.

  "Title": "Somatic and Germline TP53 Alterations in Second Malignant Neoplasms from Pediatric Cancer Survivors",
  "Abstract": "Purpose: Second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) are severe late complications that occur in pediatric cancer survivors exposed to radiotherapy and other genotoxic treatments. To characterize the mutational landscape of treatment-induced sarcomas and to identify candidate SMN-predisposing variants, we analyzed germline and SMN samples from pediatric cancer survivors.Experimental Design: We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing on radiation-induced sarcomas arising from two pediatric cancer survivors. To assess the frequency of germline TP53 variants in SMNs, Sanger sequencing was performed to analyze germline TP53 in 37 pediatric cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) without any history of a familial cancer predisposition syndrome but known to have developed SMNs.Results: WES revealed TP53 mutations involving p53\u0027s DNA-binding domain in both index cases, one of which was also present in the germline. The germline and somatic TP53-mutant variants were enriched in the transcriptomes for both sarcomas. Analysis of TP53-coding exons in germline specimens from the CCSS survivor cohort identified a G215C variant encoding an R72P amino acid substitution in 6 patients and a synonymous SNP A639G in 4 others, resulting in 10 of 37 evaluable patients (27%) harboring a germline TP53 variant.Conclusions: Currently, germline TP53 is not routinely assessed in patients with pediatric cancer. These data support the concept that identifying germline TP53 variants at the time a primary cancer is diagnosed may identify patients at high risk for SMN development, who could benefit from modified therapeutic strategies and/or intensive posttreatment monitoring.

  "Title": "Deleterious Germline Mutations in Patients With Apparently Sporadic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma",
  "Abstract": "Purpose Deleterious germline mutations contribute to pancreatic cancer susceptibility and are well documented in families in which multiple members have had pancreatic cancer. Methods To define the prevalence of these germline mutations in patients with apparently sporadic pancreatic cancer, we sequenced 32 genes, including known pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes, in DNA prepared from normal tissue obtained from 854 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 288 patients with other pancreatic and periampullary neoplasms, and 51 patients with non-neoplastic diseases who underwent pancreatic resection at Johns Hopkins Hospital between 2000 and 2015. Results Thirty-three (3.9%; 95% CI, 3.0% to 5.8%) of 854 patients with pancreatic cancer had a deleterious germline mutation, 31 (3.5%) of which affected known familial pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes: BRCA2 (12 patients), ATM (10 patients), BRCA1 (3 patients), PALB2 (2 patients), MLH1 (2 patients), CDKN2A (1 patient), and TP53 (1 patient). Patients with these germline mutations were younger than those without (mean +/- SD, 60.8 +/- 10.6 v 65.1 +/- 10.5 years; P \u003d .03). Deleterious germline mutations were also found in BUB1B (1) and BUB3 (1). Only three of these 33 patients had reported a family history of pancreatic cancer, and most did not have a cancer family history to suggest an inherited cancer syndrome. Five (1.7%) of 288 patients with other periampullary neoplasms also had a deleterious germline mutation. Conclusion Germline mutations in pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes are commonly identified in patients with pancreatic cancer without a significant family history of cancer. These deleterious pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene mutations, some of which are therapeutically targetable, will be missed if current family history guidelines are the main criteria used to determine the appropriateness of gene testing",

  "Title": "Association of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome With Small Cell Carcinoma of the Ovary, Hypercalcemic Type and Concurrent Pleomorphic Liposarcoma of the Cervix",
  "Abstract": "Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT), is a rare, highly lethal malignancy predominantly affecting young adult females. We report a patient with widely metastatic SCCOHT and concurrent uterine cervical pleomorphic liposarcoma. Clinical targeted next-generation sequencing was performed on both neoplasms and demonstrated hemizygous stop-gain TP53 mutations (p.R196*), and wild-type SMARCA4 in both tumors. Microarray analyses of both tumors revealed similar but not identical widespread loss of heterozygosity over most chromosomes associated with loss of chromosomal copy number in the SCCOHT and pleomorphic liposarcoma tumors, amplification of FGFR1 in both tumors, and amplification of MYC in the SCCOHT. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that SMARCA4 and SMARCB1 were retained in both tumors, and that SMARCA2 expression was retained but TP53 expression was lost in the SCCOHT. Germline testing using Sanger sequencing showed heterozygous TP53 mutation, confirming the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. These findings are novel and for the first time associate SCCOHT with Li-Fraumeni syndrome",

  "Title": "Spectrum of germline mutations in smokers and non-smokers in Brazilian non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients",
  "Abstract": "Lung cancer (LC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Although smoking is the major risk factor, ~15% of all cases occur in never-smokers, suggesting that genetic factors play a role in LC predisposition. Indeed, germline mutations in the TP53 gene predispose to multiple cancer types, including LC. To date, few studies compared the somatic and germline mutational profiles of LC cases by smoking status, and none was reported in Brazilians. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on two pools (seven smokers and six non-smokers) of tumor-derived DNA using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. Files from pools were analyzed separately using Ingenuity(R)Variant AnalysisTM and Mendel,MD. Validation of all candidate variants was performed by Sanger sequencing. Subsequently, validated mutations were analyzed in germline DNA from the same patients and in ethnically matched controls. In addition, a single recurring Brazilian TP53 germline mutation (R337H) was genotyped in 45 non-small-cell lung cancer patients.Four novel germline variants in the ATAD2, AURKA, PTPRD and THBS1 genes were identified exclusively in smoker patients, and four germline missense variants in PLCD1, RAD52, CP and CDC6 genes were identified solely in non-smokers. There were 4/45 (8.9%) germline carriers of the R337H TP53 mutation. In conclusion, the recurring Brazilian TP53 mutation should be genotyped in all non-small-cell lung cancer in Brazil, regardless of smoking status. Distinct pathogenic mutations and novel sequence variants are detected in Brazilian non-small-cell lung cancer patients, by smoking status. The contribution of these sequence variants to LC pathogenesis remains to be further explored",

  "Title": "Whole-exome analysis of a Li-Fraumeni family trio with a novel TP53 PRD mutation and anticipation profile",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a clinically heterogeneous familial cancer predisposition syndrome with autosomal-dominant inheritance caused by heterozygous germline mutations in the TP53 gene. We here analyze the genetic background of a family with a 4-year-proband presented with a Li-Fraumeni tumor. The mother developed breast cancer at age 37 and the proband died at age 8. We performed Sanger sequencing and whole-exome sequencing on peripheral blood DNA from proband and relatives. Data analysis selected only high-quality score and depth reads, rare variants and protein impact involving missense, non-sense, frameshift and splice disrupt mutations. Disease implicated variants and predicted deleterious alterations were also chosen. TP53 genetic testing revealed a never reported TP53 deletion arose as de novo mutation in the mother and inherited by the proband. We then performed whole-exome analysis of the trio to uncover inherited variants from the father that potentially worsen the already altered genetic background in the proband. No pathogenic variants were inherited in autosomal recessive, de novo dominant or X-linked recessive manner. Comparing proband and father exome we detected 25 predicted deleterious variants including a nonsense mutation in ERCC3. Those inherited mutations are possible candidate modifiers linked to TP53, explaining the proband accelerated tumor onset compared to the mother and providing a possible explanation of the genetic anticipation event in this Li-Fraumeni family",

  "Title": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome presenting as mucosal melanoma: Case report and treatment considerations",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a familial cancer predisposition associated with a germline mutation in TP53. Patients with LFS are at risk of developing malignancies and require comprehensive screening. We describe an index case of LFS presenting with mucosal melanoma. METHODS: A 21-year-old woman presented with a left maxillary mucosal lesion and a left neck mass. Biopsies revealed metastatic mucosal melanoma, which is a pathology previously unreported in LFS families. Genetic testing revealed LFS, with a germline TP53 mutation, and pedigree analysis identified 9 first-degree and second-degree relatives with hematologic malignancies. RESULTS: The patient underwent a maxillectomy and left neck dissection, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. At 30-month follow-up, there was no evidence of local, regional, or distant failure, nor did she develop a second primary tumor. CONCLUSION: This represents the first reported case of LFS associated with mucosal melanoma. Treatment considerations, specifically the risks of adjuvant therapy in LFS, are discussed.

  "Title": "The Features of Colorectal Tumors in a Patient with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome",
  "Abstract": "A young woman with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) was referred to our hospital. On examination, multiple flat neoplasms were detected in addition to semi-pedunculated polyps. Restorative proctocolectomy was performed; one submucosal invasive cancer, two mucosal cancers, and several adenomas with high-grade dysplasia were detected. On immunohistochemical staining with p53, every part of all neoplasms, even the small adenomas, showed strong positive staining. Multiple flat neoplasms may be characteristic of patients with LFS and may have a much higher risk of rapid progression to invasive carcinomas than sporadic neoplasms. Thus, careful and frequent colonoscopy surveillance may be needed for patients with LFS",

  "Title": "A novel germline TP53 mutation p.Pro190Arg detected in a patient with lung and bilateral breast cancers",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare genetic disease with strong predispositions to multiple early-onset neoplasms, mostly sarcomas, breast cancers, brain tumors and adrenocortical carcinomas (LFS core cancers). In most LFS families the germline mutations of TP53 tumor suppressor gene were found. Lung cancer does not belong to the core cancers of LFS, however its higher incidence is observed in families with TP53 mutations. Our aim was to search for TP53 mutations in female lung cancer patients whose clinico-demographic characteristics suggested a probable genetic predisposition to the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The coding region of TP53 from blood DNA was sequenced using Sanger method. The functioning of detected mutation was tested by luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: We found a nucleotide substitution c.569C\u003eG, p.Pro190Arg, which was not described in the TP53 germline mutation database (http://p53.iarc.fr/TP53GermlineMutations.aspx). The mutation destroys the ability of p53 to transactivate BAX promoter and significantly reduces transactivation potential of p53 toward the promoter of MDM2 gen. CONCLUSION: We identified novel germline mutation of TP53",

  "Title": "Identification and Management of TP53 Gene Carriers Detected Through Multigene Panel Testing",
  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The increasing use of multigene panel tests may reveal an unexpected pathogenic variant in the tumor protein p53 (TP53) gene among individuals who do not meet clinical criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Among a registry-based sample of individuals with a pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variant in TP53, we sought to characterize the original clinical context in which genetic testing was performed, the personal and family history and whether they met clinical LFS criteria, and the follow-up care following diagnosis among those in whom this information was available. METHODS: Among individuals with multigene panel testing (inclusive of the TP53 gene) who were part of either the Inherited Cancer Registry or the Vanderbilt Hereditary Cancer Registry protocols and were confirmed to have a P/LP variant in TP53, pedigree was reviewed to characterize personal and family history, including original clinical context for genetic testing and whether they met clinical diagnostic criteria for TP53. Subsequent cancer risk management options were documented through information collected in the study questionnaire and medical records. RESULTS: Among the 10 participants enrolled in one of the two registries with a germline TP53 P/LP variant detected through a multigene panel test, the most frequent clinical contexts for testing were genetic risk recognized in the survivorship care setting (50%) and a newly diagnosed breast cancer (40%). No participants met classic LFS diagnostic criteria and 6 of 10 met Chompret criteria (60%) at the time of testing. Among the seven participants in whom results of total body magnetic resonance imaging were available, only three had completely negative findings. The remaining four had findings, three of which were likely benign/incidental requiring additional follow-up, and one was consistent with metastatic disease in the vertebrae. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that individuals identified with a germline P/LP variant in TP53 through multigene panel tests have substantial variations in clinical phenotypes not previously recognized when only those with striking family histories suggestive of LFS were tested through targeted TP53 testing. The expansion of the clinical phenotype among carriers of a P/LP in TP53 in the era of multigene testing should be considered when making cancer risk management recommendations, which were developed based on patients with classic LFS",

  "Title": "Genomic analysis of inherited breast cancer among Palestinian women: Genetic heterogeneity and a founder mutation in TP531",
  "Abstract": "Breast cancer among Palestinian women has lower incidence than in Europe or North America, yet is very frequently familial. We studied genetic causes of this familial clustering in a consecutive hospital-based series of 875 Palestinian patients with invasive breast cancer, including 453 women with diagnosis by age 40, or with breast or ovarian cancer in a mother, sister, grandmother or aunt (\u0027discovery series\u0027); and 422 women diagnosed after age 40 and with negative family history (\u0027older-onset sporadic patient series\u0027). Genomic DNA from women in the discovery series was sequenced for all known breast cancer genes, revealing a pathogenic mutation in 13% (61/453) of patients. These mutations were screened in all patients and in 300 Palestinian female controls, revealing 1.0% (4/422) carriers among older, nonfamilial patients and two carriers among controls. The mutational spectrum was highly heterogeneous, including pathogenic mutations in 11 different genes: BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, ATM, CHEK2, BARD1, BRIP1, PALB2, MRE11A, PTEN and XRCC2. BRCA1 carriers were significantly more likely than other patients to have triple negative tumors (p \u003d 0.03). The single most frequent mutation was TP53 p.R181C, which was significantly enriched in the discovery series compared to controls (p \u003d 0.01) and was responsible for 15% of breast cancers among young onset or familial patients. TP53 p.R181C predisposed specifically to breast cancer with incomplete penetrance, and not to other Li-Fraumeni cancers. Palestinian women with young onset or familial breast cancer and their families would benefit from genetic analysis and counseling",

  "Title": "Probable hereditary familial overlap syndrome with multiple synchronous lung tumors",
  "Abstract": "Here we report a case of a young, never-smoker Hispanic woman with a hereditary familial overlap syndrome (Li-Fraumeni plus CDH1). The patient developed multiple synchronous primary lung adenocarcinomas related to Intra-Alveolar Tumor Spread (STAS) several years after the diagnosis of a locally advanced lower limb osteosarcoma. Comprehensive genomic profiling by next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on 90 cancer-related genes over each lung lesion (including two nodules of acinar adenocarcinoma, one lepidic spread tumor and in the STAS area). Likewise, the broad genomic analysis was performed on archival tissue from the previous bone tumor. Lung tumors were found to harbor PIK3CA (invasive lesions) and a rare in-frame insertion of nucleotides in exon 19 of EGFR (lepidic tumor). STAS area showed KRAS and BRAF mutations in two different segments, and osteosarcoma tested positive for well known PIK3CA, KRAS and CDH1 alterations. This unique case raises practical questions as to the challenges of molecular testing and highlights the potential association of germline TP53 and CDH1 mutations with concurrent somatic alterations that elucidate the basis of tumor heterogeneity",

  "Title": "Screening of over 1000 Indian patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer with a multi-gene panel: prevalence of BRCA1/2 and non-BRCA mutations",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Breast and/or ovarian cancers are among the most common cancers in women across the world. In the Indian population, the healthcare burden of breast and/or ovarian cancers has been steadily rising, thus stressing the need for early detection, surveillance, and disease management measures. However, the burden attributable to inherited mutations is not well characterized. METHODS: We sequenced 1010 unrelated patients and families from across India with an indication of breast and/or ovarian cancers, using the TruSight Cancer panel which includes 14 genes, strongly associated with risk of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancers. Genetic variations were identified using the StrandNGS software and interpreted using the StrandOmics platform. RESULTS: We were able to detect mutations in 304 (30.1%) cases, of which, 56 mutations were novel. A majority (84.9%) of the mutations were detected in the BRCA1/2 genes as compared to non-BRCA genes (15.1%). When the cases were stratified on the basis of age at diagnosis and family history of cancer, the high rate of 75% of detection of hereditary variants was observed in patients whose age at diagnosis was below 40 years and had first-degree family member(s) affected by breast and/or ovarian cancers. Our findings indicate that in the Indian population, there is a high prevalence of mutations in the high-risk breast cancer genes: BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, and PALB2. CONCLUSION: In India, socioeconomic inequality limiting access to treatment is a major factor towards increased cancer burden; therefore, incorporation of a cost-effective and comprehensive multi-gene test will be helpful in ensuring widespread implementation of genetic screening in the clinical practice for hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancers",

  "Title": "High Yield of Pathogenic Germline Mutations Causative or Likely Causative of the Cancer Phenotype in Selected Children with Cancer",
  "Abstract": "Purpose: In many children with cancer and characteristics suggestive of a genetic predisposition syndrome, the genetic cause is still unknown. We studied the yield of pathogenic mutations by applying whole-exome sequencing on a selected cohort of children with cancer.Experimental Design: To identify mutations in known and novel cancer-predisposing genes, we performed trio-based whole-exome sequencing on germline DNA of 40 selected children and their parents. These children were diagnosed with cancer and had at least one of the following features: (1) intellectual disability and/or congenital anomalies, (2) multiple malignancies, (3) family history of cancer, or (4) an adult type of cancer. We first analyzed the sequence data for germline mutations in 146 known cancer-predisposing genes. If no causative mutation was found, the analysis was extended to the whole exome.Results: Four patients carried causative mutations in a known cancer-predisposing gene: TP53 and DICER1 (n \u003d 3). In another 4 patients, exome sequencing revealed mutations causing syndromes that might have contributed to the malignancy (EP300-based Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, ARID1A-based Coffin-Siris syndrome, ACTB-based Baraitser-Winter syndrome, and EZH2-based Weaver syndrome). In addition, we identified two genes, KDM3B and TYK2, which are possibly involved in genetic cancer predisposition.Conclusions: In our selected cohort of patients, pathogenic germline mutations causative or likely causative of the cancer phenotype were found in 8 patients, and two possible novel cancer-predisposing genes were identified. Therewith, our study shows the added value of sequencing beyond a cancer gene panel in selected patients, to recognize childhood cancer predisposition. Clin Cancer Res; 24(7); 1594-603.

  "Abstract": "We conducted the largest investigation of predisposition variants in cancer to date, discovering 853 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 8% of 10,389 cases from 33 cancer types. Twenty-one genes showed single or cross-cancer associations, including novel associations of SDHA in melanoma and PALB2 in stomach adenocarcinoma. The 659 predisposition variants and 18 additional large deletions in tumor suppressors, including ATM, BRCA1, and NF1, showed low gene expression and frequent (43%) loss of heterozygosity or biallelic two-hit events. We also discovered 33 such variants in oncogenes, including missenses in MET, RET, and PTPN11 associated with high gene expression. We nominated 47 additional predisposition variants from prioritized VUSs supported by multiple evidences involving case-control frequency, loss of heterozygosity, expression effect, and co-localization with mutations and modified residues. Our integrative approach links rare predisposition variants to functional consequences, informing future guidelines of variant classification and germline genetic testing in cancer",

  "Title": "Association Between Inherited Germline Mutations in Cancer Predisposition Genes and Risk of Pancreatic Cancer",
  "Abstract": "Importance: Individuals genetically predisposed to pancreatic cancer may benefit from early detection. Genes that predispose to pancreatic cancer and the risks of pancreatic cancer associated with mutations in these genes are not well defined. Objective: To determine whether inherited germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes are associated with increased risks of pancreatic cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case-control analysis to identify pancreatic cancer predisposition genes; longitudinal analysis of patients with pancreatic cancer for prognosis. The study included 3030 adults diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer and enrolled in a Mayo Clinic registry between October 12, 2000, and March 31, 2016, with last follow-up on June 22, 2017. Reference controls were 123136 individuals with exome sequence data in the public Genome Aggregation Database and 53105 in the Exome Aggregation Consortium database. Exposures: Individuals were classified based on carrying a deleterious mutation in cancer predisposition genes and having a personal or family history of cancer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Germline mutations in coding regions of 21 cancer predisposition genes were identified by sequencing of products from a custom multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based panel; associations of genes with pancreatic cancer were assessed by comparing frequency of mutations in genes of pancreatic cancer patients with those of reference controls. Results: Comparing 3030 case patients with pancreatic cancer (43.2% female; 95.6% non-Hispanic white; mean age at diagnosis, 65.3 [SD, 10.7] years) with reference controls, significant associations were observed between pancreatic cancer and mutations in CDKN2A (0.3% of cases and 0.02% of controls; odds ratio [OR], 12.33; 95% CI, 5.43-25.61); TP53 (0.2% of cases and 0.02% of controls; OR, 6.70; 95% CI, 2.52-14.95); MLH1 (0.13% of cases and 0.02% of controls; OR, 6.66; 95% CI, 1.94-17.53); BRCA2 (1.9% of cases and 0.3% of controls; OR, 6.20; 95% CI, 4.62-8.17); ATM (2.3% of cases and 0.37% of controls; OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 4.38-7.33); and BRCA1 (0.6% of cases and 0.2% of controls; OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.54-4.05). Conclusions and Relevance: In this case-control study, mutations in 6 genes associated with pancreatic cancer were found in 5.5% of all pancreatic cancer patients, including 7.9% of patients with a family history of pancreatic cancer and 5.2% of patients without a family history of pancreatic cancer.

  "Title": "Spectrum and prevalence of genetic predisposition in medulloblastoma: a retrospective genetic study and prospective validation in a clinical trial cohort",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Medulloblastoma is associated with rare hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes; however, consensus medulloblastoma predisposition genes have not been defined and screening guidelines for genetic counselling and testing for paediatric patients are not available. We aimed to assess and define these genes to provide evidence for future screening guidelines. METHODS: In this international, multicentre study, we analysed patients with medulloblastoma from retrospective cohorts (International Cancer Genome Consortium [ICGC] PedBrain, Medulloblastoma Advanced Genomics International Consortium [MAGIC], and the CEFALO series) and from prospective cohorts from four clinical studies (SJMB03, SJMB12, SJYC07, and I-HIT-MED). Whole-genome sequences and exome sequences from blood and tumour samples were analysed for rare damaging germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes. DNA methylation profiling was done to determine consensus molecular subgroups: WNT (MBWNT), SHH (MBSHH), group 3 (MBGroup3), and group 4 (MBGroup4). Medulloblastoma predisposition genes were predicted on the basis of rare variant burden tests against controls without a cancer diagnosis from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). Previously defined somatic mutational signatures were used to further classify medulloblastoma genomes into two groups, a clock-like group (signatures 1 and 5) and a homologous recombination repair deficiency-like group (signatures 3 and 8), and chromothripsis was investigated using previously established criteria. Progression-free survival and overall survival were modelled for patients with a genetic predisposition to medulloblastoma. FINDINGS: We included a total of 1022 patients with medulloblastoma from the retrospective cohorts (n\u003d673) and the four prospective studies (n\u003d349), from whom blood samples (n\u003d1022) and tumour samples (n\u003d800) were analysed for germline mutations in 110 cancer predisposition genes. In our rare variant burden analysis, we compared these against 53 105 sequenced controls from ExAC and identified APC, BRCA2, PALB2, PTCH1, SUFU, and TP53 as consensus medulloblastoma predisposition genes according to our rare variant burden analysis and estimated that germline mutations accounted for 6% of medulloblastoma diagnoses in the retrospective cohort. The prevalence of genetic predispositions differed between molecular subgroups in the retrospective cohort and was highest for patients in the MBSHH subgroup (20% in the retrospective cohort). These estimates were replicated in the prospective clinical cohort (germline mutations accounted for 5% of medulloblastoma diagnoses, with the highest prevalence [14%] in the MBSHH subgroup). Patients with germline APC mutations developed MBWNT and accounted for most (five [71%] of seven) cases of MBWNT that had no somatic CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations. Patients with germline mutations in SUFU and PTCH1 mostly developed infant MBSHH. Germline TP53 mutations presented only in childhood patients in the MBSHH subgroup and explained more than half (eight [57%] of 14) of all chromothripsis events in this subgroup. Germline mutations in PALB2 and BRCA2 were observed across the MBSHH, MBGroup3, and MBGroup4 molecular subgroups and were associated with mutational signatures typical of homologous recombination repair deficiency. In patients with a genetic predisposition to medulloblastoma, 5-year progression-free survival was 52% (95% CI 40-69) and 5-year overall survival was 65% (95% CI 52-81); these survival estimates differed significantly across patients with germline mutations in different medulloblastoma predisposition genes. INTERPRETATION: Genetic counselling and testing should be used as a standard-of-care procedure in patients with MBWNT and MBSHH because these patients have the highest prevalence of damaging germline mutations in known cancer predisposition genes.

  "Title": "Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Risk Genes Identified by Multigene Hereditary Cancer Panel Testing",
  "Abstract": "Background: Germline genetic testing with hereditary cancer gene panels can identify women at increased risk of breast cancer. However, those at increased risk of triple-negative (estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor-negative) breast cancer (TNBC) cannot be identified because predisposition genes for TNBC, other than BRCA1, have not been established. The aim of this study was to define the cancer panel genes associated with increased risk of TNBC. Methods: Multigene panel testing for 21 genes in 8753 TNBC patients was performed by a clinical testing laboratory, and testing for 17 genes in 2148 patients was conducted by a Triple Negative Breast Cancer Consortium (TNBCC) of research studies. Associations between deleterious mutations in cancer predisposition genes and TNBC were evaluated using results from TNBC patients and reference controls. Results: Germline pathogenic variants in BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and RAD51D were associated with high risk (odds ratio \u003e 5.0) of TNBC and greater than 20% lifetime risk for overall breast cancer among Caucasians. Pathogenic variants in BRIP1, RAD51C, and TP53 were associated with moderate risk (odds ratio \u003e 2) of TNBC. Similar trends were observed for the African American population. Pathogenic variants in these TNBC genes were detected in 12.0% (3.7% non-BRCA1/2) of all participants. Conclusions: Multigene hereditary cancer panel testing can identify women with elevated risk of TNBC due to mutations in BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and RAD51D. These women can potentially benefit from improved screening, risk management, and cancer prevention strategies. Patients with mutations may also benefit from specific targeted therapeutic strategies",

  "Title": "Differences in TP53 Mutation Carrier Phenotypes Emerge From Panel-Based Testing",
  "Abstract": "Background: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) has traditionally been identified by single-gene testing (SGT) of TP53 triggered by clinical criteria, but the widespread use of multigene panel tests (MGPTs) has upended this paradigm. We sought to compare the personal and family cancer histories of TP53-positive result (TP53+) carriers who were identified by either MGPT or SGT. Methods: Of 44 310 individuals who underwent testing of TP53 in a single clinical diagnostic laboratory between 2010 and 2014, 44 086 (40 885 MGPT and 3201 SGT) met study eligibility criteria. Personal cancer histories were available for 38 938 subjects. The frequency of germline TP53 results and various phenotypic manifestations were compared according to test type. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: MGPT TP53+ individuals (n \u003d 126) had an older median age at first cancer than SGT TP53+ carriers (n \u003d 96; women: median \u003d 36 vs 28 years, P \u003c .001; and men: median \u003d 40 vs 15 years, P \u003d .004). The median age of breast cancer diagnosis was 40 years in MGPT TP53+ women vs 33 years in SGT TP53+ women (P \u003c .001). In both cohorts, childhood and LFS core cancers, and for women, multiple primary cancers (not multiple breast tumors), were associated with TP53+ results. Established LFS testing criteria were less often met by MGPT TP53+ individuals. Conclusions: MGPT TP53+ individuals differ in phenotype from those ascertained through SGT and are notably older at cancer diagnosis and less likely to meet LFS clinical criteria. These findings suggest that LFS may have a greater phenotypic spectrum than previously appreciated. This has implications for the counseling of MGPT TP53+ individuals. Prospective follow-up of these individuals and families is needed to re-evaluate cancer risks",

  "Title": "New insights into the performance of multigene panel testing: Two novel nonsense variants in BRIP1 and TP53 in a young woman with breast cancer",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal-dominant disorder caused by germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene TP53. Here we report the case of a family whose index case was a woman diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer at the age of 18 and who had a non-informative result after BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing. After extending the study through multigene panel testing, two clinically relevant variants in the TP53 and BRIP1 genes, respectively, were found. Afterwards, the patient developed a glioblastoma. Both tumours were consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Thanks to the possibility of studying different genes related with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, it was possible to find out the gene variant that caused the early onset cancers in the patient. Furthermore, genetic counselling was provided to the index case and her family",

  "Title": "Mutation screening of TP53, CHEK2 and BRCA genes in patients at high risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) in Brazil",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies related to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) have been conducted in Brazil, and they are restricted to only small areas of the country. Here, we report the mutation profile of BRCA1/2, CHEK2 and TP53 genes in a cohort from Minas Gerais state. METHODS: These genes from 44 patients at high risk for HBOC were screened through high-resolution melting and/or sequencing. The pathogenicity of the alterations was checked using ClinVar database and bioinformatics programs. RESULTS: In BRCA genes we identified 46 variants, 38 without clinical significance and 8 pathogenic mutations including a new pathogenic mutation in BRCA1 gene (c.4688_4694delACCTGGAinsG). The most prevalent pathogenic mutation was c.4829_4830delTG, in the BRCA2 gene. This mutation was not described in the Brazilian population up to now and in this study, it was described with a prevalence of 6.8%. The p.R337H mutation in TP53 gene was found in one patient clinically diagnosed as HBOC and without clinical criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. In CHEK2 gene, the undescribed variant c.485A \u003e G was found and it presents as probably pathogenic through in silico analyses. Pathogenic mutations were found in 29.5% of the patients, 11.3% in BRCA1, 15.9% in BRCA2 and 2.3% in TP53 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Brazilian population is one of the most heterogeneous in the world and the mutational profile knowledge of genes related to HBOC from different regions can contribute to the definition of more cost-effective strategies for the prevention, identification and treatment of cancer",

  "Title": "Gestational choriocarcinoma associated with a germline TP53 mutation",
  "Abstract": "Choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant neoplasm resulting from the malignant transformation of proliferating trophoblastic cells and the molecular mechanisms leading to this transformation remain to be characterized. We report here the first case of a female germline TP53 mutation carrier who developed, as a first tumour, a lung choriocarcinoma, 6 months after a normal delivery. Molecular analyses established the gestational origin of the choriocarcinoma and showed, within the tumour, the presence of the germline mutant TP53 allele and loss of the wild-type allele. Resistance to methotrexate chemotherapy led to perform a surgical resection of the tumour. In agreement with the permissive role of TP53 mutations to oncogenic events, this report strongly suggests that TP53 mutations may promote malignant transformation of proliferating trophoblastic cells. Therefore, female TP53 mutation carriers may have an increased risk of developing gestational choriocarcinoma and might benefit from beta-hCG level monitoring after pregnancy",

  "Title": "Prognostic tumor sequencing panels frequently identify germ line variants associated with hereditary hematopoietic malignancies",
  "Abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based targeted gene capture panels are used to profile hematopoietic malignancies to guide prognostication and treatment decisions. Because these panels include genes associated with hereditary hematopoietic malignancies (HHMs), we hypothesized that these panels could identify pathogenic germ line variants in malignant cells, thereby identifying patients at risk for HHMs. In total, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in ANKRD26, CEBPA, DDX41, ETV6, GATA2, RUNX1, or TP53 were identified in 74 (21%) of 360 patients. Germ line tissue was available for 24 patients with 25 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants with variant allele frequencies \u003e0.4. Six (24%) of these 25 variants were of germ line origin. Three DDX41 variants, 2 GATA2 variants, and a TP53 variant previously implicated in Li-Fraumeni syndrome were of germ line origin. No likely pathogenic/pathogenic germ line variants possessed variant allele frequencies \u003c0.4. This study demonstrates that NGS-based prognostic panels may identify individuals at risk for HHMs despite not being designed for this purpose. Furthermore, variants known to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome as well as known pathogenic variants in genes such as DDX41 and GATA2 are especially likely to be of germ line origin. Thus, tumor-based panels may augment, but should not replace, comprehensive germ line-based testing and counseling",

  "Title": "Clinical relevance of screening checklists for detecting cancer predisposition syndromes in Asian childhood tumours",
  "Abstract": "Assessment of cancer predisposition syndromes (CPS) in childhood tumours is challenging to paediatric oncologists due to inconsistent recognizable clinical phenotypes and family histories, especially in cohorts with unknown prevalence of germline mutations. Screening checklists were developed to facilitate CPS detection in paediatric patients; however, their clinical value have yet been validated. Our study aims to assess the utility of clinical screening checklists validated by genetic sequencing in an Asian cohort of childhood tumours. We evaluated 102 patients under age 18 years recruited over a period of 31 months. Patient records were reviewed against two published checklists and germline mutations in 100 cancer-associated genes were profiled through a combination of whole-exome sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification on blood-derived genomic DNA. Pathogenic germline mutations were identified in ten (10%) patients across six known cancer predisposition genes: TP53, DICER1, NF1, FH, SDHD and VHL. Fifty-four (53%) patients screened positive on both checklists, including all ten pathogenic germline carriers. TP53 was most frequently mutated, affecting five children with adrenocortical carcinoma, sarcomas and diffuse astrocytoma. Disparity in prevalence of germline mutations across tumour types suggested variable genetic susceptibility and implied potential contribution of novel susceptibility genes. Only five (50%) children with pathogenic germline mutations had a family history of cancer. We conclude that CPS screening checklists are adequately sensitive to detect at-risk children and are relevant for clinical application. In addition, our study showed that 10% of Asian paediatric solid tumours have a heritable component, consistent with other populations",

  "Title": "Rare TP53 variant associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome exhibits variable penetrance in a Saudi family",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an inherited, autosomal-dominant condition that predisposes individuals to a wide-spectrum of tumors at an early age. Approximately 70% of families with classic LFS have pathogenic variants in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 that disrupt protein function or stability. While more than 70% of pathogenic variants in TP53 are missense variants, the vast majority occur very infrequently, and thus their clinical significance is uncertain or conflicting. Here, we report an extremely rare TP53 missense variant, c.799C \u003e T (p.Arg267Trp), identified in a 2-year-old Saudi proband diagnosed with choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) and six of his first- and second-degree relatives. CPC is frequently found in families with LFS, and this is the first detailed report of a family with this variant. Intriguingly, the proband\u0027s father is homozygous for TP53 c.799C \u003e T and phenotypically normal at 39 years of age. While loss of TP53 heterozygosity is often observed in tumors from individuals with LFS, homozygous germline TP53 pathogenic variants are rare. Based on our analysis of this single family, we hypothesize that TP53 c.799C \u003e T has low or variable penetrance for LFS, with predisposition to the development of CPC. The observations from this family have furthered our understanding of the phenotypic variability that may be caused by one variant of TP53, even in the same family, and suggest that other factors (genetic and/or environmental) may play a role in mechanism of disease manifestation in LFS",

  "Title": "Transmission of a TP53 germline mutation from unaffected male carrier associated with pediatric glioblastoma in his child and gestational choriocarcinoma in his female partner1",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germline alterations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 LFS is associated with numerous malignancies including astrocytoma. Sanger sequencing and chromosomal microarray studies of blood and tumor tissue from a 4-yr-old boy with glioblastoma demonstrated a germline TP53 mutation with loss of heterozygosity for the short arm of Chromosome 17 as the second inactivating event in the tumor. There was no family history of LFS, but the child\u0027s mother had recently died from metastatic choriocarcinoma after antecedent normal term delivery of a then 6-mo-old daughter. The choriocarcinoma contained the same TP53 mutation detected in the proband and the 6-mo-old daughter was confirmed to be a carrier. Unexpectedly, the germline TP53 mutation was found to be inherited from the unaffected father. We report here the second genetically confirmed case of TP53-mutated choriocarcinoma in the partner of an LFS patient. Based on this case and recent literature, female partners of LFS patients may have increased risk of choriocarcinoma due to transmission of germline TP53 mutation from male carriers. Although the Toronto protocol has established an effective approach to detect tumors and improve survival in children and adults with LFS, there is a need to expand the current criteria to include surveillance of female partners of LFS patients for choriocarcinoma and other gestational trophoblastic disease. Recognition of this unique mode of transmission of TP53 mutations should be considered in genetic counseling for cancer risk assessment and family planning",

  "Abstract": "The prevalence of germ line mutations in non-BRCA1/2 genes associated with hereditary breast cancer (BC) is low, and the role of some of these genes in BC predisposition and pathogenesis is conflicting. In this study, 5589 consecutive BC index patients negative for pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations and 2189 female controls were screened for germ line mutations in eight cancer predisposition genes (ATM, CDH1, CHEK2, NBN, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, and TP53). All patients met the inclusion criteria of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer for germ line testing. The highest mutation prevalence was observed in the CHEK2 gene (2.5%), followed by ATM (1.5%) and PALB2 (1.2%). The mutation prevalence in each of the remaining genes was 0.3% or lower. Using Exome Aggregation Consortium control data, we confirm significant associations of heterozygous germ line mutations with BC for ATM (OR: 3.63, 95%CI: 2.67-4.94), CDH1 (OR: 17.04, 95%CI: 3.54-82), CHEK2 (OR: 2.93, 95%CI: 2.29-3.75), PALB2 (OR: 9.53, 95%CI: 6.25-14.51), and TP53 (OR: 7.30, 95%CI: 1.22-43.68). NBN germ line mutations were not significantly associated with BC risk (OR:1.39, 95%CI: 0.73-2.64). Due to their low mutation prevalence, the RAD51C and RAD51D genes require further investigation. Compared with control datasets, predicted damaging rare missense variants were significantly more prevalent in CHEK2 and TP53 in BC index patients. Compared with the overall sample, only TP53 mutation carriers show a significantly younger age at first BC diagnosis. We demonstrate a significant association of deleterious variants in the CHEK2, PALB2, and TP53 genes with bilateral BC. Both, ATM and CHEK2, were negatively associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumor phenotypes. A particularly high CHEK2 mutation prevalence (5.2%) was observed in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive tumors",

  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), which is a rare dominantly inherited cancer predisposition syndrome, is associated with germline P53 mutations. Mutations of the tumor suppressor protein P53 are associated with more than 50% of human cancers; however, almost 30% of P53 mutations occur rarely and this has raised questions about their significance. It therefore appeared of particular interest that we identified a novel mutation in a patient suffering from breast cancer and fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of LFS. In this study, a patient with remarkable family history developed breast cancer and was diagnosed with LFS. By performing next-generation sequencing on the patient and subsequent verification by Sanger sequencing among other family members, a new germ-line P53 replication error, a trinucleotide repeat mutation in the coding region, was identified in two generations of this Li-Fraumeni family",

  "Title": "Identification and characterization of TP53 gene Allele Dropout in Li-Fraumeni syndrome and Oral cancer cohorts",
  "Abstract": "Allele Drop out (ADO) arising from non-amplification of one allele may produce false negative result and impact clinical management. In cancer, germline and somatic genetic analysis is being increasingly used but the prevalence, nature and implications of ADO has not been studied in any cohort. In a cohort of 290 Li Fraumeni/Li Fraumeni Like Syndrome cases undergoing TP53 genetic testing, of the 69 pathogenic mutations identified so far, 5 were initially missed and 4 were misgenotyped as homozygous mutation due to germline ADO. Of the 9 germline ADOs, 8 were sequence dependent, arising from a polymorphism (rs12951053) in the primer annealing region of exon 7. Of 35 somatic TP53 variants identified by exome sequencing in 50 oral cancer tissues registered under International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), as a result of ADO, 4 were not detectable and 6 were not called as variant on Sanger Sequencing due to low peak height. High prevalence of germline and somatic ADO in the most frequently mutated cancer gene TP53, highlights the need for systematic evaluation of ADO prevalence and causes in clinically important cancer genes. False negative result for high penetrance germline mutations or actionable somatic mutations in oncogenes could have major clinical implications",

  "Abstract": "We performed comprehensive molecular analysis of five cases of metastasizing uveal malignant melanoma (UM) (fresh-frozen samples) with an NGS panel of 73 genes. A likely pathogenic germline TP53 mutation c.760A \u003e G (p.I254V) was found in two tumor samples and matched nontumor tissue. In three cases, pathogenic BAP1 mutation was detected together with germline missense variants of uncertain significance in ATM. All cases carried recurrent activating GNAQ or GNA11 mutation. Moreover, we analyzed samples from another 16 patients with primary UM by direct Sanger sequencing focusing only on TP53 coding region. No other germline TP53 mutation was detected in these samples. Germline TP53 mutation, usually associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, is a rare event in UM. To the best of our knowledge, only one family with germline TP53 mutation has previously been described. In our study, we detected TP53 mutation in two patients without known family relationship. The identification of germline aberrations in TP53 or BAP1 is important to identify patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome or BAP1 cancer syndrome, which is also crucial for proper genetic counseling",

In addition we detected a recurrent copy number loss involving RPL5 as well as copy number amplifications involving TNFRSF11A [RANK] (in 2 cases), MYC, P2RX7, TMEM119 and PDGFRA. In summary, our comprehensive genomic characterisation of 11 cases of BIA-ALCL has provided insight into potential pathobiological mechanisms (JAK/STAT, MYC and TP53) as well as identifying targets for future therapeutic intervention (TNFRSF11A, PDGFRA) in this rare entity",

  "Title": "Clinical genetic testing outcome with multi-gene panel in Asian patients with multiple primary cancers",
  "Abstract": "Background: Developing multiple cancers is an indicator of underlying hereditary cancer predisposition, but there is a paucity of data regarding the clinical genetic testing outcomes of these patients. Methods: We compared cancer index patients with \u003e/\u003d2 primary malignancies versus 1 primary cancer who underwent clinical evaluation and testing with multi-gene panels comprising up to 49 genes from 1998-2016. Results: Among 1191 cancer index patients, 80.6%, 17.2%, and 2.2% respectively had 1, 2, and \u003e/\u003d3 primary malignancies. For patients with 2 primary cancers (n\u003d205), the most common cancer pairs were bilateral breast (37.5%), breast-ovary (11.7%), endometrium-ovary (9.2%), colon-endometrium (3.9%) and colon-colon (3.4%). 42.3% patients underwent gene testing including 110/231 (47.6%) with multiple malignancies. Pathogenic variants were found more frequently in younger patients, in those with a family history of cancer related to the suspected syndrome, and a trend towards significance in those with multiple primary cancers (35.5% vs. 25.6%, p \u003d 0.09). In patients with multiple cancers, pathogenic variants were most commonly identified in BRCA1 (38.5%), BRCA2 (17.9%), and the mismatch repair genes (20.5%), while 23.1% of pathogenic mutations were in other moderate- to high-penetrance cancer predisposition genes including APC, ATM, MUTYH, PALB2, RAD50 and TP53. Conclusion: Patients with multiple cancers were more likely to carry pathogenic mutations than those with single cancer. About three-quarters of deleterious mutations in patients with multiple primary cancers were in BRCA1/2 and the mismatch repair genes, but multi-gene panel testing facilitated the detection of mutations in another 6 genes and is warranted in this high-risk population",

  "Title": "Gene aberration profile of tumors of adolescent and young adult females",
  "Abstract": "There has been little improvement in the prognosis for adolescent and young adult (AYA) tumor patients. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand the etiology of tumor development and identify actionable gene aberrations to improve prevention and therapy. Here, 76 sporadic tumors (48 breast, 22 ovarian, and six uterine) from 76 AYA females (age range, 25-39 years) were subjected to whole exome and RNA sequencing to determine their mutational signatures and actionable gene profiles. Two individuals with breast cancer (4.2% of cases) and one with ovarian cancer (5.3% of cases) carried germline BRCA2 mutations. The two cases with breast tumors also each carried an additional deleterious germline mutation: one in TP53 and the other in CHEK2. Mutational signature analysis of the 76 tumors indicated that spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine and activity of the APOBEC cytidine deaminase protein family are major causes of mutagenesis. In addition, 18 breast or ovarian tumors (18/70, 26%), including the three cases with germline BRCA2 mutations, exhibited a predominant \u0027BRCAness\u0027 mutational signature, an indicator of functional BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency. Actionable aberrations and high tumor mutation burdens were detected in 24 breast (50%), 17 ovarian (77%), and five uterine (83%) tumor cases. Thus, mutational processes and aberrant genes in AYA tumors are largely shared with those identified in non-AYA tumors. The efficacy of molecular targeting and immune checkpoint inhibitory therapies should be explored for both AYA and non-AYA patients",

  "Title": "Surveillance Screening in Li-Fraumeni Syndrome: Raising Awareness of False Positives",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare cancer predisposition syndrome inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion that involves a germline mutation of tumor protein 53 (TP53). With the advent of more accessible and accurate genetic testing methods, along with more widespread knowledge of LFS, asymptomatic carriers can now be more easily identified. No general surveillance protocols were previously recommended other than routine physical exams and breast and colon cancer screening at younger ages, primarily due to questions involving efficacy, cost, and clinical benefits. With more data now available to support the implementation of a surveillance protocol for cancer predisposition syndromes such as LFS, preventative screening has become a national standard of care. However, as surveillance becomes more integrated into patient care, the benefits and risks must be further evaluated. We briefly describe our institutional experience with surveillance screening in LFS and describe two patients in depth where surveillance imaging brought to light false positives that led to increased utilization of resources and concern for new malignancy. Though the benefits of surveillance are clear, it is important to understand the potential for false positives involved with instituting this practice. Continued research of this topic is thus warranted, perhaps with larger prospective studies, to better capture the survival benefits of patients undergoing surveillance screening and more comprehensively understand the incidence of false positives",

  "Title": "Comprehensive Analysis of Germline Variants in Mexican Patients with Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Susceptibility",
  "Abstract": "Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) represents 5(-)10% of all patients with breast cancer and is associated with high-risk pathogenic alleles in BRCA1/2 genes, but only for 25% of cases. We aimed to find new pathogenic alleles in a panel of 143 cancer-predisposing genes in 300 Mexican cancer patients with suspicion of HBOC and 27 high-risk patients with a severe family history of cancer, using massive parallel sequencing. We found pathogenic variants in 23 genes, including BRCA1/2. In the group of cancer patients 15% (46/300) had a pathogenic variant; 11% (33/300) harbored variants with unknown clinical significance (VUS) and 74% (221/300) were negative. The high-risk group had 22% (6/27) of patients with pathogenic variants, 4% (1/27) had VUS and 74% (20/27) were negative. The most recurrent mutations were the Mexican founder deletion of exons 9-12 and the variant p.G228fs in BRCA1, each found in 5 of 17 patients with alterations in this gene. Rare VUS with potential impact at the protein level were found in 21 genes. Our results show for the first time in the Mexican population a higher contribution of pathogenic alleles in other susceptibility cancer genes (54%) than in BRCA1/2 (46%), highlighting the high locus heterogeneity of HBOC and the necessity of expanding genetic tests for this disease to include broader gene panels",

  "Title": "Novel genetic mutations detected by multigene panel are associated with hereditary colorectal cancer predisposition",
  "Abstract": "Half of the high-risk colorectal cancer families that fulfill the clinical criteria for Lynch syndrome lack germline mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes and remain unexplained. Genetic testing for hereditary cancers is rapidly evolving due to the introduction of multigene panels, which may identify more mutations than the old screening methods. The aim of this study is the use of a Next Generation Sequencing panel in order to find the genes involved in the cancer predisposition of these families. For this study, 98 patients from these unexplained families were tested with a multigene panel targeting 94 genes involved in cancer predisposition. The mutations found were validated by Sanger sequencing and the segregation was studied when possible. We identified 19 likely pathogenic variants in 18 patients. Out of these, 8 were found in MMR genes (5 in MLH1, 1 in MSH6 and 2 in PMS2). In addition, 11 mutations were detected in other genes, including high penetrance genes (APC, SMAD4 and TP53) and moderate penetrance genes (BRIP1, CHEK2, MUTYH, HNF1A and XPC). Mutations c.1194G\u003eA in SMAD4, c.714_720dup in PMS2, c.2050T\u003eG in MLH1 and c.1635_1636del in MSH6 were novel. In conclusion, the detection of new pathogenic mutations in high and moderate penetrance genes could contribute to the explanation of the heritability of colorectal cancer, changing the individual clinical management. Multigene panel testing is a more effective method to identify germline variants in cancer patients compared to single-gene approaches and should be therefore included in clinical laboratories",

  "Title": "Clinical characteristics and registry-validated extended pedigrees of germline TP53 mutation carriers in Denmark",
  "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: TP53 mutation carrier (Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, LFS) cohort studies often suffer from lack of extensive pedigree exploration. METHODS: We performed a nation-wide exploration of TP53 mutation carrier families identified through all clinical genetics departments in Denmark. Pedigrees were expanded and verified using unique national person identification, cancer, cause of death, pathology, and church registries. RESULTS: We identified 30 confirmed, six obligate and 14 assumed carriers in 15 families harboring 14 different mutations, including five novel and three de novo germline mutations. All but two (96%) developed cancer by age 54 years [mean debut age; 29.1 y., median 33.0 y., n \u003d 26 (17F, 9M), range 1-54 y]]. Cancer was the primary cause of all deaths [average age at death; 34.5 years]. Two tumors were identified through registry data alone. Two independent families harbored novel c.80delC mutations shown to be related through an ancestor born in 1907. This exhaustive national collection yielded markedly fewer TP53 mutation carriers than the 300-1,100 expected based on estimated background population frequencies. CONCLUSION: Germline TP53 mutations in Denmark are likely to be drastically underdiagnosed despite their severe phenotype. Following recent advances in surveillance options of LFS patients, lack of pre-symptomatic testing may lead to the mismanagement of some individuals",

  "Abstract": "Premenopausal breast cancer (BC) is a core tumor of Li-Fraumeni (LFS) and Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) Syndromes, predisposition disorders caused by germline mutations in TP53 gene. In the Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil, a specific TP53 germline mutation, c.1010G\u003eA (p.Arg337His), was identified at a population frequency of 0.3%, the highest value ever described for a TP53 germline variation. In Brazilian BC patients, carrier frequency can vary from 0.5% to 8.7%. The current study assessed carrier frequency by genotyping TP53 c.1010G\u003eA in 2 BC groups: 1) 315 patients unselected for age of diagnosis and family history (FH) and 2) 239 patients diagnosed before 46 years and without Chompret criteria for LFS or LFL. One carrier was identified in group 1 (0.3%; CI 95% 0.1-1.76%) and six carriers in group 2 (2.5%; CI 95% 0.93-5.39%). The frequencies differed significantly between groups (p \u003d 0.04). The mutation carrier frequency observed in group 2 could justify mutation testing in BC patients diagnosed before 46 years and without Chompret criteria for LFS or LFL. Further studies in larger samples of BC patients of different ages and regions of the country are necessary to provide more definitive TP53 p.Arg337His carrier frequencies in different scenarios",

  "Abstract": "Considering that mutations in known prostate cancer (PrCa) predisposition genes, including those responsible for hereditary breast/ovarian cancer and Lynch syndromes, explain less than 5% of early-onset/familial PrCa, we have sequenced 94 genes associated with cancer predisposition using next generation sequencing (NGS) in a series of 121 PrCa patients. We found monoallelic truncating/functionally deleterious mutations in seven genes, including ATM and CHEK2, which have previously been associated with PrCa predisposition, and five new candidate PrCa associated genes involved in cancer predisposing recessive disorders, namely RAD51C, FANCD2, FANCI, CEP57 and RECQL4. Furthermore, using in silico pathogenicity prediction of missense variants among 18 genes associated with breast/ovarian cancer and/or Lynch syndrome, followed by KASP genotyping in 710 healthy controls, we identified \u0027likely pathogenic\u0027 missense variants in ATM, BRIP1, CHEK2 and TP53. In conclusion, this study has identified putative PrCa predisposing germline mutations in 14.9% of early-onset/familial PrCa patients. Further data will be necessary to confirm the genetic heterogeneity of inherited PrCa predisposition hinted in this study",

  "Title": "The first two confirmed sub-Saharan African families with germline TP53 mutations causing Li-Fraumeni syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare inherited cancer syndrome characterised by the early onset of specific cancers. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is associated with germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene, TP53. This study reports the first cases of molecularly confirmed LFS germline mutations in sub-Saharan Africa. Three black African patients, all with LFS-associated cancers, were seen through the Clinical and Counselling Section of the Division of Human Genetics at the National Health Laboratory Service and University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, during 2011-2012. All three patients (two were related) were recruited into this research study. Sequence analysis of the coding region of the TP53 gene identified a Class IV (likely pathogenic) variant, c.326T \u003e C (p.Phe109Ser), in the two related patients, and a known pathogenic mutation, c.1010G \u003e A (p.Arg337His), also referred to as the Brazilian founder mutation, in the other patient. A confirmed diagnosis in these patients will assist in tailored medical management (it is recommended that individuals carrying a germline TP53 mutation avoid radiotherapy as this might cause secondary radiotherapy-induced malignancies) and in addition, genetic testing of at-risk family members can be offered. Very little is known and documented on LFS in African individuals. Despite the small number of patients in this study, the results support the need for diagnostic genetic testing for LFS in South Africa",

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: We evaluated the incidence and spectrum of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants of cancer susceptibility genes in BRCA1/2 mutation-negative Korean patients with a high risk for hereditary breast cancer using a comprehensive multigene panel that included 35 cancer susceptibility genes. METHODS: Samples from 120 patients who were negative for BRCA1/2 mutations, but had been diagnosed with breast cancer that was likely hereditary, were prospectively evaluated for the prevalence of high-penetrance and moderate-penetrance germline mutations. RESULTS: Nine patients (7.5%) had at least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant. Ten variants were identified in these patients: TP53 in two patients, PALB2 in three patients, BARD1 in two patients, BRIP1 in two patients, and MRE11A in one patient. We also identified 30 types of 139 variants of unknown significance (VUS). High-penetrance germline mutations, including TP53 and PALB2, tended to occur with high frequency in young (\u003c 35 years) breast cancer patients (4/19, 21.1%) than in those diagnosed with breast cancer at \u003e/\u003d35 years of age (1/101, 1.0%; p \u003d 0.003).

  "Title": "Germline breast cancer susceptibility gene mutations and breast cancer outcomes",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether germline breast cancer susceptibility gene mutations affect breast cancer related outcomes. We wanted to evaluate mutation patterns in 20 breast cancer susceptibility genes and correlate the mutations with clinical characteristics to determine the effects of these germline mutations on breast cancer prognosis. METHODS: The study cohort included 480 ethnic Chinese individuals in Taiwan with at least one of the six clinical risk factors for hereditary breast cancer: family history of breast or ovarian cancer, young age of onset for breast cancer, bilateral breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer, both breast and ovarian cancer, and male breast cancer. PCR-enriched amplicon-sequencing on a next generation sequencing platform was used to determine the germline DNA sequences of all exons and exon-flanking regions of the 20 genes. Protein-truncating variants were identified as pathogenic. RESULTS: We detected a 13.5% carrier rate of pathogenic germline mutations, with BRCA2 being the most prevalent and the non-BRCA genes accounting for 38.5% of the mutation carriers. BRCA mutation carriers were more likely to be diagnosed of breast cancer with lymph node involvement (66.7% vs 42.6%; P \u003d 0.011), and had significantly worse breast cancer specific outcomes. The 5-year disease-free survival was 73.3% for BRCA mutation carriers and 91.1% for non-carriers (hazard ratio for recurrence or death 2.42, 95% CI 1.29-4.53; P \u003d 0.013). After adjusting for clinical prognostic factors, BRCA mutation remained an independent poor prognostic factor for cancer recurrence or death (adjusted hazard ratio 3.04, 95% CI 1.40-6.58; P \u003d 0.005). Non-BRCA gene mutation carriers did not exhibit any significant difference in cancer characteristics or outcomes compared to those without detected mutations. Among the risk factors for hereditary breast cancer, the odds of detecting a germline mutation increased significantly with having bilateral breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio 3.27, 95% CI 1.64-6.51; P \u003d 0.0008) or having more than one risk factor (odds ratio 2.07, 95% CI 1.22-3.51; P \u003d 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Without prior knowledge of the mutation status, BRCA mutation carriers had more advanced breast cancer on initial diagnosis and worse cancer-related outcomes. Optimal approach to breast cancer treatment for BRCA mutation carriers warrants further investigation",

  "Title": "Addition of triple negativity of breast cancer as an indicator for germline mutations in predisposing genes increases sensitivity of clinical selection criteria",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. 12-15% of all tumors are triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). So far, TNBC has been mainly associated with mutations in BRCA1. The presence of other predisposing genes seems likely since DNA damage repair is a complex process that involves several genes. Therefore we investigated if mutations in other genes are involved in cancer development and whether TNBC is an additional indicator of mutational status besides family history and age of onset. METHODS: We performed a germline panel-based screening of 10 high and low-moderate penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CDH1, CHEK2, NBN, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D and TP53) in 229 consecutive individuals affected with TNBC unselected for age, family history or bilateral disease. Within this cohort we compared the number of mutation carriers fulfilling clinical selection criteria with the total number of carriers identified. RESULTS: Age at diagnosis ranged from 23 to 80 years with an average age of 50.2 years. In 57 women (24.9%) we detected a pathogenic mutation, with a higher frequency (29.7%) in the group manifesting cancer before 60 years. Deleterious BRCA1 mutations occurred in 14.8% of TNBC patients. These were predominantly recurrent frameshift mutations (24/34, 70.6%). Deleterious BRCA2 mutations occurred in 5.7% of patients, all but one (c.1813dupA) being unique. While no mutations were found in CDH1 and TP53, 10 mutations were detected in one of the six other predisposition genes. Remarkably, neither of the ATM, RAD51D, CHEK2 and PALB2 mutation carriers had a family history. Furthermore, patients with non-BRCA1/2 mutations were not significantly younger than mutation negative women (p \u003d 0.3341). Most importantly, among the 57 mutation carriers, ten (17.5%) would be missed using current clinical testing criteria including five (8%) with BRCA1/2 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our data confirm and expand previous studies of a high frequency of germline mutations in genes associated with ineffective repair of DNA damage in women with TNBCs. Neither age of onset, contralateral disease nor family history were able to discern all mutation positive individuals. Therefore, TNBC should be considered as an additional criterion for panel based genetic testing",

  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome characterized by pathogenic variants in the TP53 gene on chromosome 17. The most common cancers in Li-Fraumeni kindreds include sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, and adrenocortical carcinoma. We report a 9-month-old male who was diagnosed with an adrenocortical tumor and later found to harbor a novel TP53 c.559 G \u003e C germline variant, resulting in p.Gly187Arg. Family history included early-onset breast cancer in his paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandfather, as well as colon cancer at age 31 in a paternal cousin. The same TP53 variant was later confirmed in his paternal grandmother. Based on this information, his father (age 28, obligate carrier for the variant) was referred for colonoscopic screening and found to have multiple adenomatous polyps. This previously undescribed variant lies at an exon/intron boundary and is predicted to decrease splice site efficiency with resulting altered splicing or exon skipping. Our patient\u0027s family history provides limited evidence that this variant is a cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome",

  "Abstract": "The Li-Fraumeni cancer predisposition syndrome (LFS1) presents with a variety of tumor types and the TP53 gene is covered by most diagnostic cancer gene panels. We demonstrate that deleterious TP53 variants identified in blood-derived DNA of 523 patients with ovarian cancer (AGO-TR1 trial) were not causal for the patients\u0027 ovarian cancer in three out of six TP53-positive cases. In three out of six patients, deleterious TP53 mutations were identified with low variant fractions in blood-derived DNA but not in the tumor of the patient seeking advice. The analysis of the TP53 and PPM1D genes, both intimately involved in chemotherapy-induced and/or age-related clonal hematopoiesis (CH), in 523 patients and 1,053 age-matched female control individuals revealed that CH represents a frequent event following chemotherapy, affecting 26 of the 523 patients enrolled (5.0%). Considering that TP53 mutations may arise from chemotherapy-induced CH, our findings help to avoid false-positive genetic diagnoses of LFS1",

  "Abstract": "Germline mutations in TP53 are the primary cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Most mutations are reported within the DNA-binding domain. We report a case of a 15-year-old boy with LFS who developed early-stage nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, a rare subtype of Hodgkin lymphomas. His sister was diagnosed with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma at the age of 1.5 years. Sequence analysis revealed a germline mutation in the transactivation domain of TP53, c.145G\u003eC (p.D49H), in the patient, his sister, and father. One family with LFS with a germline TP53 D49H mutation has previously been reported. This report supports the pathogenicity of this mutation",

  "Title": "Clinicopathologic characterization of breast carcinomas in patients with non-BRCA germline mutations: results from a single institution\u0027s high-risk population",
  "Abstract": "As multigene panel testing for hereditary cancer syndromes becomes commonplace, germline mutations in genes other than BRCA1/2 are increasingly identified in breast cancer patients. While histopathologic features of BRCA-mutated breast cancers have been well-characterized, less is known about non-BRCA-related hereditary cancers. We herein investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of breast cancers in women with non-BRCA germline mutations. Out of 612 women who underwent germline testing, 16 (2.6%) women with 18 cancers had mutations in non-BRCA genes: ATM, CHEK2, PALB2, TP53, BMPR1A, BRIP1, MUTYH, and RAD50. An additional 2 cancers were identified in a woman with a diagnosis of Bloom syndrome (BLM mutation) who was not germline tested. Average age at diagnosis was 50 (range: 27-77), and 65% had no personal cancer history. The majority (79%) of tumors were grade 1 to 2; 35% were either lobular or ductal with lobular features. Stromal responses varied from absent to desmoplastic to sclerotic; 69% of cases had an in situ component. With the exception of a brisk lymphocytic response in BLM- and TP53-mutated cancers, lymphocytic infiltration was mild or absent. In summary, the majority of non-BRCA-related hereditary breast cancers represent the patient\u0027s sentinel malignancy. Lobular features were seen in a subset, and high-grade, immunogenic carcinomas were uncommon except in the setting of BLM and TP53 mutations. Overall, these findings demonstrate a range of involved genes in non-BRCA mutation carriers with breast cancer and histopathologic heterogeneity in the associated cancers, arguing against use of histomorphology to inform panel testing algorithms",

  "Title": "De Novo Mutations Activating Germline TP53 in an Inherited Bone-Marrow-Failure Syndrome",
  "Abstract": "Inherited bone-marrow-failure syndromes (IBMFSs) include heterogeneous genetic disorders characterized by bone-marrow failure, congenital anomalies, and an increased risk of malignancy. Many lines of evidence have suggested that p53 activation might be central to the pathogenesis of IBMFSs, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) and dyskeratosis congenita (DC). However, the exact role of p53 activation in each clinical feature remains unknown. Here, we report unique de novo TP53 germline variants found in two individuals with an IBMFS accompanied by hypogammaglobulinemia, growth retardation, and microcephaly mimicking DBA and DC. TP53 is a tumor-suppressor gene most frequently mutated in human cancers, and occasional germline variants occur in Li-Fraumeni cancer-predisposition syndrome. Most of these mutations affect the core DNA-binding domain, leading to compromised transcriptional activities. In contrast, the variants found in the two individuals studied here caused the same truncation of the protein, resulting in the loss of 32 residues from the C-terminal domain (CTD). Unexpectedly, the p53 mutant had augmented transcriptional activities, an observation not previously described in humans. When we expressed this mutant in zebrafish and human-induced pluripotent stem cells, we observed impaired erythrocyte production. These findings together with close similarities to published knock-in mouse models of TP53 lacking the CTD demonstrate that the CTD-truncation mutations of TP53 cause IBMFS, providing important insights into the previously postulated connection between p53 and IBMFSs",

  "Title": "Germline mutations in young non-smoking women with lung adenocarcinoma",
  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Although the primary cause of lung cancer is smoking, a considerable proportion of all lung cancers occur in never smokers. Gender influences the risk and characteristics of lung cancer and women are overrepresented among never smokers with the disease. Young age at onset and lack of established environmental risk factors suggest genetic predisposition. In this study, we used population-based sampling of young patients to discover candidate predisposition variants for lung adenocarcinoma in never-smoking women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed archival normal tissue material from 21 never-smoker women who had been diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma before the age of 45, and exome sequenced their germline DNA. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Potentially pathogenic variants were found in eight Cancer Gene Census germline genes: BRCA1, BRCA2, ERCC4, EXT1, HNF1A, PTCH1, SMARCB1 and TP53. The variants in TP53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 are likely to have contributed to the early onset lung cancer in the respective patients (3/21 or 14%). This supports the notion that lung adenocarcinoma can be a component of certain cancer predisposition syndromes. Fifteen genes displayed potentially pathogenic mutations in at least two patients: ABCC10, ATP7B, CACNA1S, CFTR, CLIP4, COL6A1, COL6A6, GCN1, GJB6, RYR1, SCN7A, SEC24A, SP100, TTN and USH2A. Four patients showed a mutation in COL6A1, three in CLIP4 and two in the rest of the genes. Some of these candidate genes may explain a subset of female lung adenocarcinoma",

  "Title": "Germline pathogenic variants identified in women with ovarian tumors",
  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The recognition of genes implicated in ovarian cancer risk beyond BRCA1, BRCA2, and the Lynch syndrome genes has increased the variety of testing options available to providers and patients. We report the frequency of pathogenic variants identified among individuals with ovarian cancer undergoing clinical genetic testing via a multi-gene hereditary cancer panel. METHODS: Genetic testing of up to 32 genes using a hereditary cancer panel was performed on 4439 ovarian cancer cases, and results were analyzed for frequency of pathogenic variants. Statistical comparisons were made using t-tests and Fisher\u0027s exact tests. RESULTS: The positive yield was 13.2%. While BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants were most frequent, one third (33.7%) of positive findings were in other homologous recombination genes, and accounted for over 40.0% of findings in endometrioid and clear cell cases. Women with a personal history of breast cancer (22.1%), who reported a family history of ovarian cancer (17.7%), and/or serous histology (14.7%) were most likely to harbor a pathogenic variant. Those with very early onset (\u003c30years) and late onset (\u003e/\u003d70years) ovarian cancer had low positive yields. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the genetic heterogeneity of ovarian cancer, showing that a large proportion of cases are not due to BRCA1/2 and the Lynch syndrome genes, but still have an identifiable hereditary basis. These findings substantiate the utility of multi-gene panel testing in ovarian cancer care regardless of age at diagnosis, family history, or histologic subtype, providing evidence for testing beyond BRCA1/2 and the Lynch syndrome genes",

  "Title": "A multi-gene panel beyond BRCA1/BRCA2 to identify new breast cancer-predisposing mutations by a picodroplet PCR followed by a next-generation sequencing strategy: a pilot study",
  "Abstract": "By analyzing multiple gene panels, next-generation sequencing is more effective than conventional procedures in identifying disease-related mutations that are useful for clinical decision-making. Here, we aimed to test the efficacy of an 84 genes customized-panel in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative patients. Twenty-four patients were enrolled in this study. DNA libraries were prepared using a picodroplet PCR-based approach and sequenced with the MiSeq System. Highly putative pathogenic mutations were identified in genes other than the commonly tested BRCA1/2: 2 pathogenic mutations one in TP53 and one in MUTYH; 2 missense variants in MSH6 and ATM, respectively; 2 frameshift variants in KLLN, and ATAD2, respectively; an intronic variant in ANPEP, and 3 not functionally known variants (a frameshift variant in ATM a nonsense variant in ATM and a missense variant in NFE2L2). Our results show that this molecular screening will increase diagnostic sensitivity leading to a better risk assessment in breast cancer patients and their families. This strategy could also reveal genes that have a higher penetrance for breast and ovarian cancers by matching gene mutation with familial and clinical data, thereby increasing information about hereditary breast and ovarian cancer genetics and improving cancer prevention measures or therapeutic approaches",

  "Title": "Clinical spectrum of Li-Fraumeni syndrome/Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome in Brazilian individuals with the TP53 p.R337H mutation1",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The TP53 p.R337H germline mutation is highly prevalent among children with adrenocortical tumors (ACTs) from South and Southeast Brazil. However, the prevalence of other tumors of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL) spectrum, the clinical outcomes and the potential tumor occurrence in relatives carrying this distinct TP53 mutation were not fully investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated tumor profile data and outcomes of individuals and their close relatives with the TP53 p.R337H germline mutation. A questionnaire and the Toronto protocol were used for evaluation of asymptomatic carriers of this TP53 mutation. RESULTS: The cohort of this study comprised 51 patients from 46 different families; 67% were female. All but one harbored the TP53 p.R337H mutation in heterozygous state; only one child was homozygous for this variant. Maternal allele inheritance occurred in 72% of the cases (p\u003d 0,002). In pediatric group, ACT was the most common primary tumor at the diagnosis (55%; median age\u003d 2 years). No patient of the pediatric group who initially presented with ACT developed a second primary tumor and 11% (n\u003d 3) died due to complications related to the primary tumor (median follow-up time of 81.5 months, range\u003d 3-378 months). In adult group, the main tumors at diagnosis were: adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) (23%; median age\u003d 29.5 years), breast cancer (12%; median age\u003d 38.5 years), soft tissue sarcoma (8%; median age\u003d 50.3 years) and choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) (2%; median age\u003d 18 years). Among adult patients who were diagnosed with ACC as the first primary tumor, all presented with aggressive disease as per histologic and clinical criteria at diagnosis, and 75% of patients died (median follow-up time of 19 months, range\u003d 1-69 months). Five adult patients (22%) had a second primary tumor, including bronchoalveolar lung cancer (2 cases), ACC, uterine cervical carcinoma and fibrosarcoma. The diagnosis of these tumors was established from 8 to 36 months after the first primary tumor. Three families presented more than one case of ACT. Nine malignant neoplasms were diagnosed in asymptomatic carriers using Toronto protocol. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a high frequency of TP53 p.R337H mutation in pediatric group with ACT. In addition, we observed the occurrence of other tumors of LFS/LFL spectrum and a difference in the aggressiveness of ACTs depending on the age group in which they were diagnosed. The predominance of maternal mutated allele inheritance was first demonstrated in the affected Brazilian\u0027s families",

  "Title": "Women with breast and uterine cancer are more likely to harbor germline mutations than women with breast or uterine cancer alone: A case for expanded gene testing",
  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We explored the germline mutation spectrum and prevalence among 1650 women with breast and uterine cancer (BUC) who underwent multi-gene hereditary cancer panel testing at a single commercial laboratory. METHODS: The combined frequency of mutations in 23 BC and/or UC genes was compared between BUC cases and control groups with (1) no personal cancer history; (2) BC only; and (3) UC only using logistic regression. RESULTS: Fourteen percent (n\u003d231) of BUC cases tested positive for mutations in BC and/or UC genes and were significantly more likely to test positive than individuals with BC only (P\u003c0.001), UC only (P\u003c0.01), or unaffected controls (P\u003c0.001). Analysis of gene-specific mutation frequencies revealed that MSH6, CHEK2, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PMS2, PALB2 and MSH2 were most frequently mutated among BUC cases. Compared to BC only, BRCA1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and PTEN mutations were more frequent among BUC; however, only ATM mutations were more frequent among BUC compared to UC only. All of the more commonly mutated genes have published management guidelines to guide clinical care. Of patients with a single mutation in a gene with established testing criteria (n\u003d152), only 81.6% met their respective criteria, and 65.8% met criteria for multiple syndromes. CONCLUSIONS: Women with BUC are more likely to carry hereditary cancer gene mutations than women with breast or uterine cancer alone, potentially warranting expanded genetic testing for these women. Most mutations found via multi-gene panel testing in women with BUC have accompanying published management guidelines and significant implications for clinical care",

  "Title": "Germline mutations in 40 cancer susceptibility genes among Chinese patients with high hereditary risk breast cancer",
  "Abstract": "Multigene panel testing of breast cancer predisposition genes have been extensively conducted in Europe and America, which is relatively rare in Asia however. In this study, we assessed the frequency of germline mutations in 40 cancer predisposition genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, among a large cohort of Chinese patients with high hereditary risk of BC. From 2015 to 2016, consecutive BC patients from 26 centers of China with high hereditary risk were recruited (n \u003d 937). Clinical information was collected and next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed using blood samples of participants to identify germline mutations. In total, we acquired 223 patients with putative germline mutations, including 159 in BRCA1/2, 61 in 15 other BC susceptibility genes and 3 in both BRCA1/2 and non-BRCA1/2 gene. Major mutant non-BRCA1/2 genes were TP53 (n \u003d 18), PALB2 (n \u003d 11), CHEK2 (n \u003d 6), ATM (n \u003d 6) and BARD1 (n \u003d 5). No factors predicted pathologic mutations in non-BRCA1/2 genes when treated as a whole. TP53 mutations were associated with HER-2 positive BC and younger age at diagnosis; and CHEK2 and PALB2 mutations were enriched in patients with luminal BC. Among high hereditary risk Chinese BC patients, 23.8% contained germline mutations, including 6.8% in non-BRCA1/2 genes. TP53 and PALB2 had a relatively high mutation rate (1.9 and 1.2%). Although no factors predicted for detrimental mutations in non-BRCA1/2 genes, some clinical features were associated with mutations of several particular genes",

  "Title": "Insight into genetic susceptibility to male breast cancer by multigene panel testing: Results from a multicenter study in Italy",
  "Abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) in men is rare and genetic predisposition is likely to play a relevant role in its etiology. Inherited mutations in BRCA1/2 account for about 13% of all cases and additional genes that may contribute to the missing heritability need to be investigated. In our study, a well-characterized series of 523 male BC (MBC) patients from the Italian multicenter study on MBC, enriched for non-BRCA1/2 MBC cases, was screened by a multigene custom panel of 50 cancer-associated genes. The main clinical-pathologic characteristics of MBC in pathogenic variant carriers and non-carriers were also compared. BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants were detected in twenty patients, thus, a total of 503 non-BRCA1/2 MBC patients were examined in our study. Twenty-seven of the non-BRCA1/2 MBC patients were carriers of germline pathogenic variants in other genes, including two APC p.Ile1307Lys variant carriers and one MUTYH biallelic variant carrier. PALB2 was the most frequently altered gene (1.2%) and PALB2 pathogenic variants were significantly associated with high risk of MBC. Non-BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers were more likely to have personal (p \u003d 0.0005) and family (p \u003d 0.007) history of cancer. Results of our study support a central role of PALB2 in MBC susceptibility and show a low impact of CHEK2 on MBC predisposition in the Italian population. Overall, our data indicate that a multigene testing approach may benefit from appropriately selected patients with implications for clinical management and counseling of MBC patients and their family members",

  "Title": "Deleterious Germline Mutations Are a Risk Factor for Neoplastic Progression Among High-Risk Individuals Undergoing Pancreatic Surveillance",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the risk of neoplastic progression by germline mutation status versus family history without a known germline mutation (familial risk) among individuals with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer who are undergoing surveillance. METHODS: Of 464 high-risk individuals in the Cancer of the Pancreas Screening program at Johns Hopkins Hospital who were undergoing pancreatic surveillance, 119 had a known deleterious germline mutation in a pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene; 345 met family history criteria for pancreatic surveillance but were not known to harbor a germline mutation. We used next-generation sequencing to identify previously unrecognized germline mutations among these 345 individuals. We compared the development of pancreatic cancer, high-grade dysplasia, or clinically worrisome features, adjusting for competing mortality, among all germline mutation carriers with the risk of progression in a cohort without a known germline mutation. RESULTS: Fifteen (4.3%) of 345 individuals classified as having familial risk had a previously unrecognized pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene mutation (nine that involved ATM, two BRCA2, one BRCA1, one PALB2, one TP53, and one CPA1). The cumulative incidence of pancreatic cancer, high-grade dysplasia, or worrisome features on pancreatic imaging was significantly higher in the germline mutation risk group (n \u003d 134) than in the familial risk group (n \u003d 330 [for pancreatic cancer, hazard ratio, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.0 to 8.18; P \u003d .05]). CONCLUSION: The cumulative incidence of pancreatic cancer is significantly higher among individuals with an identifiable deleterious germline mutation in a pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene than it is among individuals with a strong family history but no identified mutation. Gene testing of individuals who meet criteria for pancreatic surveillance on the basis of their family history may better define those most at risk for neoplastic progression",

  "Title": "A germline variant of TP53 in paediatric diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumour",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumour (DLGNT) is an extremely rare tumour involving the neuroaxis. At present, its exact pathogenesis and associated factors remain incompletely characterised. Recent molecular investigations in a small cohort have offered some insights into this disease. However, the role of germline findings has not yet been fully explored in affected patients. The authors present a case of DLGNT, focusing on the clinical and molecular features with reference to current disease knowledge. METHODS: A 4-year-old male presented with raised intracranial pressure symptoms secondary to extensive leptomeningeal disease of the brain and spine. Preliminary impression was that of an inflammatory lesion. RESULTS: A lumbar biopsy of the lesion confirmed DLGNT on routine diagnostic examination. Further molecular analysis of his tumour and blood demonstrated a previously unreported TP53 exon 5 (c.147V \u003e I) germline variant. Based on the latest DLGNT molecular subtyping classification, his tumour falls into the group with better clinical outcome. However, his germline findings may add an extra layer of uncertainty to his overall prognosis. CONCLUSION: Given that much remains unknown in many rare paediatric tumours at this stage, isolated findings found in an individual may be of significance. Supplementary genetic information, together with tumour molecular analysis, add to our current understanding of this uncommon disease. This case highlights the benefit of combined clinical and molecular efforts, including germline testing, especially for children affected by such challenging neoplasms",

  "Title": "From uncertainty to pathogenicity: Clinical and functional interrogation of a rare TP53 in-frame deletion",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a highly penetrant cancer predisposition syndrome caused by heterozygous germline mutations in the TP53 gene. Although several missense and null TP53 mutations are well established as disease-causing, little is known about the pathogenicity and cancer risks associated with small in-frame deletions. This leads to challenges in variant classification and subsequent difficulty making a molecular diagnosis. We report the genetic testing process for a pediatric patient diagnosed with an undifferentiated high-grade brain tumor following his mother\u0027s diagnosis of early-onset bilateral breast cancer. Sequential testing revealed that both harbored a heterozygous three nucleotide deletion in exon 7 of TP53 (c.764_766delTCA; I255del), which was classified as a variant of uncertain significance. Since the maternal family history was void of any other LFS spectrum tumors, additional information was needed to effectively classify the variant. Targeted TP53 testing of the patient\u0027s maternal grandparents confirmed that neither carried the variant; this new de novo data upgraded the variant classification to Likely Pathogenic. To assess the impact of this mutation on the encoded p53 protein, additional in vitro analyses were performed. Structural modeling revealed that the mutation disrupted the architecture of the DNA binding domain, suggesting that it might negatively impact p53 function. Consistent with this notion, the I255del mutant exhibited significantly impaired transcriptional activity and greatly reduced growth suppressive properties, similar to more well-characterized LFS-associated p53 mutants. This report illustrates the importance of seeking additional evidence to assign proper pathogenicity classification, which enables optimal genetic counseling and medical management of individuals with LFS and their at-risk relatives",

  "Title": "Germline TP53 mutation spectrum in Sudanese premenopausal breast cancer patients: correlations with reproductive factors",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The role of non-genetic factors as modifiers of TP53-related hereditary breast cancer (BC) risk is debated. In this regard, little is known about the impact of germline TP53 mutations on BC in sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease often presents in non-contraceptive multiparous premenopausal women with extended history of breastfeeding. Herein, we report the germline TP53 mutations found in a series of 92 Sudanese premenopausal BC patients characterized for reproductive history. METHODS: The entire TP53 coding sequence, including intron-exon boundaries and UTRs, was analyzed via DHPLC and direct sequencing, and the association of TP53 genotypes with BC risk and with individual lifetime exposures to reproductive factors was investigated with statistical tools. RESULTS: The germline TP53 mutation spectrum comprised 20 variants, 15 in the non-coding and 5 in the coding region. The latter included a deleterious missense mutation, c.817C\u003eT (p.Arg273Cys), in a unique patient, and the common and functionally relevant coding polymorphism at amino acid 72 [Pro72Arg (rs1042522)]. The non-coding mutations included c.919+1G\u003eA, a known deleterious splice site mutation, also in a unique patient. Notably, the 2 carriers of deleterious TP53 mutations clustered in the subset of cases with stronger reproductive history relative to childbearing age. When analyzed in comparison to population controls, the codon 72 polymorphism did not reveal associations with BC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the codon 72 Arg\u003ePro polymorphism is not implicated in premenopausal BC susceptibility, whereas multiparity and breastfeeding might be BC risk factors for carriers of deleterious TP53 mutations",

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Due to historically low uptake of genetic testing, the mutational spectrum of Asians with Hereditary Breast Cancer (HBC) is not well understood. This study sought to understand the incidence and spectrum of germline mutations in Asian patients with suspected HBC in a clinic setting. METHODS: 1056 patients with suspected HBC were seen in our Cancer (CA) Genetics Clinic from 2000-2017, of which 460 underwent genetic testing. RESULTS: Of 460 probands tested, 93% were female, 61% Chinese, 90% had prior CA, with 19% (77/414) having \u003e/\u003d2 primary CA. Median age at CA-diagnosis was 43y (17-83); 70% had Breast CA (BC) and 25% Ovarian CA (OC). 34% had young-onset BC, 8% bilateral BC, and 4% BC/OC. Majority had family history of BC (53%) or OC (20%). 57% underwent multigene testing (14-49 genes), 34% targeted testing, and 8% predictive testing. 30% were found to have a pathogenic mutation: 80% in BRCA1/2 (8 novel mutations noted). Of 33 non-BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations detected, 61% were in 11 BC genes while 39% were in non-BC genes suggestive of alternative CA syndromes. Testing beyond BRCA1/2 impacted management for 15.9% (22/138) of carriers, but extensive testing identified variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in up to 44.5% of probands. Restricting multigene panel testing to a guideline-based 20-gene panel including Lynch Syndrome genes was found to be most optimal, detecting 94.6% of mutation carriers while reducing VUS rate to 21.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Evolution of CA Genetics testing strategy to a multigene approach facilitated detection of pathogenic mutations in non-BRCA1/2 genes and aided management. Guideline-based panel testing is feasible and can be offered in Asians with suspected HBC",

  "Title": "Diagnostic yield and clinical utility of a comprehensive gene panel for hereditary tumor syndromes",
  "Abstract": "Background: In a considerable number of patients with a suspected hereditary tumor syndrome (HTS), no underlying germline mutation is detected in the most likely affected genes. The present study aimed to establish and validate a large gene panel for HTS, and determine its diagnostic yield and clinical utility. Methods: The study cohort comprised 173 patients with suspected, but unexplained, HTS (group U) and 64 HTS patients with a broad spectrum of known germline mutations (group K). All patients in group U presented with early age at onset, multiple tumors, and/or a familial clustering of various tumor types; no germline mutation had been identified during routine diagnostics. Sequencing of leukocyte DNA was performed for the 94 HTS genes of the Illumina TruSightCancer Panel and 54 additional HTS genes. Results: The sensitivity of the panel to identify known germline variants was 99.6%. In addition to known mutations, a total of 192 rare, potentially pathogenic germline variants in 86 genes were identified. Neither the proportion of rare variants per patient (group K: 0.9 variants; group U: 0.8 variants) nor the proportion of variants in the most frequently mutated, moderately penetrant genes CHEK2 and ATM showed significant inter-group difference. Four of the five patients from group U with a truncating CHEK2 mutation had thyroid cancer, pointing to a broader tumor spectrum in patients with pathogenic CHEK2 variants. In 22% of patients from group K, a further potential causative variant was identified. Here, the most interesting finding was an NF1 nonsense mutation in a child with a known TP53 frameshift mutation. In 17% of patients from group U, potential causative variants were identified. In three of these patients (2%), mutations in PMS2, PTEN, or POLD1 were considered to be causative. In both groups, incidental findings with presumptive predictive value were generated. Conclusions: The gene panel identified the genetic cause in some prescreened, unexplained HTS patients and generated incidental findings. Some patients harbored predicted pathogenic mutations in more than one established HTS gene, rendering interpretation of the respective alterations challenging. Established moderate risk genes showed an almost equal distribution among patients with known and unexplained disease",

  "Title": "Report of a bi-allelic truncating germline mutation in TP53",
  "Abstract": "The TP53 gene is fundamental to genomic integrity, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis; it is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. Heterozygous germline mutations cause the autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome, Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. Homozygous germline TP53 mutations in humans are rare. We report an infant from a consanguineous family who presented with synchronous malignancies. Remarkably, he carries a homozygous germline TP53 mutation (NM_000546.4:c.52delA), predicted to cause protein truncation. The family history is consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome",

  "Title": "TP53 germline mutation testing in early-onset breast cancer: findings from a nationwide cohort",
  "Abstract": "Early-onset breast cancer may be due to Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS). Current national and international guidelines recommend that TP53 genetic testing should be considered for women with breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 31 years. However, large studies investigating TP53 mutation prevalence in this population are scarce. We collected nationwide laboratory records for all young breast cancer patients tested for TP53 mutations in the Netherlands. Between 2005 and 2016, 370 women diagnosed with breast cancer younger than 30 years of age were tested for TP53 germline mutations, and eight (2.2%) were found to carry a (likely) pathogenic TP53 sequence variant. Among BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation negative women without a family history suggestive of LFS or a personal history of multiple LFS-related tumours, the TP53 mutation frequency was \u003c 1% (2/233). Taking into consideration that TP53 mutation prevalence was comparable or even higher in some studies selecting patients with breast cancer onset at older ages or HER2-positive breast cancers, raises the question of whether a very early age of onset is an appropriate single TP53 genetic testing criterion",

  "Title": "Prevalence of germline mutations in the TP53 gene in patients with early-onset breast cancer in the Mexican population",
  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heterozygous germline TP53 gene mutations result in Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS). Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent tumor in young women with LFS. An important issue related to BC in the Mexican population is the average age at diagnosis, which is approximately 11 years younger than that of patients in the United States (U.S.) and Europe. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of germline mutations in TP53 among young Mexican BC patients. METHODS: We searched for germline mutations in the TP53 gene using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 78 BC patients younger than 45 years old (yo) who tested negative for BRCA1/2 mutations. A group of 509 Mexican women aged 45yo or older without personal or family BC history (parents/grandparents) was used as a control. RESULTS: We identified five patients with pathogenic variants in the TP53 gene, equivalent to 6.4% (5/78). Among patients diagnosed at age 36 or younger, 9.4% (5/55) had pathogenic TP53 mutations. Three of these variants were missense mutations (c.844C \u003e T, c.517G \u003e A, and c.604C \u003e T), and the other two mutations were frameshifts (c.291delC and c.273dupC) and had not been reported previously. We also identified a variant of uncertain clinical significance (VUS), c.672G \u003e A, which causes a putative splice donor site mutation. All patients with TP53 mutations had high-grade and HER2-positive tumors. None of the 509 patients in the healthy control group had mutations in TP53. CONCLUSIONS: Among Mexican BC patients diagnosed at a young age, we identified a high proportion with germline mutations in the TP53 gene. All patients with the TP53 mutations had a family history suggestive of LFS. To establish the clinical significance of the VUS found, additional studies are needed. Pathogenic variants of TP53 may explain a substantial fraction of BC in young women in the Mexican population. Importantly, none of these mutations or other pathological variants in TP53 were found in the healthy control group",

  "Title": "Frequency of pathogenic germline variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2 and TP53 in ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed in women under the age of 50 years",
  "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-obligate precursor of invasive ductal breast cancer, and approximately 20% of screen-detected tumours are pure DCIS. Most risk factors for breast cancer have similar associations with DCIS and IDC; however, there is limited data on the prevalence of the known high and moderate penetrance breast cancer predisposition genes in DCIS and which women with DCIS should be referred for genetic screening. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of germline variants in BRCA2, BRCA1, CHEK2, PALB2 and TP53 in DCIS in women aged less than 50 years of age. METHODS: After DNA extraction from the peripheral blood, Access Array technology (Fluidigm) was used to amplify all exons of these five known breast cancer predisposition genes using a custom made targeted sequencing panel in 655 cases of pure DCIS presenting in women under the age of 50 years together with 1611 controls. RESULTS: Case-control analysis revealed an excess of pathogenic variants in BRCA2 (OR \u003d 27.96, 95%CI 6.56-119.26, P \u003d 2.0 x 10(-10)) and CHEK2 (OR \u003d 8.04, 95%CI 2.93-22.05, P \u003d 9.0 x 10(-6)), with weaker associations with PALB2 (P \u003d 0.003), BRCA1 (P \u003d 0.007) and TP53 (P \u003d 0.02). For oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive DCIS the frequency of pathogenic variants was 9% under the age of 50 (14% with a family history of breast cancer) and 29% under the age of 40 (42% with a family history of breast cancer). For ER-negative DCIS, the frequency was 9% (16% with a family history of breast cancer) and 8% (11% with a family history of breast cancer) under the ages of 50 and 40, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that breast tumourigenesis in women with pathogenic variants in BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, BRCA1 and TP53 can involve a DCIS precursor stage and that the focus of genetic testing in DCIS should be on women under the age of 40 with ER-positive DCIS",

  "Title": "Germline cancer susceptibility gene variants, somatic second hits, and survival outcomes in patients with resected pancreatic cancer",
  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Germline variants in double-strand DNA damage repair (dsDDR) genes (e.g., BRCA1/2) predispose to pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and may predict sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy and poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. We sought to determine the prevalence and significance of germline cancer susceptibility gene variants in PDAC with paired somatic and survival analyses. METHODS: Using a customized next-generation sequencing panel, germline/somatic DNA was analyzed from 289 patients with resected PDAC ascertained without preselection for high-risk features (e.g., young age, personal/family history). All identified variants were assessed for pathogenicity. Outcomes were analyzed using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: We found that 28/289 (9.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.5-13.7%) patients carried pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline variants, including 21 (7.3%) dsDDR gene variants (3 BRCA1, 4 BRCA2, 14 other dsDDR genes [ATM, BRIP1, CHEK2, NBN, PALB2, RAD50, RAD51C]), 3 Lynch syndrome, and 4 other genes (APC p.I1307K, CDKN2A, TP53). Somatic sequencing and immunohistochemistry identified second hits in the tumor in 12/27 (44.4%) patients with germline variants (1 failed sequencing). Compared with noncarriers, patients with germline dsDDR gene variants had superior overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54; 95% CI 0.30-0.99; P \u003d 0.05). CONCLUSION: Nearly 10% of PDAC patients harbor germline variants, although the majority lack somatic second hits, the therapeutic significance of which warrants further study",

  "Title": "Germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes in high grade serous ovarian cancer in Serbia",
  "Abstract": "Clinical criteria for genetic testing of genes other than BRCA1/2 in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) still do not exist. We assessed the frequency and predictors of deleterious mutations in 19 cancer predisposition genes in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) in Serbia. Next-generation sequencing was used to identify germline mutations in the whole coding regions of a gene panel. Patients\u0027 characteristics and sequencing data were summarized with descriptive statistics and compared using chi-square test. Among 131 HGSOC patients, 23 had BRCA1 (17.6%) while 5 had BRCA2 (3.8%) mutation. In addition, 9 (6.9%) pathogenic mutations were detected in other genes including BRIP1 (n \u003d 2;1.5%), CHEK2 (n \u003d 2;1.5%), NBN (n \u003d 3;2.3%) and RAD51C (n \u003d 2;1.5%). Factors that predicted for BRCA1/2 mutations were: breast and ovarian cancers in the same patient (p \u003d 0.031), young age of EOC (p \u003d 0.029), menstrual status (p \u003d 0.004) and family history of cancer (p \u003c 0.0001). However, these factors did not predict for mutations in other cancer susceptibility genes. Applying established referral criteria for genetic testing in Serbia will help identify BRCA1/2 mutation carriers but will not help identify mutations in other cancer susceptibility genes. Until better predictors emerge we should be performing wider genetic testing of EOC in order to identify all mutation carriers",

  "Title": "Genotype-phenotype associations within the Li-Fraumeni spectrum: a report from the German Registry",
  "Abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by pathogenic TP53 variants. The condition represents one of the most relevant genetic causes of cancer in children and adults due to its frequency and high cancer risk. The term Li-Fraumeni spectrum reflects the evolving phenotypic variability of the condition. Within this spectrum, patients who meet specific LFS criteria are diagnosed with LFS, while patients who do not meet these criteria are diagnosed with attenuated LFS. To explore genotype-phenotype correlations we analyzed 141 individuals from 94 families with pathogenic TP53 variants registered in the German Cancer Predisposition Syndrome Registry. Twenty-one (22%) families had attenuated LFS and 73 (78%) families met the criteria of LFS. NULL variants occurred in 32 (44%) families with LFS and in two (9.5%) families with attenuated LFS (P value \u003c 0.01). Kato partially functional variants were present in 10 out of 53 (19%) families without childhood cancer except adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) versus 0 out of 41 families with childhood cancer other than ACC alone (P value \u003c 0.01). Our study suggests genotype-phenotype correlations encouraging further analyses.",
